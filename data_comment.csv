14,The room was not cleaned when we checked in. used tissues and bottle lid between the bed and night stand. I requested the room to be cleaned the next day but they just made the bed and never changed the linen. The high reviews look fake to me,0
80,"My wife and I stayed for one night - we saw it as a convenient stay for onward travel to next morning. Can't fault the location in terms of its vicinity to many attractions but but I have to say it was extremely noisy, we must have got about 2-3 hours sleep, with all the noise from the traffic outside and constant banging inside the hotel which seemed to go on all night. It was the noisiest place we have stayed in. ",0
401,"Exhausted. No soundproofing so your kept up all night by other guests, or hoovering etc. There was a leak from the roof so they had to hoover the water up which isn’t there fault but really the roof shouldn’t be leaking that badly.. and after already being kept up an hour of hoovering and calls to our room at 7am to ask to be allowed in to check water (our room was fine) was not ideal.   I was offered a discount at checkout but not told how much and just saw on my receipt it was only 10%… when we barely slept, avoid.    Other issues: wall paper peeling, plug sockets not properly attached to the wall (hazard), stains on lamp. ",0
432,"Terrible experience, services are definitively not in line with a 4 stars hotel: - check in takes too long . . . Had 4 couples before me and I had to wait 50 minutes!!!!  - two people in the room and only one Bathrobe and slippers - restaurant room service poor: we ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress broke the wine cork and cleaned the inside of the bottle with her fingers (I guess this is one of the Covid-19 measures of the hotel!!!!) - breakfast time unclear. We have been informed during the check-in that breakfast was from 7am to 10am. In the morning at 7am breakfast was not open and different people told us different starting time . . . At least they reduced the amount of the breakfast from the room rate.  I have seen many hotels in Italy but this is really the worst 4 stars hotel I have ever been.",0
470,"I have been staying in starhotel echo whenever I am in Milan for work for the past years. I choose star echo because of it services and hospitality  but recent 2 years the experience was bad but this year is the worst for me and I will not plan to stay here again for all my future business trips.   I bought an extra night stay at star echo so when I touchdown in the morning I can check in immediately for my convenience. Apparently there is this new policy that if I don’t show up the day before I am consider no-show and my room will be cancelled but I informed the hotel ahead that I will arrives in the morning but the poor staff is explaining it’s the new policy that no show = cancelled rooms no matter what. Apparently I am not the only one facing this problem, other guests seem to have this problem too. How very inconvenient and end up I have to pay extra for the whole hotel stay and get my colleague who helps me book this hotel sort out the previous hotel payment. Feels like a scam.   I would say overall the current Star Echo hotel Milan is really poorly managed by I assumed the new management with their new policies and the amenities are not available you have to request and go get it yourself. It is equivalent to like a budget hotel standard. The pillow is not as fluffy and comfortable like it used to be, you can feel the vibration from the train underground even if you stay at higher level.",0
494,"The hotel is next to the central railway station. We booked a suite for 350 euros per night and expected high service.  It was on the 3rd floor but we still could hear underground trains. The water in the shower was brown when you switched it on. Just after 5 min running it became transparent. It happened every day.  The worst part was with my money: I had a prepaid accommodation, so everything was fine until I asked to extend my booking for a few more days. I was told that I would be charged on my check out day. Here my nightmare has started: every night I saw ""pre-authorisations"" charged on my card. Hotel staff couldn't help me as their system did that automatically and they even didn't see all of the charges. By check out moment I was overcharged for 900 euros more than I had to pay. At check out I was assured that over charge would be returned in a few days cause it was just pre-authorisation and that my card was removed from the system. A few days after check out I got another charge for 1900 euros from this hotel. So total overcharged amount was 2800 euros! I called to the hotel but they didn't see these charges in their system. I had to deal with my bank and I got a refund by the end of the month, in about 3 weeks! I also need to notice that with all this pre-authorisation and refund process I lost about 100 euro just on currency exchange rate.  Worst customer experience! Scammers!",0
599,"In a ‘king superior room’ on the 12 floor with a northeast view (#1203) at a rate of mote than $700 per night, the air conditioning, despite being turned off, continues emitting a continuos high frequecy sound non stop keeping you awake all night, preventing skeep. Serious housekeeping should have identified the problem prior to making the room available. We called the front desk who proposed to sent a technician who never showed up. After a second call one hour later, a technician came by , confirmed the high frequency noise problem but could not and could not solve it. The front desk daid they could not offer another room because the hotel is said to be full.  On a side note, the music a of the bar at the 14th floor can still be heard at the 12th floor, but the nuisance is very minor in comparison to the air conditioning noise.  The room refurbishment, compared with our stay 5 years ago is a plus and nicely done, although superficially performed in the bathroom. There is no central command for managing the lights, especially for turning off the night light in the bathroom which cannot be turned off and jeeps slightly illuminating the room. Eye shades are a must.  So , still nicely situated hotel in the meat packing district, nice rooms, but technology of air conditioning and lighting ruin the experience at more than 700 dollars per night.",0
841,"We paid over 1200 dollars to stay here and I am not allowed to bring a guest over. Ridiculous. I get it if it was multiple people, but a single guest on NYE? Get out of here.one of the worst experiences I’ve had.",0
893,"Room 302 obviously had water damage . They even had a air purifier plugged in which indicates they were aware of the problem when they allocated that room. I could not sleep due to the foul smell . As well there weee hairs on the bed and filthy soap holder in the shower. I felt very unwell in the morning, my nose totally blocked and my eyes were puffy . I  found huge amounts of black mould covering what was the bar fridge door , the bar fridge was missing. My friends room 301 was NOT much better due to strong musty odour battling with cheap overpowering room deodoriser . Still waiting to hear from the manager after calling and leaving a message. Do not stay there! You pay for what you get .",0
894,"We stayed in the Vulcan Hotel three weeks ago for one night. We booked the hotel directly through the hotel's website.  Before booking the room we called the hotel that we would like to use the Stay NSW voucher and the person on the reception at the time instructed us on the phone to include a note in the booking that we would like to use the voucher and it would be deducted from the payment when we submit the booking. This didn't happen and the full amount was deducted. The receptionist at the time of arrival apologized and scanned the voucher and promised to refund the $50 voucher value, which was fine.  However, whilst $50.50 were refunded, $50.50 were simultaneously taken out of our account. When we queried this the next morning at checkout the receptionist ensured us that this will be refunded within the next two days. 3 weeks later the funds are still not refunded plus the Vulcan Hotel is still holding a $50.50 security deposit (We have confirmed that the Vulcan hotel is the merchant withholding $50.50 with our bank twice). We understand that mistakes can happen and we have emailed and called the hotel several times to resolve this amicably and the staff asks us to provide our bank statement! Whilst this is already questionable, we have sent the transactions which clearly show that $50.50 were first deducted before credited, which cancels it out. We tried to kindly explain this but the staff was rude and condescending and suggested we call our bank who can explain it to us. We did call the bank and they confirmed that Vulcan hotel is still holding the security deposit and that there was no actual refund. At this stage the Vulcan hotel has charged us the full fee and has taken an extra $50 from the NSW government. Whilst we still think that this was likely an honest mistake and hope that the hotel will resolve it, we are writing this review mainly to warn other customers to double check in case they use the Stay NSW voucher, so it doesn't happen to others. We have also made contact with Service NSW to alert them to this. Additional, we had breakfast at the hotel and witnessed how the owner shamed the chef in front of our eyes when she stated that the chef made the breakfast too big for other customers, which was very embarrassing especially as the breakfast portions were very small! We also witnessed that the owner asked the chef to reuse the butter from one table for other customers. Whilst it is certainly reasonable to reduce waste it may not be to the liking of some customers and the health department particularly during Covid times.  Other than that the rooms were fine and very clean and the location is great, and the owner gave us some helpful tips in the evening of our arrival. We have waited three weeks to write this review, because we hoped that the Vulcan hotel would have the courtesy to resolve the issue, but unfortunately they still haven't.",0
897,Horrible. I stayed here 2 weeks ago. They charged me even though I didn't use Carpark. I requested Carpark card for UTS parking but the card didn't work and I returned it. One of the worker said he will cancel the charge however it still was charged.  I called multiple times and sent an email but this issue but nothing coming back.   I called again 2 days to get refund but still no answers and treating me like a lier when I talked to rmthe reception,0
945,"I booked total of 7 days on both properties (2 days backpackers, 2 days studios and 3 days back in backpackers). On my arrival date, I was told that backpackers is fully-booked hence i will stay 1 day only in backpacker and will be UPGRADED in 4 bedroom on the 2nd day (1day upgrade). However, i was surprised to learn that I have to pay for that extra ""upgrade"" without even asking if that is ok with me.  The following day, I had to check-out and transfer to the studios. Check-out in backpacker is 10am and check-in in studios is not until 2pm. Therefore, I had to leave my valuables in the reception. When i got back, I asked for my bag and the guy manning the reception took my bag from behind and opened it WITHOUT ASKING FOR MY PERMISSION!!! He said that they need to check it to confirm that it belongs to me. I understand the safety for all customers. BUT HE OPENED MY BAG, TOOK AND LOOKED AT MY PASSPORT like as if it was not his first time opening my bag. HE SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION FIRST! Note that my bag got several pockets and zippers but he knew where my passport is!. This is just so unacceptable! ITS TERRIBLE!!!  On my third day, I booked for a 2-day trip in meteora. I already paid 4 days of my stay, so I asked the receptionist in the studios if I can get a refund for the 1 day (32 euro) that I will not be staying in the property. Also, if refund is not possible, would they be able to not to charge me on 1 of the days that I havent paid yet. The receptionist just coldly said they can't. I was not really expecting a refund but at least a little bit of niceness would do.   Additionally, there's huge difference with the way the breakfast is served on both properties. Studio is more presentable and availability is there, while in backpacker, they seem not want to serve anything. 3 days in backpacker, I had nothing but coffee because there's nothing few slices of bread, butter and 3 hard boiled eggs.",0
960,"I spent two nights in Athens Backpackers, in a dormitory composed of six beds. When it comes to the cleanliness of the dormitory, I have no complaints. I made some new friends as well. But the biggest disappointment is that I consulted the reception on the eve of my departure and made a humble request to book a taxi for airport transfer in the following morning. The person at the reception made the booking in front of me and confirmed to me that the fee would be 23 €. Well, it was still expensive but I agreed to this price. However, in the morning, the driver was waiting for me at the reception. We walked towards the glossy black car. When I arrived at the airport, the driver told me that the transport cost was 45 €. He called the Hotel in front of me and the person on the phone confirmed that it was 45€. I said I would write about this on Trip Advisor and I was told to do so. I would not recommend this hotel, especially when such dishonest tricks are used to rob travelers out of their little money.",0
968,"Hello,  I booked his with high expectations as it was highly recommended. The receptionist welcomed us very rudely at 9.30am when we reached. We had requested on booking.com for an early check-in.  We agreed to wait for sometime as it was not reasonable to expect it immediately. Here I am writing a review at 1.20pm still waiting for the receptionist to let me know if she has any to.ready.   Hostels are known for their warm.welcome and kind gesture. I won't recommend it to any backpacker to come and experience it. ",0
1093,"Me and my friend (two female travellers) stayed there for three nights. The staff was lovely and they treated us very well, BUT on the day that we were checking out an incident happened. We wanted to pay by card (which we've been using with no problems on other places). The terminal machine wasn't working and the receptionist called the owner. When he came he treated us very impolitely and rude for NO reason, since the only thing we wanted is to pay HIS business. We tried a different card and It didn't work either. We had to go to the cash machine and pay by cash. We requested an invoice and all we got is a receipt. We asked again for a proper invoice and finally it got sorted. The owner didn't apologised or changed his attitude toward us. We felt extremely unpleasant and unwelcome. It was a real pity that we had to leave this place on that note. I would not recommend anybody to stay at this hotel for this unnecessary and disagreeable experience with the owner.",0
1449,This is the nosiest - ever - hotel I have been staying in. Not that there has been some parties or particular events but just because my room as some others are in between the reception and the street. Very difficult to sleep as you have always people getting in or away up to late in the night.,0
1602,"This hotel was one of the WORST hotels I have ever stayed in! Would never recommend it to anyone! First off, bathroom shower overfills within 2 minutes and water starts pouring out everywhere reaching the main entrance of the room. Had to switch rooms and had the same exact problem. The light fixtures were broken, asked to have it fixed, nothing was done. The hotel is literally in the boom docks, had to take 2 trains with multiple stops just to reach the city centre which would take almost an hour! Attendant when checked in was very rude and obnoxious. The quality of service is simply horrible. One star hotel with 5 star prices! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎",0
1623,Stayed here for 4 days and wish I had gone some where else Tried to over charge me twice for the room  Bedding had stains on  Curtain hanging off  Bathroom door unlockable as it was all bent We only at here one because the food was over cooked and over priced for what was basically a microwave meal If you have a pull out bed sleep on the floor as it will be more comfortable  And if you ask not have your room cleaned don’t expect them to honor that it won’t happen  On the day of check out they will start knocking on your door at 08.30 and the roughly every 30 mins until you leave the room  And don’t also expect to be told anything at check in such as when check out it because you will have to ask for all that information yourself ,0
1634,Disgusting. Staff rude and adamant. Poor customer service and very disrespectful. Reception lady staff very rude. Lady completely hung up phone on me when I called to enquire about my booking. Breakfast bad,0
1637,"The review is in my honest own personal opinion based on a stay there some time ago, we still have not got over it. We  were invited to a low cost breakfast there the year before and the staff 'appeared' OK.  We then returned for a two night stay during London Expo weekend and the whole experience from start to finish was a horror story, you could not even dream it. This bank of hotels 'appears' to be mainly used for airport overnight stopovers or London Excel over-spill. Just be warned you are one of many here and customer service is not on their radar. The breakfast is very good, however the staff who run it are rude, confrontational and one of them is very provocative. The management here appears poor and Hilton need to look into this. The room was  disgusting at all levels and I would not know where to start on my concerns. Basically it should not have been issued out as a room. Hilton refunded me 50% of the stay, however the attitude of staff there was utterly shocking and until they remove that breakfast supervisor there it will not get any better. I am still having nightmares months later.",0
1640,"It took over an hour to check in, the 2 receptionist an Chinese guy and an Asian guy (The most terrible customer service, they were rude and clearly had no idea what they was doing, you can check the CCTV cameras) claimed the system had issues. They had to restart the computer 2 times. Failed to find the booking. They charged me pre authorization 2 times. It was such an embarrassment, clear negative customer experience and no apologies offered. This ruined my stay and being an Honors member I felt very disappointed and let down. Won’t be using this branch anymore.",0
1713,"They refused to let me check in for three days because I had not booked early.they gave me reason all rooms are booked and no room available. I was required to mail a request for booking while waiting at the lobby. Earlier I checked in websites regarding availability of rooms and the websites showing rooms were available,only then I decided to visit.Disappointing.",0
1945,We went to Asia for a 3 week honeymoon trip. Japan was our last leg of it. We took a 1am flight to japan and arrived around 11am. They told us check in was at 2pm. Ok so we left to go have lunch. Came back around 1240pm Bc it started pouring rain outside and they still said check in is at 2pm. We have stayed over five hotels during this trip and all of them allowed us to check in a bit earlier. I haven’t slept and i am soaked from the rain.  I’m exhausted so I tried to rest in their lobby and the front desk made us move bc we were inconveniencing them. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. Customer service is lacking compared to what i am use to. Can’t even check in to change clothes/shower. I am writing this as I wait in their lobby. 👎🏻,0
2392,"Hotel was small but enough for quick stay and located very close to Acropolis. However they charged twice for a single booking. Had to call them twice to cancel the second booking. When we arrived on day of, the receptionist told me that there were two bookings existing. One for two beds and the other for one bed. Booking was a big inconvenience.",0
2572,"1) Hardware: good 2) Customer service: terrible a) hotel room don't have cold air-con and room tempature kept at 26-27 degree all night.  However, lobby, corrider and restaurant had cold air con switched on and working !!!! b) email customer service and response is ""your feedback will help us identify the opportunities where we can focus on making improvements. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us"" c) complaining at lobby, air-con fixed one night for a few hours. next morning tempeature is 26 again",0
2579,"No seriously. the hairdryer was the only source of heating!   It was winter, but it was so cold... really cold... we needed an extra duvet. But it was damp too, so cold and damp isn’t a good combination. We asked about the air con unit, but no it only cooled, no reverse cycle for heating.  Samuel was helpful, but these things left him helpless. So we ended up seeking refuge at the cinema and YMCA to keep warm.  The rooms are small, with an integral shower and toilet, but it’s not sealed from the main room, so moisture can easily escape.  It was centrally located, and that’s the main thing in its favour.  We wouldn’t go back, we’d rather pay another 10$ or even double to get somewhere that we could at least go back to after a days exploring and relax in front of the TV.",0
2977,"I reserved for 5 days stay and confirmed my reservation with the hotel staff , when i have arrived at 2 am the staff told me that the reservation not confirmed and there's no room available leaving me at 2 am to look for another hotel  And in the reception we heard a loud cry of a child so how was the rooms ?!!  It was horrible experience ..",0
2978,"My experience with them began at a sour note. I was mis quoted a higher per night charge by their staff over whatsapp. Upon arrival I found out the actual charges which was lesser than what was quoted earlier. However the staff was extremely rude and told me to either pay the higher price or to leave the hotel at 4AM. Their staff continued to be extremely uncooperative throughout my 10 day stay there.  Despite booking for my 10 day stay in advance they kept changing my room frequently. The condition of the rooms was deplorable. Matters covers had various stains and odour. Room service was non existent. Rooms lacked hygiene or proper maintenance.  It's an extremely old and outdated construction with very very small rooms, no lift and the staff was beyond horrible. Rooms did not offer mini bar. Or fridge. The towels offered were dirty. The intercom system was broken. The break fast served was mediocre at best.   All in all a terrible experience wouldn't recommend to anyone.",0
2991,Location is in the middle of no where and dont have the elevator with not standard stairs and 4 floor. At the arrival moment they sent us to the top floor and every where of thr hotel was smeling the paint. Tottaly dont waste your money on this hotel,0
3022,"Im my previous review I mentioned that this hotel was terrible but now I found out that they are the biggest fraud.. As we did not stay in this hotel due to unavailability of booked rooms, they agreed not to charge any amount on our credit card. We got this in writing and went to another hotel. However now almost after 8 months, this pricks have charged my credit card with the amount. Now I am struggling to get my money back. We are stuck between the hotel not responding to booking.com and booking.com not paying us back as promised.   PLESE DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. I CANNOT STRESS IT ENOUGH BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE UNPROFESSIONAL & TRUELY JERKS!!!",0
3028,"Excellent location very close to the old city sites, just a few blocks (hilly) from the Hippodrome, obelisks, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, etc... The staff were pleasant, and the hotel was small and old style authentic, but the room looked tired and worn out, with rips in the wallpaper, a flat screen TV hanging on the wall on an angle that was plugged into a dangling power bar, and didn't seem to receive any channels. One of the ""fresh"" bath towels had a small blood stain and hair on it. The little bottles of shampoo (?), conditioner (?) and soap (?) were unlabelled and none of the staff knew which was which. We were there for two nights and on the first night at about 10 pm, we were in bed and heard a key in the lock. Before we could get out of bed, the door opened and a male staff person looked in, to which we said ""excuse me!? we're in this room!"" and with a murmur he closed the door, apparently unaware we were booked in the room? Creepy and unnerving. The shower doors were stiff and hard to open and close, and the shower rod supporting the handheld shower was not properly attached to the wall.  Our stay wasn't a disaster, but certainly not of the minimum standards we would expect.  Not angry, but certainly disappointed.",0
3030,"I booked a room with a king bed in this hotel on booking.com with a fairly good price and I was very happy and excited to get there with my boyfriend to spend the best vacation ever! Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. First, they told us that we need to pay additional fees if we wanted to have a second person in a room that is obviously for two people. After I contested this additional fees, they told me that we cannot even stay as two unmarried people in the same room anyways, because it was not a decent thing. I wanted them to cancel the room, and in fact started begging, but they could not care less. After all this ordeal, they have already taken out the money for the hotel room that they obviously are not going to let me in. Thanks for ruining my one vacation this year even before getting there. Avoid this place at all costs.",0
3039,"We booked our reservation with booking.com -- a non refundable reservation- months before our trip on what appeared to be a good deal.   I reviewed the reviews the closer we got to our trip and what I feared happened based on recent review -- our room was not available and we were moved to another hotel for the 1st night. While I thought I would be ready to deal with this -- after a 10 hour flight from D.C. I just wanted to get a room and start our trip -- We were offered 2 options and took the best of the two.   What has me upset was the lying as to why the room was not available --- We were told that the room above had a flood which damaged our room -- the room below.   After our first night - the following day we walked back and were given a room with balcony that we had reserved. The other room was a dark - smoke smelly room at the Stone Hotel.   When we checked back in -- we met with Omar, the manager/owner, who indicated that they had merged 2 hotels and that the reservation systems were of synch ---- a total different story.   Is this Hotel acting like a consolidator to fill close by hotels ---- who knows --- just know that you may not get your room and may have to stay at another inferior hotel -- causing inconveniences and bad experiences.",0
3040,"I have booked and confirmed the reservation on eBooking. When we arrived, we discovered that the hotel was over booked ! No rooms availables. The hotel tried to make us pay before sending us to another poor and cheap location... We refused. And most of all, the reservation has been cancelled on eBooking : this way, no possibility to leave a comment and share to people. I do not recommand this hotel.",0
3044,"We had booked this hotel 3 months in advance and that too room with balcony, to enjoy our stay being in the center of the city. However to our surprise, when we reached there it turned out to be the worst experience of my life. First of all, we booked hotel pick up service, but the driver could not find us nor did we, because he was holding the name of the hotel as ""Art Inn"". After 5 calls to the hotel, we gave up and asked one person who was roaming around since long with ""Hotel Art Inn"", surprisingly he was our driver. So anyways we reached to the hotel after waiting on the airport for about 45 minutes. After our arrival, they were just delaying our check in by conversation and offering us something to drink etc... When asked if there is a problem, they said everything is in order. After spending almost 20-30 minutes in the waiting area, they started showing us our rooms and there came the biggest shock. They started showing us rooms without balcony and very small too. Also the stairs were scary and from the window you can see nothing. When asked about room with balcony, they started giving excuses and told us that last minute there was some problem and that there is no other room available but these. They offered to reduce the price by EUR10 per room. When we argued with him that it is not acceptable, they started behaving as if we are being unreasonable. Hotel Staff treatment was unacceptable and we decided to leave the hotel and stay anywhere else but in this hotel. They agreed not to charge the payment on our card but they reported to Booking.com that we did not come at all and it shows as ""no show"" status. We received an email next day about charging us for the room but after calling Booking.com it was sorted out.  After coming back I read reviews but the bad experiences were reported only by certain nationality people which shows their discrimination in service.  I would never go back but would urge others too not to go here. There are many other hotels available cheaper than this one and with better hospitality.",0
3294,"Please avoid this hotel. No customer empathy, we landed around 5am and reached hotel at 10am. Asked for early checkin, as per them no rooms were available whereas I checked on website rooms were available. Plus they were asking $150 for early check-in. When asked how rooms are available for early check-in? No answer, looked like order from senior management to charge for early check-in, even if rooms were available. This happened when we booked for 5 nights and emailed for early check-in. My family (with kids) were so sleepy and badly needed the room. Finally paid $100 to get the room early. We don't have control on timings of international flights management should understand that, I saw lot of guests with small kids were sleeping in hospitality area (on seats) but no empathy from hotel staff. Will avoid booking this hotel next time",0

3423,"This hotel was a severe disappointment considering its 4+ star rating on TripAdvisor.  Reasonably clean but a noisy location with lots of street noise. The location is fairly remote but with easy access to Phuket Town via taxi. There are several good restaurants nearby within walking distance.  Hotel staff repeatedly ignored the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign to enter my room and turn off the air conditioner without my approval. Neither the receptionist or the owner appeared to show any concern for my complaints. As an avid scuba diver, I had clothing and equipment laid out to dry in the room's air conditioned, dry air, and several times they entered my room and turned off the system leaving clothes and equipment damp and musty.  What was more infuriating was the receptionist's and owner's complete indifference to my concern and complaints. Apparently, as a guest, I had no right to leave the air conditioning on. I was sworn at and insulted in front of other guests.  They then blamed me for ""breaking"" their key fob - a key fob that had definitely seen many years of use and was already completely worn and abraded. Even though it's not in the guest agreement that you sign at check-in, they will try to 'fine' you 1200 Baht (no receipt issued). What a scam.  Breakfast was included but the ""American Breakfast"" was always either cold or stale as though it had been pre-cooked. The coffee was undrinkable. Stick with the tea - you can't go wrong with hot water and a simple tea bag!  My advice: avoid this place.",0
3476,"What Ovolo HK has done to me is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and IRRATIONAL!!!  So basically what happens is they charged me for 4 nights, but only allowed me to stay for 3 nights, plus WITHOUT refunding me the rest of one night room fee. I thought HK is a law-based society? Isn't this behaviour a daylight robbery? How come they stole a night (900 HKD) from me???",0
3532,"I chose to quarantine here based on reviews, but sadly my experience has been awful. The room is small, the bed is like a rock, the car noise from the road is constant, the food always arrives cold and the answer from staff is the “there are 200 people in the hotel we can’t do anything more…”. Maybe they are taking too many people or don’t have sufficient staff - but the service is dreadful. Very disappointing.",0
3615,"The suite looks nice at photos, but in real life it's very old and needs to be fully reconstructed. Scratched and dirty wallpapers, slippery oiled floor, the door security latch was broken off. The bathroom... oh... too much black mould even for Thailand. When we just checked in someone's hairs were in the bath, the bath itself is good to be thrown out. Nothing else. The shower flow mixer is covered with limescale. It was never cleaned I believe. The waterflow is very poor.   There's a table in the room that I wanted to work at with my laptop. But right above the table there was a hole in the ceil. And water (or whatever it was) was dripping out from there.  Not much but what the hell?  Wifi in the room works extremely bad. Had to buy a local SIM card.  Breakfasts. Though there's quite a good offering of meals, the tea is the problem. 1 (one) sort of tea, if it is tea at all, brewed in a teapot. Ah, there are also 2 dying coffee machines. One of them was broken.  Well, there were good things also. The pool is ok, wide kingsize bed, and the lunch booked to the room from Tropicana restaurant was delicious. But these are to few for a hotel with 8.1 rating at booking.   I do not recommend.",0
3626,"We booked and prepaid in advance and had to get the tourist police involved!  We arrived at 23:30, called in advance around 14:30 to make sure the room was ok for our romantic trip.  The room was a run down version of the dated pictures. The air conditioning did not work and there was a lizard in our room. The room was clearly not checked.  The tried to downgrade us to an worse room without a shower and two single beds. We disagreed. The very unfriendly and aggressive receptionist said that the only person to fix the problem is the manager, who is back tomorrow. And if we don't take the downgraded room they would kick us out. ""Sleep on street, no money back, go"" in a very aggressive tone.  We had to call the police who tried to get us to another hotel but this hotel refused to pay our money back to be able to book somewhere else! The local police advised us to file a complaint in Bangkok with the right authorities.  The hotel agreed with the police that if we stayed one night in the downgraded room they will give us the room we payed for the next day.  It is now 01:00 and we hope we do get the room we paid for.  In my decades of travel, I have never had such an unfriendly and aggressive receptionist and such terrible service.  Stay away from this hotel and if you have no other choice but this hotel then don't prepay as they will try to scam you once they have your money!",0
3816,"Booked a suite room over a month ago.. pictures showed room with an outdoor terrace and seating overlooking the landscape. When I arrived I was taken to my room to find out it was a completely different room right in the back corner of the hotel.. With no view and no terrace just a small walkway.. I was told one of the doors could not be opened as it led to managers area. There was a lounge next to the room but I was told that I could not use it. After checking the pictures I complained that this was not the room I booked and I wanted a room with an outdoor terrace as I had booked. I was then told the room I had booked was under refurbishement ! I had a look around and I said I would swap for a room by the pool. 2 of them were also under refurbishement, the other 2 empty but he said guests would be arriving to take them. The only other room offered was a small side room with no view again! I asked for a refund..which I was given. I wasted taxi money coming all the way there to find out many of the rooms are under refurbishement including the one u had booked. This is terrible service as I booked a month earlier they should have contacted me to let me know that the room wasn't available letting me decide if I still wanted to come before wasting time and money to get to the isolated location. I then asked to be taken back to ubud.. I had to wait a further 3 hours for the free shuttle bus as they wouldn't organise a taxi for me unless I paid $30. Overshadowed terrible service be warned!",0
3900,"Beware when showering, the sewage piping in the hotel room needs upgrading! My room had extremely poor drainage; it flooded the floor until the main corridor, and wouldn’t stop flowing. When the housekeeping staff came, both persons were rude, highly defensive and continually pinned the problem on us. We finally got our room changed by a burly man with glasses at the front desk. However, he was equally insensitive and unapologetic for our inconvenience and he had a take-it-or-leave attitude. Highly disappointed in the treatment of guests by the staff. I wouldn’t recommend staying here, as the service here is a far cry from other hotels nearby this area.",0
3927,"The hotel was disappointing, I paid for a double room and got two separate beds, one of which was broken, dipped in the middle and was very uncomfy. No hangers or iron in the room. We booked the spa for an hour on Tuesday for Friday morning and when we went to go in the spa they told us we couldn’t go in as something wasn’t working, we had no notice at all for it. Asked them to book us a taxi to the city centre which cost €40 when the past few days it had cost us €20 at most.",0
4006,"Place is overall terrible for the price you pay. Picked this hotel for the good reviews and now I know for a fact they are paid reviews or just scammers. This place is just all around dumpy and old. The infrastructure is awful, the rooms are not only small but are shaped very weird, many fire code violations, and the bathrooms are ridiculous. No curtain or door for the bathroom so the water just spills onto the bathroom floor, just plain gross. The hallways are loud and echoey so you hear everything in your room! Location is very far from sights. 20 minute walk to bus station for airport, and 15 minute walk for Acropolis. There are no taxis that drive by the area they are located in. They really need to update this place or charge a lower price. Not worth 80 Euros a night.",0
4074,"We booked a room just for day use to change before our long flight home. Staff very unfriendly and incompetent. We ordered room service for two, arriving two plates with only one cutlet. Ordering the second one, the knife was missing. Although ordering in advance, waiting time. We ordered starters, one of them Not available…. We stayed for the whole stay in LEELA Hotels and have been very happy in Delhi, Jaipur and Kovalam, but Chennai never ever again !!!! Even pick up from the airport only medium friendly…",0
4196,"I would not recommend this hotel for the following reasons: (a) The decoration is very old and lack of renovation. It's a reminiscence of 80s or 90s in China. (b) The power outlet is UK style!! I understand that this hotel was built by a Singapore company but come on, it's 2019 not 1989. Why do you still keep UK style power outlet but not Chinese or US one?? (c) The carpet seems old and not quite clean. To be honest, there are not many options if you want to stay in old town Suzhou but you do have many other options outside. I don't see the necessity to stay in old town right?",0
4201,"Yuck.  We were here with our tour group of 23 for one ridiculous evening.  The building has some impressive lobbys and that is it.   Once we entered the long maze to our room, the grandeur was replaced with motel level ambience. Our room was a dingy 3 level star at best.  The carpet was old, stained, and had not been vacuumed.  The chair at the desk was ripped and missing part of the seat.  The bathroom was tired but had lovely soap products.  Our neighbor’s room had a dildo left behind from the previous Guests waiting for them.  Ew.  We wondered other then making the beds, the rooms are cleaned at all in between people.   The dinner had been reserved and ordered the day before.   Nevertheless, the food took ages and came out at different times.  We have 6 people in our family and the notion of serving us together was a hassle.  Instead three cold plates of beef came right away.  The other 3 orders came at 30 min or longer to appear. All cold.  Other guests experienced similar frustrations and worse.   Appently the food was made earlier and just dishes out cold.   The table beside us had a dish that was literally still frozen when it came to the table.  The table beside us was broken.  We cleared our own table while waiting for desert.  Staff were kind but confused as through 20 were just hired that day.      Thankfully we all laughed at the craziness of this experience.  If it wasn’t called Pan Pacific it wouldn’t have bothered us.  Just part of discovering China.",0
4206,"It was fortunate that they preserved the exterior of the hotel. But the people who bought the hotel and renovated it mustnt have thought about the layout of the hotel because it was a disaster. It was confusing going around the hotel and finding our way to certain places. A couple of our family members took 20 minutes to get from their hotel room to the breakfast buffet restaurant. The staff didnt even speak much English so they were on their own.   The buffet breakfast place was dirty. On a Sunday, my husband waited 30 minutes in line just to get an omelette. If they’ve already anticipated for a full house on weekends, they shouldve positioned 2-3 omelette stations.   The floor of the buffet area was dirty too — spilled drinks were left on the floor. No one had time to mop them.   Even the waiters could not keep up with the volume of people coming in the restaurant. We were shown to a table where only the plates and utensils were cleared, but the placemats and table cloth (with spilled juice) were left unchanged. We had to demand to get them changed.    If the staff could not speak English, i do not blame them. But if their service is terrible because they were lazy, then that’s something we have to complain about. We had dinner at one of their restaurants. We ordered a mix of Chinese and Western cuisine such as laksa soup, Hainan chicken rice, margarita pizza, and carbonara pasta. Chinese food were served first. But it took them 30 mins to serve the pizza and pasta. We also requested for second round of water for the entire group, but it did not come. We found the waitress that we asked water from, to be texting near the counter. Everything about this hotel was disappointing.   ",0
4218,"We recently stayed at this hotel for two nights 17 and 18 September as part of the Luxury Escapes Tour of China.  The hotel is very tired and is in need of a facelift.  The shower leaked and there was no fridge in the room.  We were on the 1st floor but had to take the lift to the 3rd floor, cross the lobby, walk down an enclosed walkway then catch the lift to the first floor.  Then it was another trek to get to our room.  EVERYONE, and I mean everyone, on our tour got lost!  It certainly is NOT a luxury hotel.  The one redeeming factor was the gardens at the rear of the hotel.",0
4261,"The ground floor room extremely cramped and uncomfortable. It had one desk chair but no room for two so nowhere comfortable to sit. There was barely room to walk around the bed. No food was available, in the end we ate in the hospital cafés!  Would avoid in future. ",0
4290,"Pre booked room with walk in shower as disabled. On arrival receptionist with attitude said ""that room is not available"" showed her the conformation on phone response was ""what do you expect me to do about it"" and we were directed to a box room.  If you have any sense go to a TravelLodge or Premier Inn This place is truly the pits. ",0
4307,"Un professional, amateurish staff they do not know the meaning of hospitality. A simple mobile charger went missing from my room and  I was accused of lying and making up the story.The housekeeping is made up of foreign nationals with no idea of customer relations they are just there to get paid coffee beans. Rude and arrogant to say the least especially the housekeeper. Hotel Manager of the same character not even bothering to meet me and explain the situation. A cesspit is 5 star compared to this barrack. i reported this attitude to Hotels.com staff which they tried to solve the situation, but they also were given the cold shoulder.",0
4341,Unfortunately the location was in a very rough area and very far from central London. Rooms where not too bad. Was relatively clean however it looked more like a hostel. Would not go again. At £80 a night was extremely disappointing.,0
4347,"The place is dirty the staff are unhelpful to the point of rude. We had a 3 day stay in June 2018 Due to a Funeral and this is close, we booked as it is part of the Hospital and should be good and clean as we suspect it is used by people that are there for sick and dying relatives, the breakfast continental so a bit of a joke £5.99 the hotel charge £282 for 3 nights (no breakfast) so that is the room cost. I will post some phots of the filthy state of the bed and the shower. I raised the issues with the staff and the only offer we were given was a free night. The noise outside the rooms keep you awake at night. Who in there right mind would want to stay any longer than is necessary. This hotel has a captive audience as part of the Hospital. There photos on line look like they have been photo-shopped. This is as we saw it and would never go back. Spoke to the manager when we got home as not available when we were there. His comment was do what you got to do and hung up on us.",0
4701,"A terrible hotel. Terrible staff and terrible food. All staff members other than evening time bar staff were so rude and no help what so ever.

Disgusting. If I could rate this hotel 0 star I would.",0

5052,I could not believe how rude they were. Every time i spoke to them it ruined my day.DO. NOT VISIT this hotel. And it happened to me even though i stayed in Shilla hotel's   suite room. I can still remember condescending tone every staff members had. i ususally dont write reviews but i really want no one to feel bad as i feel on their trip to Seoul,0
5062,"I stayed for a day in Shilla Seoul because I was transiting Korea for few days and I have chosen Shilla because it was a fine hotel option from Amex travel website.  First of all they were very courteous and attentive which was not bad but the problem happened mostly with car parking and exit. I have pulled out my car from the car park and stopped at the reception because my family were inside so I had to pick them up. It was early in the morning and there were only 2 or 3 cars but this guy (not sure whether he is a parking clerk or bell boy) was very forcefull and saying to me you need to make your car to move ahead little bit and leave your car key inside.  I couldn't really understand this part at all because my family were standing next to the car and I just had to grab them and go but this car parking assistant was very intimidating and forceful so we had a little argument after I got out of my car.   I felt pretty overwhelemd at this point because why is he try to have this much verbal fight with the customer? I understand it could be busy after lunch hours and he may needs to stick to his rules but I never had this treatment when I was using my car in any other hotels in the US.   but the biggest problem was when I was trying to check out.   I was doing late check out at 2 pm and I had to grab my car and go to the airport to catch my flight coming back to NY. But I found this hotel is completely packed on weekend and their parking system is total mess. I'm an Korean American so I'm able to understand the language but if you don't speak Korean, don't even think about renting a car and park in this hotel.  You'll be completely lost and don't know what to do. Even worse I had to wait for 25 minutes to get my car from the valet and it could have been little bit risky because I had to catch my flight at 7 pm. I made it through the process but this hotel is very much for the domestic resident who wants to enjoy weekend at the hotel but it is not the hotel for the people from overseas.",0
5234,The room was not properly cleaned. The room smelled odd. The guest in the room above me bumped all night and guest that had dogs on our floor pet kept barking. Sheets had a stain and my pillow cases as well,0
5384,Inappropriate and unprofessional! I booked to the hotel through their website and on arrival was told I could not be accommodated for the entire length of stay. I was left to stay in the lobby after a 5 hour trip to look for alternate accommodation in another hotel!,0
5511,"Holiday Inn at Harare is just a medium class hotel but here you pay 3x more than the same type of hotel in Europe. For 1 night including dinner payed a ridiculous amount of 170 american dollars. It is an hotel for corporate people that the companies pays for their stay... if you go on your own you just get ripped off for a standard hotel. The room is basic, the appliances of the toilet are old fashion (same as granny's house), it doesn't even has a hair drier or a kit of tooth brush. When sitting at the sofa you sink in it. The AC is at the floor of the room pointing to a desk and after a while of work is just blowing wind. That night a water pipe burst so in the morning had no water for shower and the lifts weren't working. Had to use the stairs down to the lobby with such poor signs that I ended up in a AVAC room instead of reaching the lobby for breakfast. Than after breakfast up the stair till the 7th floor to pack my bags. At dinner the meat was hard and over cooked and waited for a drink at already half the meal. At breakfast the eggs and bacon was already fried and just sitting there when they have a chef that could do them on the spot for the client. That's how it should be for the price that you are paying. At the end I had a club sandwich and a soda tab of 11 dollars to pay and if it was a management with manners they should say that the bill it would be on our account to compensate the costumer and sorry for the inconvenience that we caused on your stay. That's how things should work with proper management. ",0

The cleaning is far than acceptable. I asked at the reception to write in the book guest - they don't have and they are not interest to know what is wrong in their facility, so.... They treated us bad, distinctly of the other guests, only because we are Romanian. Very bad services!",0

If you don't like sleeping with a double duvet, then don't rent this room... they only have one duvet pr. room, we had to sleep with a brown weirdly smelling blanket.  6. One member of staff was nice, the rest was down right rude.  7. You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the WHOLE building! 8. You are not allowed to keep your keyes when you leave the hotel? 9. Remember the 2 euro pr night pr person for staying there which is called city tax? which has to be paied in cash? Shady....   All in all, do not waste your money.

After looking at the website and booked directly for a stay 1/27-29/2022 for 2.  However, my husband had unexpected surgery late on 2/26 and could not accompany me.  When I checked in on 2/27/22 I informed the representative that I had an unexpected family issue and that I needed to change my stay to 1 person and needed to leave on 1/28/22.  She said that because I used 'another party' to book the reservation i needed to contact 800-259-2091 to request a refund - that she was unable to process.   I called the 800 number and due to a very long wait time I chose the ""text feature"" to share my issue.  Via text feature, I twice  provided the information requested but received NO Response.

6871,"Been in HK many times, thinking we would try something more ‘local and different’ and, stay in somewhere other than the usual areas.  We booked a private double bedroom with en-suite (26th March), which is the same prices as most mid-range hotels in HK.  Pros: Heritage building built in the 50’s. Clean room and common areas. Local feel.  Cons: 1) DREADFUL RECEPTIONIST: we were checked-in by Mandy who was unwelcoming, unprofessional, full of bad attitude and perfunctory. This sort of service gives Hong Kong’s hospitality industry a bad name. Yes, this is a ‘hostel’ but it doesn’t mean it needs to be ‘hostile’ and rude. She almost made us felt that she was doing us a favour by giving us a room! Other receptionists I dealt with, seemed much better. This is the typical case which one member of the team can dent the good work of other members. 2) Hostel facilities but not hostel prices. 3) The private double bedroom is just 2 mattress push together. Bed is rock hard. 4) Poor amenities in room, everything is at extra cost, even to change a towel, costs!  5) Forget about the breakfast! One of the worst breakfasts we have ever had. Don’t know why the bother?! Just go around the corner and plenty of cafes offer decent food.  I do not recommend this place other than if you want to stay in their dormitory and go rough.",0

I prepaid for 8 nights at the hostel and I managed to last 3 nights , it was fully booked hostel and the girls in the room were extremely rude , being very loud , playing music , talking at 1am - 6am in morning, they didn't care if they woke you , brought in smelly food stunk out the room.   i complained to the staff and not once did they try and speak to anyone in the room to be quiet. Obviously after 3 nights of no sleep I had to check out of my 8 night stay and told them as to why I'm leaving , they said "" oh you sometimes get unlucky and get noisy guests"" I asked for a refund for the remaining nights I'm not staying a knew they would sell my bunk to another guest , and they told me to sort it via booking.com   Upton my return from travels , were they fair and gave me a refund for my 5 nights I didn't stay ? Even though it a full hostel and my bed would of been sold to someone else yet again making more money ? ....No I didn't get a refund !   In the end I paid for a lovely hotel costing £450 for the remaining 5 nights ! Please anyone please do not stay here if you want safety , security and also a good nights rest , your complaints will get ignored and they will not be fair to you if you leave due to noise and disruption! I really didn't want to pay extra for a hotel  as couldn't afford it  and needed to borrow money off my parents , but that's how seriously bad this place was !!! PLEASE BE WARNED !

Or no cutlery in the hotel maybe they could say no instead making guest wait for nothing  Breakfast the one in the desk who’s making all the guests seat says we can’t entire as we are not on proper attire,   She seems to be a supervisor and send us away, we came back proper attire according to her and she keep watching us every single movement we do;  She even gossip to other staff about us and make fun of us even if we wear face mask we could tell by the eye of everyone, and she gave us the main seat of entrance so she could keep an eye on us she asked every guest that enter if they want coffee juice for us no nothing!  I wonder if we enter without face mask she would send us away but for same people like her she’s nice and polite to us probably because we are others for her she treat us so oddly   My partner doesn’t even want to order coffee as his scared for what treatment he will receive for others by listening and observing she’s very entertaining the way that supervisor/ team leader says oh not a problem followed by question any preference for milk? For my partner wont be to long! No nothing to offer of any options  Whenever you stand to get food she will follow you by staring at you make you feel so small upon your self and feels like you want to leave and just don’t eat if i knew it will be like this I won’t pay extra for breakfast be included I wasn’t aware that specific people race, colour, ethnicity, culture, and who knows allergies or religion eating there feels like you don’t want to eat and just end as soon as you can; you could have breakfast for normal treatment like your not paying and seems like your thief stranger and dangerous person!  I worked as ambassador as well for Sofitel Fiji and Melbourne this isn’t what we are oriented to treat our dearest guests I stayed at Mercure melbourne and pullman on Albert back in Melbourne this wasn’t the treatment I get, this is a 4 star hotel Mercure is 3 star but breakfast and service is amazing! And pullman’s stay was incredible! I had discount before as staff here i paid as normal person but this was unforgettable moment as it is TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE!  Im working decently we paid and most of all I personally even upgraded our room for a night to stay to make it MEMORABLE NOT HORRIBLE!  The restaurant staffs entertain everyone except us!  I ordered omelette to the chef politely for egg white omelette to the chef directly as no body wanted us there but chef gave normal omelette when he bring it out i said chef I asked for egg white omelette he said place your order to the counter so I did   I waited my for order I explained 3 times and it came out normal omelette that time isn’t busy yet at the buffet im chef and i know how it looks like even if your not a chef you know the color differences   Glad Mr. Eric Le made our Sydney trip made it somehow special and no racism involved thank you for being kind greeting us in the morning! Before heading back for a long drive to Melbourne   Other than that our experience for the price we paid for is not worth it at all! Very upsetting and will never recommend;",0

I requested and refund and was promptly charged full booking fee AGAIN (TWICE) instead of refund. It has been 3 business days and I am still trying to get my double charge back.  Response from the hotel:  poorly written emails with meaningless suggestions to ""wait"" up to 7 business days (for local bank transfer, really???), helpless Chinese staff on the phone not even willing to contact their bank to see what's holding up my refund.  The result to date: an unexpected hole in my budget from double charge and murky perspective of a booking refund. Stupidity and unprofessionalism.",0
7448,"I booked 4 nights here (relying on Trip Advisor reviews and info from calling hotel Challis). King room with balcony - $249 a night. We drove up to the hotel and there is no place to pull over to check in and bring in luggage. There is rarely any parking spots on the street. We stopped and held up traffic - other cars were not amused. There are numerous steps up to reception (no ramp). Another guest helped me get my luggage up while my husband circled the block numerous times in search of parking. Prior to booking, I called the hotel to make sure they have a lift as my husband and I have difficulty with steps. They assured me they had a lift and steps would be no problem. They have a lift but the room floors are not on the same level as the lift. We had to walk up about 8 steps to get to the room. The hotel also assured me that parking is available a short distance away. After struggling and getting our luggage in our room (and finding the Air condition didn’t work), we drove to the “nearby “ parking garage. Parking is no where near the hotel. My husband couldn’t make the walk so we went back and checked out. Maybe an hour had passed since check in. They charged me $249 anyway. We found much better accommodations at Meriton Suites on Kent street for that night and the remainder of our stay in Sydney. There are numerous good accommodations in Sydney. Hotel Challis isn’t one of them. ",0

We couldn't even get our bathing suits or towels to dry. Our room smelled so bad all the time, like a wet smelling socks, starting the moment we enter our room. Our room was dirty, stains and dirt everywhere. The breakfast was so bad, food wasnt fresh, no place to sit because they didn’t have enough tables or chairs. They didn’t even have enough plates or any dishes. Food runned out fast and all guests didn’t get to eat.  ONLY good thing was the location, near metro station.

Under the bed was filthy with dirt and dust looked like it had been forgotten about by the cleaner. - Bed sheets were filled with dust when we asked boy (saying no staff only 1 in the floor) if we could have them changed he replied: ""well the cleaner has finished. very bad ...whos going to do it?"" - Fridge was dirty and horrible and the bottom of it was rusty. - Staff funny when you leave hotel to eat or drink out. I could go on but out going to waste any more time. I have honestly never been anywhere and met such rude staff in the desk.

After numerous attempts to contact the hotel by emailing with no response, we cancelled the reservation and booked elsewhere, down the street.

We walked into the hotel lobby a few days ago and we were unsure we were in the right hotel. When an older white haired man approached I said hello and asked if we were in the right hotel. His response was, ""Can you read?"" I was shocked. I did not know if he was joking or not. I found out he was not joking when he proceeded to barrage us and tell us that we needed to ask him the question again and phrased how he wanted it asked. What?? Then he continued by stating, ""In France education comes first, not like in America"". Never will I stay here.",0
7993,"Stayed here three years ago and loved the hotel, location and staff. This visit I noted a completely different staff and who appeared indifferent to the guests. As reported on in other  Trip Advisor reviews the air conditioning was not working and, since the unit was on ground floor, opening a window was not an option due to street noise and the risk of an unwanted quest. Complaints to the staff was met with indifference as the air conditioner was not repaired during out four night stay. There are several other hotels in this area and will not say at this hotel again.",0

Unable to charge phone from bed closest to window. - Extremely loud , was offered only a room facing a wall as an alternative. - Single , slow escalator.  For this price range there are a myriad of superior options in the area and I would advise finding lodging elsewhere.",0

Next morning I went on my business. Never saw the Kindle again, gone with many personal documents and being unlocked. I kept calling the hotel over the next 10 days since I am still in Japan. The Kindle was never found (see arched under the bed, etc.). Whoever did my room must have either tossed it away, or appropriated it. Either way, I can't believe this has happened in Japan. I have been coming here for over a decade, and lived here too.",0

8657,Havnt state here this trip yet but had two seperate bookings that I had to cancel as airline changed flight dates. I cancelled both bookings online and rebooked to fit I. With new schedule. Cancelled bookings had a cancellation refund policy if cancelled 3 days prior to arrival date which for me is June.  After a month and no refund I followed up via email to be informed that they would now cancel the bookings and I was eligible for refund under terms of booking and that refunds take four weeks. This is droit me providing them with their own cancellation reference and date that system generated cancellation. This means eight weeks for a refund which is excessive. I replied to their email over a week ago stating the above and still no reply. I am now in the process of cancelling my other bookings with them to stay with IHG.  Lousy service,0

As I it was non-refundable rate the other hotel charged the money for the room on the next day, April, 10. More than in a month, at the end of May I received the email with confirmation from La Casa Gran Barcelona. At the same day I was charged non-refundable rate.

We waited over two hours to get access to our room, the place was so chaotic as many guests weren't able to get access to their room and the staff didn't handle the situation well at all. They'd had a huge event the night before with lots of guests staying. They were struggling to turn the rooms around. Some guests we spoke to waited til after 6pm before they were given access to their rooms. The restaurants were slow, we actually left one after waiting over 20 mins to get a menu, and then another 20 mins went by and no one came to take our order. Our room was okay but the armchairs were horribly stained, we didn't want to sit in them. Very poor experience overall, wouldn't recommend at all.",0

9830,"It’s hard to know where to begin with this awful story.  My sister who was getting married in Istanbul booked this hotel for the night of her wedding (wedding venue was elsewhere nearby) and for a couple of nights after as a mini moon. My sister did a lot of research into the best hotels in the area as she wanted something special for her special day. When she found this hotel she sent me pictures all excited saying that this is where she wanted to stay. She booked the hotel 8 MONTHS in advance (this is relevant later).   5 days before the wedding we were driving past the hotel and my sister and her fiancé said let us show you where we are staying. We stopped by reception, paid one nights deposit and the gentleman on reception showed us the room that they would be staying in. It was right on the water, spacious and everything they expected it would be. The receptionist even said that as they were a honeymoon couple they would be given extra treats. We explained that on the day of the wedding there would be three girls plus the bride getting their hair done as the hair dresser was coming to the hotel. The receptionist said this was fine and not a problem at all.  Well, on Wednesday my sister and her fiancé were having their photo shoot done and whilst my sister was having her hair done her fiancé told me that there was a problem with the hotel as they had overbooked and were offering an alternative for them in the attic. We drove over immediately and they receptionist told us that there had been a mistake and that they had oversold the room. I asked why they were not moving the other people as I doubt that they too were a honeymoon couple and he said it was because they booked before my sister did. Of course, they must have booked a year before!!   After a whole load of lies about what happened with the booking it became quite clear to me that they were able to offer the room to someone else at a higher rate. Either that or someone they knew wanted the room. After 15 -20 minutes of debate we asked to see the manager. The manager too gave us the same lies that someone else booked in advance and then when this didn’t work he tried to say that he was doing is a favour as the other rooms he could offer were more quiet as they were not on the main floor. He didn’t add that they were dark and dingy of course. After 45-60 mins of insisting we finally got the room they initially promised to us. On the day of the wedding the receptionist forgot that we had a hairdresser coming and kept him waiting because he didn’t know my sisters name.   Needless to say this hotel caused my sister, my brother in law and I a great deal of stress. They were a bunch of cold, rude chancers. One of the most appealing treatments i have ever experienced in a hotel.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. Awful. Just awful behaviour which is a shame as the hotel itself is lovely.",0
10080,We booked a room because it's listed as a 4 star hotel.  First 10 minutes walking around on the floor my husband noticed my feet were suddenly BLACK on the bottem.  I clean them and walked around for another 15 minutes and the same thing happened. I found dust balls everywhere and the floor obviously had not been clean in some time. I do not recommend this hotel to ANYONE.  It is FILTHY. My husband head the front desk tell someone if there were no parking spots left it was okay to park at the bank lot next door. HOWEVER the sign on the pole stated anyone parking in the lot that was not a customer of that bank could get Towed.  We are never going back there again.,0

10138,"The room we had was the economy twin, the beds were rather sub par. My bed felt like it sloped off in one direction. Our room had no airconditioning, this made the room unbearably hot and with no real ventilation and high temperatures, sleeping was an ordeal, the space was tiny compared to cheaper or similarly priced hotels we stayed in during our time in Prague. Due to unfortunate circumstances back home we had to leave within 24 hours of our check in time, the employee at the front desk told us that it would be possible to leave and receive a refund. Several weeks later we have yet to receive our money back or get anything in the form of an update regarding our refund. The people at the front desk have no way to contact management, or so they claim. The only form of contact available is through email, to which they responded in the beginning, but have since failed to respond to any of our follow up emails.  If you want a decent accommodation for the same price we paid, look for a hotel.  Another think that was irksome was that they ad a bar in the basement of the hostel that closed rather early, it was advertised to be open from ""7 until (at least) midnight"", as per their website, they closed the bar a little after ten because they apparently didn't have enough people in the bar.  All in all, if you want to go cheap go for the hostel experience and don't get a private room, they aren't worth it.",0

We were already on the 8th floor of the hotel and the noise was so loud so can’t imagine how it was on the party floor. Last night was unforgettable, beyond disgusting, disrespectful and unforgivable! I can’t believe that the hotel subjected us and their other guests to very loud, heart-pounding music.  Our short staycation became very stressful and we got WOUND UP INSTEAD OF WINDING DOWN! What a shame! Never patronizing this hotel again, ever.",0

If you want hot water , you have to go to level 2. So in the end we buy thermos water bottle just because want to keep hot water in room.  2. bathroom water cant go out. Can imaging the weather so cold and we wake up in the morning go toilet , we have to step on the cold water then can go toilet. i ask the counter staff, they say all rooms it like that. Really worst of it. In the end they give 2 towel to put at the floor. Only become step on cold towel instead cold water. Doesnt help much at all.  3. Their level 2 cant have outside food , the staff say because they have sell food. First time i heard cant bring outside food to hotel rest level.  4. Double windows rooms only have 7rooms in CitizenM Taipei Please note they have 200++rooms and only have 7 rooms for double windows. I have booked for 6 nights and have ask them help to check and arrange for us at least one night for the double window rooms to gain the experience. But their staff dun have help heart to check and just say they have 200++ rooms and only have 7 rooms. They cant do it. I booked so many night , even just ask for 1 night double window rooms also cant.  Good thing is they very near North gate mrt link with airport mrt. So is convenience for tourist.

10594,"No breakfast, no pool, no amenities of any kind. Restaurant moved into the Hilton next door but still advertise inside BW. Staff are like cold robots with no personality. No drain plug for tub. Plus I was overcharged and had to get that corrected. Don’t waste your time here",0
10598,"After being assured just two days before arrival that having the two rooms on the same floor would be no problem, we arrived to find that they had NOT done as requested. We had to wait while they figured out if there was a room available on the same floor. Valet was slow and rude. Pillows were lumpy and hard. Lights flickered when turned on. NO soundproofing. You hear EVERYTHING--street noise, people in the hall, and the room next door. Not sure what is up with the area, but at 10:30pm and 1:30am all three nights we stayed there were people yelling and singing in the streets with loud music. Only 2 small elevators (about 4 people fit, not counting luggage). Second elevator was broken on our last day. That means 9 floors were sharing one tiny elevator. Staff was cordial, but not very helpful unless you know what to ask. They didn't inform us about their covid policies, so we were surprised when they didn't clean the rooms the second day there. They did send up extra towels for us though when I asked. Ice machines only on even numbered floors. The location is good, but I advise choosing a newer hotel with proper soundproofing and bigger elevators. We barely fit the luggage cart in the elevator with us.",0
10599,This stay was the worst of the worst the night shift manager or whatever she was she worked the front desk with short hair she was very rude and disrespectful cussing and threatening to put me and my family out  stating we had a noise complaint but it was impossible because we were laying down going to sleep  ; but yet my room and the hall way was smelling like marijuana due to the room next door to me and i complained about that but She didn’t care,0
10600,"Room was dirty, trash left from previous guest, no towels, dusty. Lobby smelled horrible. Took 30mins to check in. Elevator had trash in it. Lady at front desk had an attitude when I came to ask her towels because we didn’t have any in room. Wouldn’t recommend this hotel if it was $1 a night",0
10605,"The outer walls here are not walls, they are single glass and metal panes with NO noise protection from the street whatsoever. (I have no idea how they keep the place heated in winter.) The sound of motorcycles revving their engines all night was absolutely intolerable. Additionally, the walls inside are paper thin and we had a screaming baby in the next room. I think we each got 2 or 3 hours of sleep max - completely ruined our next day and our trip. Do NOT stay here!!!!",0

10626,"This is, by far, the worst service and accommodations that we have ever experienced during our trips to South beach. We Normally stay at Sagamore to accommodate a family of 5. The hotel itself is in shambles. Problems with our 2 bedroom townhouse listed below. 1. Our king mattress literally had a 6"" depression/hole in the middle. 2. No hot water in upstairs shower rendering it useless. 3. Had to operate both showers with our fingers and the metal stem that was supposed to have a handle attached.  4. Disposal in kitchen non-functioning and clogged. 5. Downstairs shower, no handle.  6. Leaks evident throughout structure with collection containers for wastewater in multiple locations. 7. Dirty linens and public area seating. 8.Antagonistic and unfriendly service in pool area. 9..Must walk all the way to front desk from room to get ice. 400 yes approximately. 10. Unfriendly staff at pool, bar, restaurant and front desk. 11. I have stayed at Days Inn in a bind on the road for business travel that would put this property to shame. 12. C grade movie being shot on location which restricted use of public spaces on multiple days.",0

When I called to complain the manager was rude and dismissive, forgot all my expensive missions swimsuits at the room and when called to ask for them they said they’d threw them away.

10758,まず英語が話せない、理解できないスタッフが多く、外国人相手に向かってヘラヘラ笑ってごまかそうとする。フロントはアルバイトかと疑ってしまうレベルの対応で、こちらは高額な宿泊費を支払っているにもかかわらず、その対価が得られない。こちらの言うことを無視して言い返してくる対応で、頭に来たのでさらにこちらが不満を申し上げると露骨に嫌な顔をされる始末。二度とお世話になりたくない、四つ星とはとても思えない最低サービスのホテル。The service of this hotel was quite bad for foreigners and they cannot understand English and didn't even try to listen properly. It is not worth to stay here for non-Japanese users.,0
10762,We flew in overnight after long haul flight with aged parents over 70yrs old and I did request before arrival for early check in for obvious reason. Regardless how many times you explained the situation all they did was asking 50% additional for 2 hours early check in although the room was apparently available. Everywhere you go you don’t see this type of money craving mindset ...would never never recommend. ,0
10790,A hair dryer was not working last year. A refrigerator was out of service this month and they replaced the other one after request but we could not use it because of the nasty smell and dirty condition. They have so much high rate for the weekend (25000). They always copy your passport on every single booking day. They only live because of the skytree view. No one can speak English when I ckeck out. Sorry.. skytree is not interested in to me any more. You can see it everywhere. Find out other hotels..,0
11065,"I booked through Booking.com and noticed the day before my stay that one night's accommodation (£87) had been taken from my account.  When I checked in, I was advised that the full amount was payable and that the £87 would not be deducted.  On the day we were leaving, I advised that the £87 was still showing as pending and was told this would be removed.  After a week, it was still showing as pending and I was told that it could take up to 3 weeks (!) for this to be removed.  It is now nearly 4 weeks and it is still showing as pending.   As my bank takes into account pending transactions when calculating my balance, I cannot take any money from my account.  I emailed again yesterday but nobody has responded.  I also emailed the manager this morning but haven't had a reply.  I called the hotel back again just now and was advised that they would transfer me... but then they hung up on me. So I am left unable to get any money out of my account to pay for food and transport... and the Montana Hotel are not responding to my requests for help. Have no idea what else to do.",0

11315,It is in a handy location but the hotel itself has very tired rooms with very very small windows and very noisy plumbing. The heating was erratic and when we came back in on Sunday the cleaner had turned the heating off...it took hours to heat it again ,0
11344,45 minutes after the table reservation time we were taken from the bar to the restaurant.  Bare table - not even laid.  Orders had already been taken at the bar because we had waited so long for our booked table. No drinks order was taken at all for the entire meal. Had to get our own water carafe and glasses. No dessert order taken. Staff were friendly but the hotel could have made a lot more money than they did. ,0
11381,I rang and booked because we have a 6 month old daughter I needed a bigger room. I was given a tiny room not big enough to have our own personal small bassinet beside the bed on the 13th floor with a king bed. The bed was tiny I went to reception and stated it wasn’t a king bed to be told ‘it’s a hotel king bed’ I was then taken to floor 5 to a bigger room and was told the room/ 5th floor are for ‘disabled’ people it was bigger but not with the price I paid.,0

They searched 10 x the same spot although I told them it is gone. Rather in a room or with another guests outside. Only when I insisted to check the cameras, they did and found out that they gave our luggage with all documents to other guests! (the luggage was stored together, on top of each other, don't know how someone can split that up) No apology, no refund, no damage compensation - just nothing! ",0

Also prices can be different given by different receptionists. (I came around 18:00 and price was given 6900 RUB, later my colleague came at 21:00 and after arguing got a price 5200 RUB) - Unprofessional staff. Except one girl (before she was working in Ritz Carlton) noone knows what to do. When I asked to extend my stay she told that she needs to check me out and then check me in. When I started to argue she accepted to extend. - I put DND card, but HK cleaned my room. - Breakfasts are expencive but there is no choice. - Bar is closing after 00:00 and staff is sending you to another hotel of the chain (better was to stay there). - Rooms are sooo small that if you open the bathroom door you cannot go out of the room. Instead of wardrobe there is 15 cm space with 4 hangers. I felt like inside the carriage.  Not worth to stay here.",0

12704,"We didn't stay in the hotel but we tried business lunch in Ibis Kitchen.  It's not my first visit to Ibis hotel and Ibis Kitchen, so it's easy to compare.  The service was soooooooo slowwwwwwww for business lunch.  The stuff doesn't know menu (though there were only about 5 dishes for lunch). By the way, there are spelling mistakes. You should hire someone who knows Russian!!!  It seemed to me that there is a la carte menu, but noone offered it to us.   So it took about 20 minutes to bring drinks, than we waited more to have salad. It was strange for me, that the same 2 salads for 2 guests together were served not in the same time... But the the same was with the main courses. So may be it's  the hotel's innovation:)  20 minutes passed after we finished eating and before we had the bill.  No manager supervised the work of stuff and tried to improve the situation.  I guest this service has nothing in common with Ibis standards... :((((",0
12714,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I had an intrusion on the FIRST night of my staying and got traumatized! ! Booked a one-bedroom from April 14th to 18th. Around 2:30 am on the first night, a security guy entered my bedroom, switched on the light, and told me that the room was supposed to be vacant and I should not be there. I was sleeping deeply and totally freaked out when I saw him in the room. It turned out that the front desk double-booked my room and gave my room to another person. Then I did NOT get any apology from the front desk or the security guy. After this incident, I was so scared in the room and had to block the door with a chair to sleep. After another night, I decided to check out early as just could not sleep due to safety concerns. I talked with their front desk manager and asked for a refund for the nights that I did not use. He told me that he could not make any decisions on the refund and he had to ask the general manager and then get back to me on Monday. After that, no response from them whatsoever. I have been calling Booking.com all day long and Booking.com also told me no response from them. So I got offended at the hotel and paid $500 for it!! The worst part was that the incident traumatized me and totally ruined my vacation! Now I am speaking with an attorney to file a lawsuit. Besides that, the room was dirty and smelly. Found cockroaches in the drawers and closets. They also charge higher resort fees so not cheap as you would expect.",0
12732,"This is a horrible hotel on all accounts. The photos show the same furniture but it is severely run down and very dirty. We had small bugs hanging(!) from the walls and they fumigated it, but didn’t clean it. We had a lizard under our sofa. We asked for the room to be cleaned and it took two days. No hair dryer, no tissue.  Our view was three old disgusting mattresses outside.  The AC in one of the rooms didn’t work. The other ones were so loud you had to shout to each other. Last night we killed the biggest cock roach I ever saw - over 5 cm long. This was the last four nights of our trip and I don’t think I have ever been as disappointed in a hotel since I was back packing. Don’t go here. It is plainly awful.",0

When we walked to our room we saw several guests consuming marijuana, including our rowdy neighbors. We felt very unsafe. 2-hours later we checked-out and left the hotel, after being offered a refund for the excess paid over the 1-night non-refundable fee. When I followed-up on my refund the hotel argued first that we had in fact stayed for the whole reservation. After proven wrong, they argued that my fee was non-refundable in contradiction to their own policy written on my reservation email. Will file a complaint with the Miami-Dade Consumer Protection Office. Stay away!",0

13196,"After a late night arrival, I was surprised to find the hotel condition quite dated and facilities reminded me of a typical motel room in US.  Location was convenient to business meetings and located next to a brand new 500m iconic Lotte Tower.  Relative to price, I was rather disappointed with the dated facility especially the bathroom and the Executive Lounge located on the 28th floor had minimal selections for breakfast and very limited service.  Staff did not even offer tea or coffee for breakfast; expecting self service all the way.  There was a setup for trying eggs that was not staffed and seemed like a self service counter to fry your own eggs and omelette.  Seems strange, even though the view from the room to the background greenery and hills were impressive.  Perhaps the shopping is a highlight in the mall area (from other TripAdvisor write-ups) but no chance to explore on this trip.  ",0
13279,"Warning - do NOT chose this hotel !!!  Stayed April 26-30, 2023 in a Junior Suite, Room 850.  Instead of taking a pre-authorisation for a deposit, Dusit Thani Manila charged my Visa card several hundred dollars.  I did not spend any money at the hotel.  Upon check out I was informed the money would be credited back to my Visa card.  More than a month later they have not refunded the money!  Since then I have exchanged 17 e-mails and spoken with 5 of their staff who keep promising to refund the money (Armon Flores, Dhan Basco, Lyn Vistan, Gerald Uy and Abby Niebres).  The hotel has not refunded the money and I am skeptical they will ever re-pay the deposit, which should not have been charged in the first place!   Thus, I have no choice but to advise other prospective guests to avoid this hotel.  They robbed me of PHP 12,000 which is Singapore dollars $298.93.  Do not book this hotel.  ",0

13488,"My wife and I were in France for our Honeymoon and we were very disappointed in this hotel and their staff.   First off we tried revising our reservation which Hotel De Suede was not able to accommodate. We wanted to check in a day later than our reservation was for. I emailed them approximately 42 hours before our stay and they told me they have a 48 hr minimum notice no exceptions. Upon the first email they never responded to me so i emailed again and then they responded. We were stuck in Nice because the TGV train was completely booked so we couldnt get back to Paris to check in.  We ended up renting a car and arriving at 5 AM the next day. The staff at the front desk told me i could park directly in front of their hotel for a few hours so we could get a couple hours of sleep because we were exhausted before moving the car to a parking lot further away.  I woke up a couple hours later to find that my rental car had been towed by the new shift manager. The previous shift staff member failed to tell the current staff member that was their guests car.    Additionally the hotel rooms have no way to plug in american electronics. We had an adapter we used in other hotels but this hotel's plugs were old and loose and the adapter wouldn't stay in the plug.  The bed was very uncomfortable. The bed only had the fitted sheet, no top sheet so you have to sleep with the dirty comforter touching you. You cant control the AC yourself. They manually control the AC/Heat at the front desk. They told us to ""open a window"". Well Paris has dirty air and my wifes allergies were killing her so we couldnt open a window so we slept in a warm room.  All in all this hotel did nothing to try to help accommodate us during our honeymoon stay and made problems even worse by towing our car costing me 200+ euro to get back.  DO NOT RECOMMEND",0

I was checking out the next morning so decided to give the safe lock back the previous night, and explained to the guy at  the reception that it will be a busy morning trying to get to the airport, kids, luggage, taxi etc. The guy told me to return it in the morning and then said in a condescendingly “how hard is it to return it in the morning”..... I explained to him that I will be in a rush, two kids, luggage, etc...and will not have time and may forget.   Whether it’s returning in the morning or previous night, doesn’t matter....there was no need for him to say “how hard is it.....”.    Overall, none of us felt warm nor welcomed during the stay.   ",0

Breakfast was mentioned as buffet however it was just one plate send to room and wasn’t up to the mark. The rooms were too old and only had transparent white curtains on window without a window to close thus  no privacy. Towels and bathrobes were not present but on requesting they provided.

I was not moved and of course it was not sorted, come Sunday morning the same thing happened loud banging, cups clinging, loud talking from 8am. I called again and the Manager tried to gaslight me saying it's impossible that his cleaning staff are there that it must be loud guests, absolutely impossible, so I took this video, shame it wont let me attach to obviously show it wasn't impossible and they started hoovering too 😂 Utter piss take on so many levels. I shouldn't even be paying at this point, utterly unacceptable. Do not stay here, they clearly can't even read basic notes or instructions!",0

Tonight when we got in from our night out, a completely different story, the vending machine just ate our money, ( to be honest, I never thought a 4 star hotel would have a bloody vending machine!) but it does, we put our money in and it over charged us and the guy on reception didn’t care, no help whatsoever!!

Although I needed to wait for a manager approval, this was done and my stay was rearranged.  A few days before my re-arranged stay, I was required to self-isolate and so called Westbridge again (giving the required notice) to re-arrange my stay. On this occasion, they were adamant that it was Groupon's responsibility to deal with my issue despite this clearly not being the case and contrary to Westbridge's own actions on the first occasion of rearranging.

So we asked the reception to change the baby bed , and we get confirmation that the issue will be fixed , after 6 hours we came back to the room we find the same baby bed so I called the reception again they said the hotel is full and no bed available to change .  Another issue the animation is very poor is made by maya club !  The service on food and beverage very slow and with all inclusive offer they dont have  enough drinks only a few of choice   My worst experience in Tunisian hotels .",0
15369,"Been there last summer with wife and 2 kids (4&1). It is located 300-400m from the beach. Beach at the spot is very bad with sharp stones in the sea and sandy beach.  The swimming pool is excellent, together with kid's pool. Hotel has indoor pool. We wanted to use it one windy day, but entry was only permitted to spa guests, which would cost about 25TD (15EUR) per person, which was too expensive to pay. Hotel is clean and the rooms are very nice with large LCD and large balcony.  Food choice is rather limited and repeating every day. Service in restaurants is very bad. Stuff has bad clothes and service speed is low. Once, my baby broken salt pot and waiter started to raise his voice at us and other time I turn down my order of drink because they brought it after 20 minutes and finished meal. Also, dinner was starting at 20.00h which caused kids to be very hungry (the are no shops around to buy anything). No kids meals.  Lunch was not included in rate and only restaurant you can eat is 100m from the hotel building (there are no other places to eat around) and is all open outside with parasols as only protection from the sunshine at 13.30. It was very hot there and the outside temperature was up to 30 only. Imagine how it is when it is 40+? Kid's club is not good with only few toys to play with and animators paying more attention on available parents than the kids. Swimming pool bar is open from 10.30 'till 18.00, so you can only imagine early drink. Majority of guests are from Germany, France and Sweden and most of them retired and few with small kids, causing stuff speaking mostly German and French and very few English.",0
15372,- Bathroom Temperature Regulator definitely out of service .... seems to be a central Problem as other guests suffered from the same issue - Indoor Restaurant without conditioner at 38° ! - The lobby stops the conditioner from 1pm to the Sunset (saving policy ....) - When internet is down it can take them 3 days before they fix it,0
15434,"rooms very small and poorly soundproofed, so that in the morning you hear the cleaning maids, especially if you stay in the rooms near the elevator where they have a compartment. The staff are a litle rude. The check-out is at 10am and they dont give a chance for a ""litle"" late check-out. But if you pay.....they can!!! Is it worth???? No!!!",0
15532,"I have stayed in many hostels as well as another HI in Portland, OR. This was hands down the least favorite of all over the years. The interaction at check in wasn’t sincere. I was sent to a mixed room when I had booked a female dorm. Fortunately, there was a guy in there or I may have gotten settled in before realizing. Co-ed dorms are fine, but I don’t stay in them when I’m traveling alone.  I was switched to a female dorm. In addition to the vibe at check in, the odor in the hostel was something I couldn’t get past. While it seemed clean, it smelled disgusting which just gave the impression of dirty. This is the primary reason for the two rating and because of it I cancelled the second night I was planning at the end of my trip before my return flight. The breakfast was perfect for me. It was easy to get to the hostel from the airport using BART. The area was full of shopping and restaurants and China Town. I encountered several loud, angry, violent even, homeless folks within blocks of the hostel. Within two blocks of the hostel, I along with many others, witnessed a pedestrian who had the right of way in a crosswalk get hit by a car that was turning right. The guy was okay. The car sped off. The odor around the hostel is overwhelmingly of urine. I spent a lot of time walking in the evening and took a nice walk through China Town in the morning. I felt very safe, just stayed a bit extra vigilant.",0
15545,"Got stuck in San Francisco and could not find a hotel for under $700 due to Google conference. I paid $220 (including tax) for a private en suite room.   Absolute rip off - horrible smell in the room. Stains in the bath. But clean carpets and linens. Only getting one star due to high cost for staying in such an ugly, noisy and basic place. Curtains had strange stains.   Really only for students and backpackers. But ridiculously expensive for such a rough place. Must be paying for the location.   If I had the time I would have gotten an Air BnB it stayed out town a bit. Only stay here if you are willing to pay a lot of money to rough it!   To be honest, I am lying on the bed and the strange smell is so pungent, I am worried and am thinking of leaving. ",0
15607,"I rarely write a review but I feel compelled to tell the truth. Checked into Emirhan Apt and the apartment was so old, dirty, rusty. and filled with bad odor that I could not stay more than 3 hours. The furniture looked like trash that was discarded and the apartment was woefully sick. It seemed almost unsafe.  The staff was incredibly nice and understood the reason I checked out after several hours despite paying in advance for 3 nights on Booking. I wasn't going to write a review because I don't want to slow their business. But today I received notice from Booking that the Emirhan Apt Hotel reported that I never showed up and that I cancelled my reservation. That is 100% inaccurate.  Now, I understand the reason all the reviews are good and nobody appears honest in the reviews. Clearly, there appears to be suppression of the truth because the apartment is in terrible condition and seems like it would be emergency shelter for homeless people. It is barely habitable and should cost no more than 10 Euros a night.",0
15676,"The service quality and hotel management are the worst, we have ever faced in a Marriott facility. Although we have conveyed the problems and requested assistance from the hotel management, they declined all. Actually there is a name for GM but he is always out of the hotel and never reply to any customer call or e-mail. One of the worst example of the hospitality sector. I do not recommend this hotel for anybody.",0
15711,Do not stay here! Horrible experience trying to get to the hotel! As long as their is road construction going on do not risk your life! You will have to drag luggage through the scariest conditions!  I tried to report this to Marriott and their response was; “ I will report it”.,0
15857,"In the end, hotel is about the experience. The many small details make it a non memorable experience. In a so called 4 star hotels, I wouldn’t expect to have to call the front desk to get toilet paper or soap, as there was none after cleaning (more than once). I also would not expect a “you must go downstairs to get your bottle of wine openned” response. All in all, It was way below expectation, nothing really stood out as really good. On the lighter side, location is great.",0

15984,"I normally only write good reviews and only in the very rare exception when I've experienced really bad service do i write a bad review.  In fact this is the first time i have written a bad review of the service at moon palace.  I received the worst customer service at Moon Palace Sunrise from Marivel who was seving pizza area.  Because the oizza coming out of the oven was hot, I asked for a second plate and Marivel told me she didn't have any more.  I got 3 slices on a small plate and when I gave it to the kids they asked for another plate because the pizza was too hot for them.  I politely went to ask Marivel for another plate and she ignored me like she hadn't heard me, I asked for her name and she ignored me yet again but her coworker who stood next to her heard me and gave me a plate.  Marivel was one of the rudest employee I have ever encountered at moon palace ever since visiting since 2009.  Stay away from her if you ever run into her because she is not representative of the majority of the staff at  moon palace, who are polite and very well trained in customer service.  I also waited for 10 minutes to share my experience with the manager, Marlene, but she never showed up.",0
16225,"The hotel pictures are not the rooms that you are getting. My boyfriend and I are in our twenties so i believe they did not take us seriously. We had no AC in our room our entire 3 day stay. I asked multiple times for it to be fixed or move to a different room and never received any help. Front desk lady said she would get somebody on it multiple times & never did. I was never once offered a discount or anything for staying in a sweaty hot 82 DEGREE room for 3 nights. They sent multiple people to touch the thermostat, say it was working, and leave. IT WAS NOT WORKING. i had to ask for a late checkout fee to be waived. nothing else was offered to compensate my extremely inconvenient stay. I will be calling the BBB because this honestly was Illegal.",0
16232,"This hotel looks nothing like the pictures, very dingy inside and outside. Early check in was requested and they (front desk) said that they had no control over it, it was all up to housekeeping to get it done. It took them 2 hours and 15 minutes to clean our room at which point it was well after the check in time of 3pm. The hallway to our room was so dark we could barely see the rooms. Our door looked like it could just be pushed open, you could see the light coming out from the room through the cracks in the door frame. Our room was decently clean, but the bathroom was not clean (shower floor was dirty, looked like mold under the bathroom sink). Front desk claimed we had a better view and it was literally right above a dirty alley and you could see a tiny glimpse of the ocean. They only have one person working at the restaurant which means extremely slow service and the food tastes like they got it from a dollar store. They had electrical boxes throughout the hotel and outside with exposed wiring within reach of children. One of the days, housekeeping left our room door open after cleaning it for what we assume to be hours (thank god nothing was missing.) There were two front desk men that were extremely rude and we had to walk away at one point because the older balding gentlemen was being horrible and we couldn't take it anymore. We were extremely disappointed with the entire stay at this hotel and wish we would've spent a tiny bit of extra money on a nicer hotel on the actual beach.",0
16247,Pictures are misleading. Staff at the desk handled complaints poorly. It's filthy throughout. Too long wait for food and cigarette ash on tables outside where you eat (not cleaned). Pool is filthy nobody used it while we were sitting out. Lots of street noise. Hairs in our towels and bathroom window would not close fully. Staff on reception were cold. No atmosphere in the hotel. Never asked how was our stay. ,0
16251,"This hotel looks nothing like the pictures they have posted on all sites including booking and Priceline. The pool was dirty, the rooms are falling apart at the seems. The hotel room doors barely close, flooring bubbles up, rooms smelled horrible and the air conditioning seldom worked. The staff was not very helpful and the bar (if that is what you call it) was out of most drinks and they too were not helpful.  Over all, this place was not worth the $180 a night at all. Overall rating 0.5 out of 10.",0
16252,"The hotel o really was generally taken care of and clean for a south beach hotel. Once we arrived at our room, the issues started. The front desk never picked up the phone (tried in three different occasions/times), the bathroom door didn’t close, the soap rack in the shower was literally falling off the wall, the tub was clogged and didn’t drain at all, the face towels had blood stains, the night stand lights did not work and there were no outlets by the bed to plug in any device needing charge. We realized that we had no ice bucket in the room and let a house keeper know, but none were brought to us that afternoon. By the time we got back from dinner, we realized it was still missing so we (tried to reach the front desk but no answer) had to go downstairs to the front desk where the guy that eventually came up told me that “house keeping has left, the manager keeps those things locked away, and guests usually notice things missing at check in and should come to front desk immediately to get what is missing.” — it was only 8PM, and we had requested this item previously. He offered no solution so I ask if he at least had a trash bag where I could collect ice, which he did… only to find out out that the only ice machine (in lobby) was broken. We had to ask the bar inside the restaurant, where the servers/bartenders seemed bothered by the request and having to help. The TV stopped working at 11PM and never worked again. We only stayed one night. Never again.",0
16253,"DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. The service is terrible and staff are RUDE! If you ask for ANYTHING they will say ok but will never bring it to you. They have roaches and the rooms are filthy. I opened a toilet paper roll and a TOACH came out of it. I asked housekeeping to clean our toilet again and he said, “it’s been clean”. I asked again and he said, “oh you one of them”? The food at the restaurant isn’t good except for the wings. The waitress has an attitude and is very rude to Americans. William is sarcastic and rude when I requested 5 sets of towels and wash cloths. He said, “it’s not allowed”. I express to him that they’ve done it before with the manager permission. He said, “I’m not going to make them bring more. If they do then they do and if not then you get nothing”! He asked the man in Spanish in front of me so I have no clue of what was said. On the website it says their rooms were remodeled…all they did is put new floors in. Everything is nasty and old. One of our rooms had a mold like smell in the bathroom that made my mom nauseous. One of the room AC unit wouldn’t cut off so my family was freezing for 2 nights before the manager made maintenance go back in the room to fix it. Someone left bags of trash and dirty towels outside and we requested for someone to remove it. 24 hours later I had to speak to the manager and provide a photo of proof. Housekeeping lady was called and she argued with me and the manager stating it wasn’t there before. I told the manager I was NOT going back and forth with her and requested the trash to be removed because it was starting to smell. My family and I are not nasty ppl. We have a touch of OCD to be honest. Needless to say, this hotel wasn’t to our standards, doesn’t deserve 3-4 star and we will NEVER stay here again!",0
16254,I must say that the accommodations were awful.  The room/establishment clearly has not been maintained.  It was so Bad that I actually did not even stay in my room after checking in but and checked into another hotel.   The computer system was down upon arrival. The telephones do not work as I tried to call ahead of time for several days. There was peeling paint in the room. The peep hole In the door was missing and had some gross stuff coming out of it. The room and bathroom were really small. There were rust stains around some of the outlets. All in all it was not a good experience and the fact that the phones do not work was a MAJOR indicator. I would really appreciate some of my money back.  Either way I will never stay there again nor would I recommend it. Side note: I was too grossed out to take pics.   Don’t waste your money.,0

I called again, same scenario. I called for the third time and asked to be transferred  to a manager who speaks English and received an answer - the leader is busy, he calls you back. He did, in around 20min my cell phone rang for 1sec and at the moment I picked it up, he hung up again. I called the front desk again, same story - the leader calls you back. I wonder, is there just one person at the whole hotel who speaks English? The only way how to fix it is to put down the Marriott logo from the premises and dont raise it up back until all staff at front desk, reservations and restaurants speak at least basic English. Shame on Marriott to hire such a poor management team that is not able to train its staff. Very disappointed.",0

There is nothing to do here and staff is not particularly helpful apart from the engineer who help us to fix up the air con and the non functioning sockets for the kettle. Housekeeping actually ask us to boil water on the bed side table before they were willing to send an engineer in.....  Waiter at breakfast gave us a dirty look because we show up 15mins before the buffet closes, checking his watch and was reluctant to let us in, good thing the waitress just jumped in and help us get a table... we are just planning to get one round anyway and when we left there were still a few tables eating... other places we went to would usually just remind us that they will take the food away soon and ask us to get all we need first, which we usually do.

17099,"Good day Eva,  I write this email with a heavy heart.  After booking luxury room for 11 th Feb , together with booking 7 course meal for the night of 11 th February , I am very unhappy about the hotel service, the lack of organisation and the general bad treatment my husband and I received.  We arrived at 13.10 on the day of 11 Feb and were received at reception by a lady called Linah.  We got allocated room 97 of which it had maintained issues , namely , no functional door lock mechanism and phone was off line so we could not phone reception to alert them of door malfunction.   We resorted to phoning reception from our cell phone..   Then , A gentleman called Levi wanted to give us a lower priced room which we declined and he finally allocated us room 93. Now this room 93 had a seat with fabrics that was torn and in need of fresh upholstery!  Then we got ready for dinner.   Arrived at restaurant at 6.30 sharp only to find that the host is unaware of our booking for the 7 course dinner.   This host was very unprofessional and didn’t not know how to handle guests when there is a dispute or misunderstanding   . She told that there is no 7 course booking for (black ) people on that night and that the only 7 course booking was for (white) people. This statement I find RACIST!  Then , we were sent back to reception to enquire about our ‘missing’ 7 course meal booking.   On arrival there we were told by the gent: Levi , that EVA had not completed our dinner booking and that there were no ingredients to make that 7 course meal for us.   At this stage , my husband and I were very disappointed as we had an email confirmation of stay and dinner both of which were fully paid.   We were then made to sit at the restaurant without any one offering us something to drink or even not offered something as small as bread while we wait.  What was most disturbing as we were left neglected was that a (white ) couple that arrive 30 minutes after us were offered bread and drinks as we just stood there.    Also amazing was that there were ingredients available to make dinner for the white couple?????  We ultimately returned to reception and asked to be checked out of the hotel the same night of 11 th Feb .  The service we received is the poorest we have Eva seen and we’re very unhappy.   I request a refund for room and a refund for 7 course meal.  Regards Dr S Dlangamandla-Mokoka ",0
17116,"We have booked in for a weekend with my friend, whereby everything was superb until we went in for our spa appointment. We decided to go into the facities (sauna and shower). Immediately when we came out there was water all over the floor with no wet floor caution sign. My friend tripped and fell, landing on her wrist. The manager Karla, came on hearing her scream and asked if she was OK.  She did not do any accident report whatsoever. It's like she did not care.  Unfortunately her wrist got swollen later, which made it difficult to sleep at night. We called out for a first aider but we told there was no first aider on site.... Which made it clear that they don't have any health and safety measures in place. Probably that's the reason why Tha Spa manager could not follow the healthy and safety procedure. Now we ended sleeping at the hospital instead of our room that we paid a fortune for..... Really disappointed....",0

And also, you can’t check in if you are alone and waiting for your friend who would come later :). Very interestingly retarded rules. I had much higher expectations from this hotel. We are very disappointed.  The peak of our dissatisfaction and disappointment is that our car was robbed and the window was broken in pieces in front of the hotel and no one called us to inform us about it even tho they had our phone number.   Also, when we parked in the garage after the accident one male from the hotel came to garage to CHECK IF WE PAID FOR THE GARAGE, even if our car was robbed and had NO WINDOW.   Ps. Don’t expect to have your spot in garage because there is maybe 30 parking spots and 200+ hotel rooms :) And on the other side, don’t be surprised if your car is robbed  IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL.

Me and my friends do not smoke, a serious allegation made against me and my guest. They've accused me of doing something illegal and did not want me to be frustrated. ME AND MY GUESTS DO NOT SMOKE AND PLEASE DO NOT ASSUME THAT WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE OF COLOUR THAT THEY DO. The manager is rude and repeatedly told me on the phone we smoked weed. I REPEAT WE DO NOT SMOKE LET ALONE WEED. I even heard her and her colleague sniggering at me they found my frustration amusing.  How would you feel with such an accusation? I'm livid and seeking advice from trading standards and citizens advice. YOU WILL NOT ACCUSE ME AND MY FRIENDS OF SUCH AN ALLEGATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT. I do not know what they smelt but please do not assume because you see people of colour it's weed. THAT'S RACISM! I am a 45 year old woman and am applaud at the accusation. My business brought them extra guests as I encouraged my friends to stay so I even brought business to them. Me and my guests are highly offended. The manager refused to give me the owner's name's so i can address them directly in my letter of complaint and she didn't hand over her name information you are obliged to give customers.  BE WARNED this manager even say's she has a witness her colleague so she will make you feel like you cannot win the argument, but I know none of us smoked so understand the level they will go to KEEP YOUR MONEY.    The restaurant is closed so don't expect to eat there, information they failed to give me when i booked.   The parking is not on sight you will have to drive a way down and unlock it yourself in pitch darkness.  Expect drug addicts in the surrounding area as we saw as we drove up to the hotel and was later approached by some when we went out for the evening.  I wasn't going to say a word about all this but since they want to accuse me of smoking weed I thought I'll inform anyone looking to book the hotel so they don't have the surprises i had.   I am so offended I have no word's really that I have been accused and treated like this.  Expect the manager to speak over you constantly she doesn't want to hear a word you say.  Me and my guests will be seeking advice on such allegations you will hear from us, I will not just simply go away from such a serious false allegation.  You can tell they are a privately owned hotel who clearly will stop at nothing to keep deposits which screams desperation.

The whole thing was very upsetting too in the way it was approached.   Have never heard of anyone being charged for laundry in a hotel before.   Quite a smart hotel in a not very smart location. Could even be described as scary but a definitely unsettling atmosphere in the local neighbourhood.   Breakfast was hugely disappointing, just a paper bag with a few tiny pastries and acarton of nasty orange juice in delivered with a paper cup of vending machine coffee.   Avoid Avoid Avoid.",0
18585,"The room was so small we didn’t even have space for our luggage with our kids. The garage could only fit small cars. If you have something slightly larger you have to park elsewhere. The restaurant will only take reservations, you cannot walk in and the run out of reservations pretty quick. I asked for extra pillows and I was told there are no extra pillows in the hotel. Terrible experience, would not recommend at all ",0
18616,"We are booked to arrive at the hotel in mid April. We have a plan to visit famous restaurants and trying to book in advance, but facing challenges as most restaurants don’t have English speaking staff.

18690,I spent 2 very sleepless nights at this hotel. The train went non stop right outside my window and I couldn’t sleep. The toilet leaked. There were no channels to watch on the TV. The carpet was so filthy. I can’t believe this is in downtown Chicago. ,0
18696,"I'm not picky about hotels. But this place was awful. Room was so tiny. Little tiny window A/C unit that never got room to a comfortable temp because it was too small for even that little closet of a room. Couldn't close the curtain because it blocked the little bit of air conditioning from going into the room. Bathroom door opened inside and toilet was behind the door. Very hard to use toilet. None of the electric outlets in the room worked. None of the outlets and usb ports on the desk worked because it had no where to plug into. No microwave, no fridge, no vending machines. No nothing. Employees appear annoyed all the time.",0

Only 2 sets of towels for 4 of us.  When you flush the toilet or if other rooms did something, water would discharge from the tub faucet.  Noise, bring a sound machine or download an App! Because of the location, you'll hear the subway trains running.  I understand its Chicago, parking across the street is $46 a night.  Diagnol from the hotel is another spot that is only $30. You do not get a discount for the parking or have your ticket verified.  I gave it 2 stars and that's only because the location is great.",0
18747,"We found bed bugs after my fiancée woke up sick to her stomach and came back to bed. It was 3am and we saw the bug crawling around on the pillow. I went down to the front desk to show them a video and pictures, and the staff woman simply offered another room, ON THE SAME FLOOR ONLY 3 DOORS DOWN. I went back to the room, sifted through all our stuff to ensure there were no bed bugs in anything else (we had checked the room before taking it). We only found one more after looking at the bed again and we finished packing and left.  At the front desk, I handed in the keys and asked if they could pay for a new hotel as last minute hotels are expensive and we didnt want to cut our trip short but we also were not staying at Travelodge anymore. They said no. I then asked for a refund and they said that we might get a partial refund but she'll put it in our notes. Extremely unhelpful and it seemed like she didnt care about our plight at all.",0
18748,Our room greeted us with a giant stain in the carpet when we opened the door. TV did not work but maintenance came to fiddle with it “don’t wiggle this cable”. Our key card stopped working had to be reprogrammed. The weather turned cold but the radiator in our room didn’t work. The blankets were very thin so I tried to use extra pillows to keep warm but did not sleep well due to the cold (no extra blanket in room). In the morning I asked about the lack of heat in our room and was told that the heat had not been turned on in any rooms because “it would have been too hot”.  When I called ahead of time to ask about parking they told me a lot across the street was $46 per day. When I asked for cheaper alternatives they said there weren’t any (we found cheaper Millenium garages nearby).,0
18749,"I was just surprised that the description and pictures did not match the reality. I didn’t complain to staff because they are aware of how filthy that place is. But they are deceiving people by acting like that place is accurate. The curtains are dusty, hot water doesn’t work but the bathroom, very stuffy so you need the air on and the air conditioning unit is extremely loud, tv doesn’t work, no extra towels, carpet has way too many stains and the sheets for the bed are very thin. Would not recommend every booking and this site should do better with checking the truth on the advertisement. ",0
18758,Horrify and very disappointed dirty cold outdated no sense of decor mismatch furniture. Customer service was rude or nonexistent. Housekeeping could not assist us because our room was not on the list. We were suppose to get breakfast but no directive on where to get it. There s no parking garage. The operation and the parking garage look like a side operation. I am so disappointed with this hotel.,0
18759,"The pictures on the web don’t depict luxury rooms, but they certainly don’t depict the true state of the rooms either. They are old, dirty, and almost completely bare. Though there was ample room for gymnastics in the room, there was no seating. If you’re looking for comfort food somewhere else. If you just need a place to crash and don’t mind the frequent sound of trains or the radiator waking you, this is the spot. ",0
18760,"While the hotel is well situated, there are some issues to be aware of. The L train rolls by every 7-10 minutes and for light sleepers this is a problem. The front desk staff were the most pathetic group of staff I’ve encountered. No help with the local area, no flexibility, no concern for you, and they all acted as though they wanted to be anywhere but where they were. Not at all what I was expecting in the hospitality industry. ",0
18874,"Our experience began with a most obnoxious waiter named George at the Roof Garden Restaurant (with a view of the Acropolis), where we went for our lunch. We were early and chose to sit at one of the tables in front that was not marked or reserved. George told us, curtly, to take a table at the back. We hesitated and returned to the front table and spoke to a lady who welcomed us to take the table in front. The lady who served us was good and kind, nothing special but as it should be at such a hotel, and we had a great lunch. When we left the restaurant we met George again who was now all full of smiles, evidently because of the small fortune we had spent on food and wine. I told George that he was a bad man for having tried to send us to the back.  We stayed three days at the hotel and were on the butler floor but never saw one. On the last morning, because we had no coffee capsules refilled the day before, I spoke to reception and asked why we had no butler service and why the coffee capsules consumed  the day before were not refilled. Soon we had a butler and his manger knocking on our door with a tray filled with an assortment of some 10 capsules of coffee, profusely apologizing for having overlooked us. They even called me while I was at the airport departure lounge, and said that they would credit our Bonvoy account with additional points!  The crowd in the mornings at the reception was like a war zone - see photo. I find it hard to believe this is a luxury 5 star hotel, part of the Bonvoy chain. We paid a small fortune for each day for our stay and had a really bad experience.  Today, I saw in our newspaper, as reported in the New York Times, that some migrants including a baby, who arrived on the shores of Greece were put on a inflatable life raft and set a drift on the Aegean Sea by Greek coast guards. Bells rang, and it confirmed my thinking that George's and the Butler's actions were a reflection of the current Greek culture. As an Asian, I remain offended by the services. provided by the hotel.    ",0

19085,"Unsanitary nightmare place for your Paris Stay.  Marriott shamelessly claim this hotel as 5-star, which fooled me into booking this place.  The moment I stepped into my room, I realized it is no where near 5-star quality. I would not even give it 3-star for the poor room condition it was in. Let me just list a few: Very obvious and gross stains on the sofa; crooked door lock that cannot be secured locked from the inside; hair on the towel before I even touched it; broken curtain. Oh by the way, someone mentioned that one of the elevators was fixed in August, but guess what? it is broken again in September!  I have stayed at more than 6 different 5-star hotels in Paris. I know what to expect from a 5-star property at this price range in Paris, and I can say this hotel is no where near that. Save yourself some trouble book elsewhere instead!",0

When I decide to take my package from hotel conceirge back, I have found hotel staff writing on my LV package.   I have tried to contact the hotel for reason/ explanation, but they kept silence and no response.   No response or no reply from anyone.

19109,"I was at the hotel between 24/09-26/09 we booked through booking and never again will book this hotel and never again will. Use booking as well. Hotel should be 5***** but actually it's more like 2 and half or 3***, no balconys, no roof top with bar Nothing. We should go and ask on reception on this 5* hotel someone to come and change our towels and the worse it's the next. 5 days after I did the check out and calling at the hotel many times and calling booking as well many times, hotel manager still don't want to move his ass and send me the invoice for my stay. This is kind of very very poor experience paying 720 euro for 2 nights and they even don't provide you a Invoice. After many times speaking with booking they said that contact a person/manager  from a Hotel called  Brouillaud and he or she promised that will send the invoice few days ago and still Nothing.    MR./MS. BROUILLAUD  you are there to give great service for the clients not to make them look like idiots I wrote you a private message on your email and still no answer for my invoice.

19292,My stay at the hotel was a very  unsatisfactory experience. I found  the attitude of the staff to be totally unprofessional. In particular the manager on shift was intimidating hostile abusive and aggressive. This is not a place I recommend any traveller,0
19596,If I could give this hotel 0  ⭐️ I would.  Customer service was absolutely wretched.  The rooms were disgusting and dirty.  The first room they gave me had 4 roaches. I finally got a second room close to midnight.  A manager has yet to call me back.  They don’t cap the amount of people in the pool area so people were leaving their belongings thrown on the rocks around and with so many people in the pool drinking the water was cloudy.  Housekeeping would come into the room only remove the trash and towel and not replace with any clean towels.  When my husband was going to drop me off to check out so I can get down and speak to the manager we were told not to get off that it was an automatic check out and I needed to call and dispute the charge.  I have yet to get a call from a manager or anyone for that matter.  This hotel was highly rated by Florida Travel and Leisure magazine but clearly the person who wrote the article has never visited the resort because they claimed this was a top water park resort but it only had two slides and a kiddie area.  STAY AWAY!  HORRIBLE!,0
20346,"Booked this so called well-known hotel and the experience was Terrible. It was an anniversary gift for my partner who I couldn't be with due to Covid, and was a tragic waste of that one special time of year. I booked a nice luxury room spa package for her a week in advance, and was in touch with their guest relations team Mark Zhao, Maeve Yang, LIU Doris. I clearly explained through detailed emails that this is a gift, I am not going to be present. I paid for the room, the massage, a wine bottle, a bouquet of flowers, and dinner. My gf was supposed to check-in, facetime me, enjoy her massage which I booked and was supposed to surprise her with, then come up and have flowers wine and dinner sent to her (surprise) along with a card I wrote her. All of that was thrown into the bin by Sofitel's carelessness for their guests. Her check-in was chaotic, delayed for 2 HOURS. She sat in the lobby and waited. That was embarrassing for me. I called the hotel to see what the hell was going on and got put on hold for 25 mins after being transferred 2 times (surprisingly these guys don't speak much English). They finally comprehended my question which was ""when can she check in, its been two hours?!"" and said they'll have her start off the massage first while the room gets ready. So the front desk sends her to the massage reception, who tell her ""you can't start the massage until you have your room number"". She goes back down and waits a bit more, I call them and tell them about my frustration and finally they get her to her massage. She then gets to her room and I'm hoping they don't mess up any further. Her dinner arrives, then later the wine and bouquet of flowers which were supposed to be a surprise gift from me. The delivery man tells her the bouquet of flowers and wine are sent to her from the Hotel Manager as an apology for the late check-in. There goes my gift...... I then contact these geniuses and tell them how they messed up and after giving excuses their manager Hillary Zhao agrees to not charge for the flowers and wine, and ""refund the amount into my Alipay account"", While I paid with a credit card.. I contacted her THREE times since I got my credit card bill which seems to include the charges, and haven't received a response. Sofitel should be ashamed of themselves for holding such a low standard in customer service, management and guest relations. Their management is a complete mess. I regret booking this hotel as an anniversary gift, it was a complete waste.",0

20614,"I travel alot and i pick my hotels carefully,   Pictures at booking websites doesnt look like the actual..  When we arrived we carried our luggage.. There was no bellboy untill we complained.  Second problem was the smell of the room when we first walked in. Smelled like sewage.  Third problem its was so hot in the rrom and the AC doesnt work well.. Complained twice about it and they told me it cant be better. Room temperature wasnt lower than 25 with the AC on for 10 hours.  Last thing i wanted to say when we had dinner at the big buffet they have... Food doesnt taste good at all  I believe they have low standards for 5 star hotels. Example for that.. The telephone device they hace in the rooms in old enough and outdated, however the problem is they dont  have a phone directory on it or next to it.. So when you want to call the reception you have to guess their # and dial.  Also the toilet in mounted to the wall so hight which is not appropriate at all..  And thats not the end of the list... I dont have more time for this... ",0
20615,"We stayed at TUI Sensimar Ulysse Palace in Djerba, Tunisia for 3 nights.  Upon arrival no room was available and we had to wait on the lobby for more that 3h.   According to the impolite and very unprofessional reception manager, Mr. Issam, our reservation did not exist - notice we booked everything with TUI Belgium (plane hotel and transfers).   The accommodations provided did not meet a standard of cleanliness and quality to be expected from this type and price of hotel and instead we were accommodated in an area under construction (as you can confirm from all the attached photos).  Non working safe/fridge, door hangers falling.  Entering the room while we were sleeping without permission  As you might imagine by the above description our trip to Tunisia was not pleasant, instead it caused us stress, annoyance and disappointment with the service.   The images of he hotel they sold us on the office were not matching what we encounter there.   At the end they offered us 50€ for all the troubles caused... which is even more insulting. I was not expecting this from TUI.be   ",0

We were then told to move to another room and at that time I went to the gym to steam off .. my partner and I then got moved to the second room and guess what! NO HOT WATER !!! Couldn’t shower at all! We called the reception again ( they don’t understand a single work of English tbw.. ) took them another 20 mins to come up and try to give us another (3rd) room..  this time the door could not lock !!!!

I stayed in this hotel in October 2022, and even though I contacted their customer service numerous times, to this date, they never returned $300 to me. I still don't understand why they even charged a deposit of $300 when there was nothing in my room to spend on, no mini-bar, not even a shower gel..only some ratty towels....not even a bottle of water as a courtesy. Very unprofessional and disappointing.",0
21437,"While the hotel has a good location and a fancy lobby, the rooms are quite literally falling apart. In our 2 day stay, we had to ask for new cards twice, had to have someone come to fix the windows because the AC was letting cold air in. The ac was also old and falling apart. They say they have kitchen but there is no utilery whatsoever, which makes the kitchen quite useless. (forks, cups and such) and no pans to use. Oh, also, there is literally no table to eat, in case you actually used the kitchen to cook or heat something. The furniture itself is also precarious, the shower was disastrous and part of the tub was broken, and we had half of the amenities. The sofa bed was impossible to sleep in, extremely unconfortable and with some really sharp edges in the middle. Worst of all, we were sent some medication overnight (that we forgot and absolutely needed) and they did not bother to deliver it until one day after. My husband had to actively wait for half an hour to retrieve it, otherwise they would not do it. The delivery was there one full day before they bothered to find it. They did not apologize or acknowledge their mistake.   We spent close to 1000 for two rooms 2 nights, it was terrible in every possible way. ",0

The carpet was ripped, headboards and nightstand covered in a variety of different stains, bathroom sink was leaking, and the tub literally had fixtures falling off.

Do not stay here unless you enjoy paying hundreds of dollars to sleep in filth. We also couldn’t turn the heat down or off and it was unbearably hot.",0

As these one was cleaner than the other but looking at the photos you would not think so. The first one was dirty the second room bed wasn’t made wallpaper peeling off the walls again stunk. The third time they gave us a room, I’ll see if I yourself don’t know how these people are in business, nobody will answer the phone to help. We purchased sprays and candles to get the smell out. We were only sleeping there with limited time we had no time to mess around. But having to change rooms so many times and taking away from our short trip was very frustrating.  They need to refund us for having to put up with this hotel. The time we are there not much to chose from as most Hotels were booked.",0

21501,"The first room we were put in was dirty - hadn't been hoovered and the bathroom was covered in hair (floor and bathtub). There was also a noisy, dirty AC unit in the window which was right next to the bed. We asked to move to a different room and while there was no hair in the bath, it seemed equally as dated and dirty. There are stains on the carpet and scuffs on the walls and furniture. The AC unit is unbelievably noisy, and the windows offer no soundproofing at all - I have stayed in NY a few times and I understand it's a noisy city, but there is a constant noise of sirens, horns, and building works (Penn station just opposite is a 24-hour building site). Also found a cockroach in the room.",0
21642,"A horrible experience!!! The suite with a bath with hydro massage appeared to look straight at the wall with a very dark light inside the room and cheap motel-like lights, which created a feeling of being in a cellar with an old furniture, no space to open the wardrobe and walk freely, NO air-conditioning, NO outer light, which started making me claustrophobic, and a mini-bar shining in your face when you sleep, overall giving absolutely NO reason to having paid 285€/night for this room!!! During the reservation we asked for it to have a convertible bed for a 3rd person in a room, but when we arrived I was shown leather sofa blocks which had a broken mechanism, so it couldn’t be made as a sleeping place (and actually even with a working mechanism it would never count as a proper place to sleep) and the receptionist girl didn’t know anything about how to prepare it!! Finally, she called for her colleague who spoke only French, which I fortunately understand, and he said that the mechanism is broken, so, firstly, I was offered to sleep on a mat on the floor!! However, having declined this option, I fortunately was offered to sleep in a room in front (which though didn’t have Wi-Fi), but the only thing they managed to offer instead of this wine cellar was a tiny standard room with a tiny window but without ANY features of the suite that we have paid for. Oh, and it was the next day, because our first night they said they’re “complet” and can’t do anything!! Finally, we sticked with this horrible dark room, where by the way it shakes you and wakes you up with the noises of working engines and from the corridor... Stuff here is very incompetent, especially the receptionist girl, who is saying “We are complete” for any request and unwilling to do anything to conform with the title “VIP hotel”, especially in terms of the attitude to the client. Location is horrible, there’s absolutely nothing to do here, the price is unimaginably high for such a level of service and amenities, and I would say it’s a rather 2-star hotel, definitely not a 4-star one!! By NO WAY!! If only we hadn’t paid the full price for 3 nights at the beginning, I would definitely cancel on it and try finding literally anything else, because ANY other place would be a better place to stay in Paris. Especially, for this money!! That’s by far THE most horrible experience I’ve ever had in Paris!! Save your trip and don’t come here!! I have my last night here, and I can’t wait to get out of it!!",0

22086,"I 'd like to share my recent experience with this hotel. To me hotel should rate based at least 3 categories: design, cleanliness and services. It does not have a closet, you have to hang your coats and outfit on the wall, the bed sheet is only changed every four day, that leaves your room a mess. They don't clean the room or make the bed, they just change the new towels when you drop the used ones in the basket, if not they won't replace with clean ones. In Vegas the bed sheet is changed every other day or everyday on request, but even when it is not changed, the room is still cleaned up and the bed is made. Here they don't change the bedsheet and won't clean the room and won't make the bed. It was a terrible experience, especially it s a hotel in Japan where cleanliness is a priority.  ",0

22486,"My room that I stayed in was absolutely filthy. Floor looked like it had never been cleaned, the were did stains on pretty much every flat surface and the sink arms counter top absolutely reeked of urine. There was even yellow stuff on the sink and counter tops. I was so grossed out that I started wearing sneakers throughout the whole time there. ",0
22487,"We checked in Saturday April 10 and were assigned a room on the second floor. Upon opening the door and prior to entering, the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. I went to the front desk to request another room and was told there were no other rooms available and they would not give a refund. I was momentarily speechless at her inability to try and find a solution. I requested to speak to the manager and was told she was not in and would not answer her phone. I asked the desk clerk to go up to the room and check for herself and was simply told no. I told here this was unacceptable and upon further discussion for another several minutes, she finally said she had another room with 2 beds instead of the king bed in the smoke room. I said of course, why didn’t you say so at the beginning? I think a lesson in customer service would be a great benefit. And there were a set of false eyelashes left attached to the lamp shade. WOW",0
22489,"my family stayed at this hotel for one night,but planned on returning 2 days later for another vist. before we checked out we went ahead and booked for our second stay. We told the front desk we wanted a king size bed with a sleeper sofa. When it came time to check into our roomyuo can imagine the suprise we had when indeed there was not a sleeper sofa but a SWING!! yes a swing hanging from the ceiling. I called downstairs and they said they had no other rooms avaiable. If there were closer hotels to the expo center i would defiantly not stay here again.",0

Only one chair in the room and a swing hanging from the ceiling....really?? I was sitting on the bed reading and a spider comes down from the ceiling and landed on my leg..didn't sleep all night.  Get up to use the bathroom at 4 am and the door locked and couldn't get it open.  Had to get my husband to use a coin on the outside to open the door.  The morning breakfast was empty, other than yogart, coffee and a roll.

The only people who would have known that I was staying there and that I hadn’t shown up yet was the hotel and myself...(do not trust this hotel!) I will NEVER stay at a Super 8 again. They were just trying to get more money for my room during a very busy weekend of Austin City Limits. I am incredibly disappointed.,0

The service is worst, watering another table, but this table was ignored many times. Everyone's glasses were emptied, but even if I looked at them from here, I wondered if I couldn't see them.

The hotel refused, not because they were busy, but they wanted to charge us. Arrived to the room to find blood on the sheets. What surprised me the most is when we told them the Hotel staff and manager did NOTHING. They said ""sorry"", and did nothing, didn't even make a note of the issue nor rectify the situation. This means the Hotel does not always change their sheets. gross!",0

Impossible to sleep in these conditions.  In the morning, the breackfast was ridiculous with burnt / dry scramble eggs, chemical fruit juices...evec the expresso was bad.  Apparently the only thing they can say is ""scusi""...""sorry"".  Horrible experience, never again!!!",0
22934,"Stayed here 4 nights recently. Firstly this place is in the middle of nowhere if you're visiting as a tourist it's easily 30 minutes plus by cab to the city off peak. It's over 60 minutes to get to the airport.  Now, the rooms. The place is in need of a refurbishment. Air conditioning didn't work and there was no heating. We were cold during our entire stay and got sick.   The dinner buffet was empty and we had to go elsewhere at 9pm. Ridiculous.   There isn't even tea and coffee in the room. Not even a mug or kettle.  The place is an outcamp for the local Police who are constantly around in droves.   Walls are paper thin and we could hear conversations and more from other rooms.  Made a big mistake booking here and won't recommend it to anyone.  Definitely not a 4 star in my books or worth the price. Very disappointing experience.",0
22955,"Concierge upon arrival left a very bad impression from the start. Having arrived from a delayed terrible flight, I was looking forward to just relaxing. However, when I was being checked in by a lady named Teresa, she was not very welcoming and not very helpful at all. Unless you are there on business, I suggest you not stay here AT ALL. The room was so stuffy, there were no windows you could open - the air-conditioner was a complete FAILURE. It wasn't functioning properly throughout the night we couldn't sleep! We overheard a couple complaining about the same thing the same night we stayed. Never again. The only friendly people that were there was the bell boy and their van driver, otherwise, I would never stay here again. The location is so far from the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhood was pretty scary!",0
22974,"We spent a week in this hotel during New Year holidays.  I would like to start with the location, which was unbelievably inconvenient.  This is not Rome, it suburbs and definately not a very safe one. If you are travelling without a car, you will have to spend about 45 minutes on the metro to get from the centre, then wait for 15-20 minutes for a bus and finally have a bumpy ride for 15 minutes in it. If you don't want to be robbed, I also won't recommend you to return later than 10 o""clock and try to conceal any packages from expensive boutiques.  There is absolutely nothing near the hotel except for a gas station, casino and a club Cleopatra, which suspiciosly look like a stripclub. The rooms are not very big, poorly furnished, with very very uncomfortable small beds and tiny TV. Our air conditioneer didn't work properly, so the tempreture was a surprise: we could wake up in the middle of the night because it's suddenly 15 degrees and freezing or on the opposite because it started to raise the temperature up to +29. To be fair I should mention, that the room was however always clean. When you leave the room check your lockers on the luggage twice, because we sometimes had a strong feeling that someone was looking through our stuff. As for breakfast, I think it is a very big word for that dry ration that they give to you (no hot meal, sometimes even no cheese for bread, only lots of kinds of bread and buns). In the conclusion I would like to say that maybe in some cases it worth to visit this hotel but only for its reasonable price, for a short period and ONLY if you have your own car. It is definately not a 4 star hotel, max 3-.",0
22976,This is one of the worst 4 star experience in my life. This hotel should not be rated 4 star. This is supposedly a business hotel but there was no internet during my 2 days stay. There is no proper kitchen in the hotel. The breakfast is very very poor. First hotel in my life that does not serve scrambled eggs in the breakfast. My room was freezing when i cheked in. By the way this is a room without windows. They told me a technician will check. They then informed me that it was fixed but there was no change. They asked me to wait couple of hours. After 3 hours they decided to cahnge my room. Try to avoid this hotel. ,0
23024,"Still here now but I can't wait to get home. First room I had had no air con and no water but water was gushing from toilet.   Food is disgusting. Although once the hordes descend and pile up their plates there isn't much left.   This is not somewhere to relax. The hotel sells day passes so the place is packed. Can't get a sun lounger even if I wanted one. Booked this as reviews said there was a quiet pool. There isn't. There are three pools, each with its own loudspeaker playing dance music. Not even quiet on the beach which stinks of seaweed.   Used the toilet in the main reception today and there is faeces smeared on the wall in one of the cubicles. Absolutely disgusting.   Can't wait to go home and I don't think I'll even bother trying anywhere else in Tunisia.  ",0
23027,"Horrible hotel, nothing was good especially the restaurant ; the food was bad and not enough for everyone and not enough hotel stuff to handle a large number of people. The pool was also dirty and we had to wait a long time at the hotel reception to check in which caused a lot of tension for the people who were also waiting and eventually led to quarrel and protesting.",0
23028,"We waited an hour and a half at the reception because they were so unorganized and unprofessional. We also waited 5 hours for a baby cot!!!!! If u need a fridge in your room u need to “rent” one for extra charge!! The room had NO TOWELS (had to call 4 times and still didn’t get any until checkout)!! A/C did not work! We spent the night in a 85 f room temperature!! We barely got any sleep!! The hotel in all is sooo filthy and unorganized!! AC doesn’t even work in the lobby!!! Food was old and reheated, tasted sooooo bad!! By far the worst hotel experience in my life",0
23037,"We were here for a one week all inclusive holiday mid July. This is definitely not an all inclusive hotel, your meals are included but the food is honestly awful and non of us are picky eaters. We still had diarrhoea for a week after we got back. The pools are the nicest thing about this 0lace, though the stairwells smell of urine when you go up to the big slides. Arguments were breaking out at the top of the slides as the life guards were letting their friends skip the queue and people were getting angry. Never seen anything like this before. Checking in on our first day was nightmarish, we stood in a queue for 45 minutes sweating to death. We spent over £2,500 for a family of 4, and we wish we had chosen somewhere else. AVOID!!!!",0
23038,"Never in my life been to any hotel in Tunisia or anywhere like this hotel , doesn't deserve 4 stars , 1 star more than enough service is verrrry bad no AC in the lobby or restaurant , food is disgusting same menus everyday day and night , they said all inclusive I don't see that you have to pay for everything (wifi 3,000td/h , gym 10,000 td/h or 50,000 td/week , no remote control for tv no fridge in the rooms , I had very bad experience they charge 255,000 td/night doesn't worth one penny , I don't recommend it to anyone",0
23040,"I made the mistake to book this hotel for three days at a last minute. This is by far the worst hotel in Sousse and in the whole of Tunisia and it should be avoided at all cost. First it is marketed as all inclusive but I found out that they barely offer a bottle of water for which one has got to queue for over an hour. The permises are very dirty, the swimming pool is smelly and the restrooms are unusable. No room cleaning during the whole stay and they don’t even provide soap. The food supposedly all inclusive is with a ridiculously poor quality and this is compared to all the hotels of the region. And on top of all that, the staff are extremely aggressive and just keep asking for tips that they don’t deserve and hitting on the Ukrainian and Russian females. One may be tempted to book this hotel for a little discount but it would be nothing but flushing money and a recipe for a ruined holiday. ",0
23041,"Hotel food so bad I have no words to describe. Staff told us that the hotel has went down rapidly since the shootings on the beach, that they do not cater for Europeans, only Russians. Bungalows were like dark caves.  Soft drinks were always flat, 2 towels only per 4 people in a room.  2 drinks per person rule at every bar, only 1 bar staff at a time, No soap in any hotel toilet.  Overall a 1 star hotel making it the worst holiday I’ve ever been on. ",0
23051,"Absolutely shocking rooms and FOOD . The rooms as you can see no air con in june with the weather 45c and have 2 kids, the bathroom window as you can see is falling off and really risky to have a shower or a bath , the water works and stops every 10 minutes as it happened to me and the wife half way the shower water STOPS , we stayed 8 days and we only seen chips once in the restaurant,  i even asked the manager why is there no chips when i have 2 kids ? The answer was we had chips 2 days a go 😡😡😡 , pizza the same you get on line for ages and only aloud 1 slice of pizza??😡😡😡 reception lads i spoke to and keep telling me no one care about the customer as angry customers go a way and people not been before will come and that's why is busy.I WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE . Its not cheap either compare to other hotel near by .",0
23057,"Do not waste your time or your money booking here it is the worst hotel I’ve ever been to! I was supposed to of had a 7 day trip but ended up booking an early flight only 2 days in due to how awful it was! Before we booked we were told our rooms would come with a kettle and fridge as every hotel does? Instead there was none of that just two single beds pushed together in our room after we of course paid for a double. As we had a child this was a big issue for us as we needed a fridge & kettle to store and make our daughters food so all of her milk went spoilt. The food was absolutely terrible what all inclusive holiday hotel doesn’t even serve the basic selection of fruits for breakfast? I did not eat a thing from there as everything was absolutely foul even down to the bakery selection everything was ROCK hard. Staff are the most unhelpful and rude people I’ve ever met. Completely blank faced and ignore you as if you are not standing there asking for help. We were told there was a lift in this hotel as we have a buggy, there of course was not one. There are so much negative things I have to say about here it was awful! Please just save yourself the money and book ELSEWHERE!!!!!",0
23058,"GREEDY MANAGEMENT - Awful hotel, overcrowded and not enough staff. Food was terrible and always running out.They make you wait for the food OUTSIDE the restaurant - nearly 1000 people in a small crowded area, no seating with hungry and crying children. No bottled water in restaurant - they did not even fill the big water bottles in which they used TAP WATER.  The woman manager (SAWSAN) is truly despicable, she is very rude and greedy - she will not listen to your complaints. She only wants your MONEY.  If you book your holiday here, then you will totally regret it.  DO NOT STAY HERE - SPEND YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.",0

I’ve spoken to lots of local(Tunisian) people that were staying at the hotel as guests and they all also said that that’s the worst hotel they have ever been to!!!!",0
23062,"I would to say Loudly that this Thalassa Sousse Resort and Aquapark is the worst ever hotel 4 star I have stayed in, it was very very terrible stay, the AC not working at the reception, the AC not working from 2 am till 3pm, giving the excuse that it is under maintenance, the AC at restaurant not working, it seems that you are in Open Hamam. The room was not clean, the bath either, you have 1 bottle of water per day, and the food was disgusting all inclusive ONLY the name, we were obliged to eat outside. I have paid for 3 nights, I escaped with my family, could not resist to leave that hotel. And the aquaparc is opened for the daily entrance which make it crowded and the kind of people entering there. At the end I don't recommend this terrible 4 star hotels to NO ONE specially for families.",0

23090,We stayed in a suite for two nights. Room lovely but did not understand the going on another entrance and having to walk down two streets to get to it. On check out we had to collect our car from the underground car park. There was no entrance we were told about other than down the steep slope. The lift had an out of order sign on. Half way down my husband slipped and thought he had broken his arm. I went to tell reception what had happened but as we had to ge to the airport for our flight my husband had to suffer the pain till we could get him to a hospital in the uk. Upon return and after going to the hospital I contacted the hotel to tell them what had happened and how dangerous this was. I asked for the video footage from the garage for our insurance company.  The hotel manager replied once saying he was waiting for advice on this. I continually chased this and he has two Weeks later still not replied to me.  I will now hand this over to solicitors to deal with.,0

I’ll never use Booking.com or this hotel again. What a cynical way to make money!",0
23191,"We had two rooms, one for my husband and I and one for my parents. Upon checking in at 4pm, my parent's room had not been cleaned. They walked in to a messy bed and towels on the floor. We let the front desk know and went to dinner and a show. We came back and the bed was made, but the room was not clean. There was mess in the sink and stuff on the floor. They called down and were told they could either move or get hilton points. At 10pm, they opted for Hilton points.   The next day, we called down to the Valet for our car and proceeded to the lobby. After waiting 20 minutes, they brought up the wrong car. They then told my husband that it would be another 30 minutes to get the correct car because they were busy. We went to the front desk because after paying $80 to valet, this is completely unacceptable. The talked to the valet and told us our car would be next and if it took more than 10 minutes more, they would credit us. So only after waiting for 40 minutes would we get our $80 back. Surprise, surprise. It took another 20 minutes to get the car. So frustrating. The whole thing was a giant mess and we will be switching to Marriott. ",0
23210,Blood on sheets when we went to bed. After a long day in city… not what we expected to find. This was our first night in the room.  Do they even change the linens?   The blood was through the sheet and on the bed pad.   Told by staff it was rust from the machine…  Until they saw it and realized what it was.   Corporate was useless in getting the issue resolved…,0
23222,We chose a room with a pull out bed in a separate room.    It was SO uncomfortable we were forced to purchase a second room.   The next night they didn’t have any available rooms so we had to buy an air mattress.     I wouldn’t put my dog on that bed!   It was horrible!    ,0

23262,"On December 24, 2021 my family (including myself) checked into the Hilton on the magnificent mile hotel. As I am a Diamond club member, I received an upgrade on my room. While preparing for bed, my daughter noticed a huge stain on her sheet top and bottom. which was very disturbing to us as Covid is very present as we all know! I immediately called down to the front desk and spoke with Nancy the agent on duty. I explained to her my concern and frustrations. She stated that she could send me a set of sheets up for me to change the bed! What? Are you serious???? I was dumb founded and offended. Please recall that I am a “Diamond Member” but she left me speechless!! I asked her to repeat what she said. She really restated it…. “I will send you up a set of sheets to change your bed”! Again we’re living in a Covid world and I’m staying in a hotel room! She then later said ma’am what do you want me to do? I was pissed then! It was late in the evening and we had already unpacked our things for our three day stay. We decided it was too much trouble to move to another room so we took the sheets and changed the bed ourselves. I travel with Clorox wipes and Lysol so I wiped down the bed as well as sprayed it down to sanitize it.  Which brings me to my checkout process today. The agent proceeded to check me out and ask me how was my stay. I told her that my first night stay was a horrible experience and the agents comment was offensive. She listened with compassion and called someone and explained my situation. She stated that she was told to give me 1/2 off on my first night stay. Are you serious? This is really how you treat your customers and your Diamond customers? I’ll be sharing this on all social media accounts because I would never believe the Hilton brand would treat their customers in this regard. It’s COVID and not keeping your customers safety first, is a concern!!!!",0
23264,"The room fell far below expectations. The handles on the bedroom door fell off almost trapping us inside. The outlets next to the bed did not work at all. The beds were in poor condition. The mini fridge stayed at room temp. There was garbage still on the bathroom floor. We did not report the door handles or outlets when we discovered they were broken because it was late at night and we were exhausted. Quite frankly, when you are paying over $300 a night for a hotel room you should not have these issues to report. We didn’t discover the fridge not working until the next morning. I did inform the front desk upon checkout out but was reprimanded for not calling the desk the moment we discovered the issues. Again it was late and we were exhausted. This is our second stay this year. Our first stay was also less than desirable but I always give a business a second chance. There will not be a third chance. Hotel website states in house restaurant and room service. It offers neither.  Hotel offers very limited amenities. Not worth the price. Location is the only positive. ",0
23266,"Nice enough rooms, excellent event management people, and nothing but good interactions with any of the employees. The hotel is understaffed but that is entirely understandable, right now.  Why the bad review? I travel about 45 weeks out of the year and my number one priority is a good night's sleep. I don't care about the bar, restaurant, gym, etc...just let me sleep well.  Some hotels let you cool the room and some don't. It's a choice that the hotel leadership makes, regarding HVAC setup. It's 46F outside and my room won't get colder than 71F. The front desk person let me know that that is the way it is here - you get heat in the winter and cold in the summer and if you want it colder than 71F in the winter you need to go to a different hotel. I appreciate the honesty. I'll go somewhere else - and willing to pay more - for a room that can chill me out while sleeping.",0
23281,"Awful! The smoke detector didn't want us to be there on room entry. Wouldn't stop beeping. They told us to suck it up,it's just one night of incessant beeping. They would not replace the battery or give us another room. Had to figure that crap out ourselves or suffer! And their attitude to our suffering was sorry, we don't care.  The entire weekend was fraught with one dirty thing after another not going right. And every time I called them, when they actually picked up, they had an attitude. I had to call twice just to get towels. And they made it sound like it was my fault that I used towels.  I will never, ever go back there. And I came to town for Andrea Bocelli. Beautiful concert. Will never ever stay at Chicago Lake Shore Hotel again. If it wasn't for an amazing concert, my entire weekend would have been an overpriced crap show.  ",0

We travel everywhere and also treat staff well and tip 30% they need to restaff the hotel desperately! If I owned this hotel I would make serious changes.

It was a bit confusing at the time, but at least we had a room with a view of Lake Michigan. This time around, we were actually at the Chicago Lake Shore Hotel and we both agreed that this place was more like a motel than anything. We pulled our car right up to our room; we were on the first floor and our room was right off the entrance.   Needless to say, this was the noisiest hotel stay either of us has ever had; we could hear guests and housekeeping staff going in and out of the building all morning and afternoon, as well as people talking loudly outside our window. It sounded as though everyone was stomping up and down the stairs, though admittedly, it snowed one night while we were there and therefore, many people were probably wearing snow boots.   We got to see more than we wanted of housekeeping staff when they ignored our 'Do Not Disturb' sign as we were sleeping in late one afternoon and they entered the room. Our bad for not securing the deadbolt! The funny thing was that I was buried under the covers when the female housekeeping staff member knocked and entered our room (after we both yelled, ""No thank you!""), and once she saw my husband lying on top of the bed covers, she closed the door and then had one of her male assistants open it. At that point, my husband and I were more than slightly irritated. Fortunately, we were fully clothed!  There were no highlights to our stay here, but at least the no-frills room was clean when we checked in, we had free parking and it was a very inexpensive stay for the number of nights we were there. We agreed that unless it's an absolute necessity due to a family emergency (we're from Chicago and frequently get back to visit our loved ones), we will avoid staying here. If it's ever an issue of budget and we do not have a lot of money to stay someplace nicer, we will consider this as a last resort. Hopefully the La Quinta Inn & Suites will have competitive prices so that we can stay there again instead.",0
23313,"My cousin recommended Lakeshore Hotel as a reasonably priced hotel along Chicago's  scenic Lakeshore Drive. Unpleasant surprise #1: the hotel had been subdivided into two hotels. La Quinta occupies the lion's share of the building that houses the two hotel lobbies. The Lakeside Hotel lobby could barely accommodate two guest chairs, an ice machine and a nearly empty vending machine.  #1st problem: getting into my room- the key card did not work. After receiving three key cards, the hostess gave up and moved me to a different room. The room was clean and the hotel was quiet but furnishings are very dated. The toilet in my room was definitely not ADA compliant; it was noticeably shorter than a regular commode.  The inroom refrigerator needed defrosting and the freezer section was hanging by one side. Desk lamp not working. Electric outlets inconveniently located. Problem #2y key card no longer worked. I found myself locked out on my second morning.  The hostess had to send me next door to La Quinta Hotel because her keycard machine was no longer working. Both hotels share an inground pool which has been closed all summer for renovation.  While these two hotels share the same campus and buildings, their service, amenities and facilities, and customer service are night and day.",0
23326,"If possible I would give zero stars. When we checked in we were never told about the free shuttle bus or that we needed vouchers for the breakfast that they offer. When we go into the room there was a dirty coffee cup leftover from when house keeping ""cleaned"" the room. They thought we were checking out on the 5th and even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door we had 5 different people knocking on our door that morning. To top it all off there was jewelry left in the hotel room on the 5th but missing when I got back that night I thought I had already packed it it wasnt until I was the airport did I realize it wasn't packed. I rang them straight away they transfered me to about 10 different people  and having to explain the situation every time I was even transferred to La quinta next door. I was told the jewelry had been found only to then be told it hadn't and then it had been then It hadn't. I was told I was would get call backs but I never did it's 8 days since I checked out and still no word on my jewelry that I know never left the hotel room. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU CAN!",0
23331,"I booked this hotel because I was attending a course at UChicago. When I first arrived, I realized that the place is essentially a motel. When I first got to my room, I realized that there was a gap between the door and the door frame - my room could be unlocked by slipping a plastic card into the gap! When they gave me another room, the door to the new room had signs of a crowbar being used on it and the main locking plate (on the door frame) was completely loose. Given the very poor quality of the place, the two terrible rooms, and signs of crowbar damage, I asked for a refund and got out of there. Listen to my review and the multitude of other reviews; just don't stay there.",0
23338,"OH MY GOD.... Stay away!!!!! Run as fast as you can the place is FILTHY. The first thing that came to mind when I checked in is the show ""Hotel Impossible"" its exactly what feature those type of ""hotels"" I dont have a clue why its called Hotel its beyond a zero star motel.   Where do I start, the place is smelly, damp and dirty. The furniture is broken and and the carpet is  torn and has nails sticking out.  I was petrified to touch the bed, scared of bed bugs. The towels were EWWW and had hair and other..  I would never ever recommend this even to my worst enemy. The people at the front desk probably live there.  Shame on expedia for having such a place listed on their site.  Unless you are homeless and or utterly poor Do Not come near this place.  Its independently owned by people who couldnt care less about the experience, cleanliness or anything else.",0
23357,"Upon our arrival we were given a room that the deadbolt didn't work, no way to secure the door without it, called the front desk and they got us into another room. I do give them credit for that but I suspect they knew the lock didn't work and tried the deadbolt on our new room before we got the key to the new room. I parked my car outside of the hotel on their property and thought it would be safer to park my car in their covered garage parking that is attached to the hotel. Someone busted out the entire back windshield of my car. Nothing was taken, don't know if it was just malicious or if someone walked in on them or what, but I had a half gallon of vodka on my back seat in a bag and that wasn't taken. I asked the front desk clerk if they have security cameras and her response is ""They haven't installed them yet"". Here I thought by moving my car to the garage parking would leave my car less exposed and it was the complete opposite. The hotel front desk clerk stated that they are not liable for the cars or damage. If I lived in Chicago I would sue them because I don't buy that. So as I paid my $400 plus bill for 2 nights I had to drive home to Detroit 4 1/2 hours without a back windshield. They offered me no credit off of my hotel bill for the entire crappy experience at this hotel. Very sad that money and greedy profit takes precedence over your customers that obviously this owner doesn't care about.",0
23359,"This is in response to Mr. Eugene Baldwin, Manager at Chicago Lake Shore Hotel comments on my review at TripAdvisor. I believe it borders on belittling and aggressive tactics; it appears as though management at Chicago Lake Shore Hotel may be guilty of gender discrimination. Consider yourselves warned ladies; this may not be a good location for a girl’s weekend.  I did contact LaQuinta before writing my reviews. LaQuinta asked management at Chicago Lake Shore Hotel to contact me, twice now they chosen not to.   214gene, Manager at Chicago Lake Shore Hotel, responded to this review, yesterday (7/3/15)  “Thank you for your review. There are plenty of non-seafood options at the so-called seafood buffet., from beef and chicken dishes to salads and desserts. Bars are loud. What can we say? The rooms are being renovated--not soon enough for you.”  The menu at Chicago Lake Shore Café does not specify there are more choices on the buffet than seafood. It is billed as the Seafood Buffet, not the “So-called Seafood Buffet”. That’s the Friday night offering in the café, patrons cannot order off the menu. It is painfully obvious that Mr. Baldwin’s forte is not food service; otherwise he would understand dietary restrictions and cross condemnation concerns.  “As to bars are loud. What can we say?” – the last two available tables were in front of an audio system (aka boombox), which had been placed on a table. He did not address the server’s attitude or the fact that a reunion was in progress or the bar was not well stocked for the weekend events.  Obviously management believes it is ok to charge full price for rooms that lack amenities due to renovations. Renovations are not mentioned on any booking sites; one must read the reviews to find out that little gem. Again no apology for lack of security on doors or lighting or gnats in a room. As to renovating, that’s not my problem; I paid for a room that should have been completed.",0
23361,"On at least 3 separate occasions, a guy has approached me to buy drugs.  He roamed the hallway and would lurk on the street.  I reported him to the hotel staff, but they did nothing.  I even gave them the color, make, and model of the car he was driving.  Bubkus.  This hotel is a drug hotel.",0
23362,"Our experience at this hotel was very similar to ""kiwicj55"". We didn't have to move from room to room and we didn't have the leak, but all the other points written about were the same as we experienced.  * Shower water in bath wouldn't drain away for a couple of hours, staff at front desk were uninterested when told * No refrigerator  * No microwave * Laundry bag & checklist to be filled in were hanging in the closet, but no staff member could tell us how to use the system, they denied that bags were in the room * The pool they proudly talk about in their advertising was empty &  lined with construction black plastic.... This is summer time, with no pool. * No lights in the stair well outside our room * Wifi was intermittent   Only stay at this hotel if it is the last choice available in the city.",0
23364,"Do not stay in this hotel unless you are really desperate.  When we arrived we were appalled to see that a large part of the hotel was being renovated and had scaffolding and plastic sheets all over it. Our room was behind the scaffolding and had opaque construction plastic covering the window so you could not see out.  We booked six months in advance and were confirmed a non-smoking room. The hotel's website says ""guaranteed 100% smoke-free rooms"". When we got to our room, it reeked strongly of stale smoke. Went back to reception to complain. It appeared they didn't believe us so we got one of the staff to accompany us to the room. He admitted it did smell.  They said they were fully booked and there was nothing they could do to change our room. I politely but very firmly stood my ground. In total they told us three times that they were fully booked. In the end they found us another room that did not smell - so they were not fully booked and were trying to fob us off.  That night it rained heavily and water poured down the inside of the window, onto the sill and flowed down into the top of the aircon unit sitting under the window and onto the carpet on the floor. Water was also running in through the ceiling itself above the aircon. A good part of the carpet was completely wet and squishy underfoot in the morning. I was concerned that the aircon unit would fuse or short-out and become an electrical hazard so we had to turn it off. This room was also behind the scaffolding and had plastic over the window.  We had to wait for the manager to arrive before anyone was able to address our problem. We were allocated a third room. Despite our confirmation and their website saying the room would have a refrigerator and a microwave, it did not. The light above the sink basin did not work so it was difficult to see what you were doing in the bathroom mirror.  This was easily the worst hotel experience we have ever had. One or two of the staff were good, most were totally hopeless - did not know things or did not want to help. For example, there was a laundry bag in our room with a blank list that could be completed. We asked how the system worked. They said ""We don't have a laundry service"". We said ""But there's a bag in our room"". Them: ""Dunno about that - but we don't have a laundry service"".  I could write a lot lot more about this place (eg the three inches of water all along the walkway payment right outside the doors when it rained which would not drain away) but this is long enough already.  Do not go near this place - it's just dreadful.",0
23365,"When I pulled up to this hotel, I was horrified to find it under a matrix of scaffolding. When I made reservations at the hotel, nowhere had it been mentioned that the hotel was under construction (being converted to a La Quinta).  This would be fine if it resulted in a discounted price, but it didn't.  They still charged me full price.  So, where to start with my problems with this place?  It might be easier if I just listed them off: - As we were in Chicago for a reunion, our family had reserved 5 separate rooms several months before. For some reason, they were unable to give us our rooms a convenient distance from each other. Instead we were scattered in different sections of the hotel. - The water in one of these rooms ran brown, with sediments. After running it for a while, it still didn't run clear. So, we had to buy bottled water for our rooms. The hotel didn't even provide these for us. We had to go to a grocery store a mile away and buy them ourselves. - There was a major puddle outside the door of one of our rooms. What did the hotel do to help us get ourselves and our things past the puddle and into our rooms?  Laid  down three pieces of plywood, which we were expected to hop from one to another until we were across the puddle. Like a frog hopping across lily pads on a pond. - The drain of both the sink and the tub in one of our rooms weren't functioning, so bother had standing water in the sink for a day. - The renovations being done left exposed, unshaded lights right outside our windows, which shined into our rooms all night. - Some of the staff was tremendously unhelpful and impolite. When I asked how long it would take to get to O'Hare airport, I was told that it would take me 2 hours! When I checked on Google Maps, and it told me 40 minutes, this staff member rolled her eyes at me and told me to ""believe who I want"".  Hands down the worst hotel experience I've ever had. Good luck La Quinta!!!",0
23371,"Hotel under maintainance-reception desk provisional in a small and fullpacked room. Never have seen a Hotel in such bad conditions. They should be Closed during maintaince. Even 1 Dollar per night were too much. Stayed 2 hours and left on the same day. Neighbourhood looks scary.  Managment ok, refund my booking totally. Thanks therefore.",0
23372,"I booked to stay here for my graduation/family vacation. I can't stress enoughabout how unsafe this place is. The fact that it's a ""hotel"" is misleading, this is worse than motels I've stayed at. It is under construction, and that's not advertised anywhere on their website or for my booking. I stayed here for 3 nights and complained to the front desk to which they always say the ""manager is not available"". I have left messages both in person and on the phone for Lydia, the manager to get a refund and she has not contacted me back. It was obvious that she was avoiding me because customer representatives of Expedia was able to get through to Lydia. The construction was loud and my room was INSIDE a construction site that clearly violated both fire codes and workplace safety codes.",0
23377,"This was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. It is right by a very busy highway. Part of the hotel, which looks like a two-story prefab, is being remodeled so you are in the middle of a construction site. The screens on the window, which looked onto a car park, were broken. We asked for a non smoking room but when we arrived it reeked of old cigarette smoke. When I asked the assistant at the desk if we could change to a non smoking room he said we would have to wait until the next day when the manager was there. We were only there for one more night so I didn't bother.Of greatest concern was the lack of security. The lock on the main hotel door that opened onto a staircase that led up to our room was broken, so there was essentially no security in the middle of a dangerous neighborhood. I will NEVER go back to that hotel.",0
23378,"TL/DR: Reception poor and disorganized, hotel in very poor condition (being renovated), location not convenient to public transportation.  Would advise spending a bit more money and staying somewhere in the loop and taking Metra, CTA or cab (<15$) to get to Hyde Park.  Rooms, however, seemed clean if you don't care about the rest.  I'm a pretty low brow reviewer, check my other hotel reviews for reference... The hotel is in a fairly convenient location to Hyde Park/University of Chicago but not close to any public transportation, and not really convenient walking distance to UChicago.  The hotel is under construction right now; it looks like it may have been acquired by La Quinta and is being brought up to their ""style"" and ""standards,"" but for now, the hotel is in shambles.  Construction is continually taking place outside the guest room windows (construction workers working right out side the windows at 7-8AM on weekends).  The newer building looks like it would be nice, but we weren't able to get a room in there. Instead, we were given a room in the old building which reeked of cigarettes.  The hotel was kind enough to give us a new room that didn't smell (as badly) after some grumbling.  Reception was hard to find (and in a re-purposed guest room while the lobby is under construction).  When we arrived for the 9 AM check-in that we requested, we had to (literally) climb over garbage on the floor to get to the ""reception"" room.  Reception was filthy and a cleaning person was literally scrubbing a toilet in the attached bathroom while we were trying to check in.  We were told (after filling out a form to request 9 AM check-in) that we could not get early check-in and would have to return at 3 to get our room.  I understand not having early check-in, but it was requested before arrival, so we'd have appreciated being told it wasn't possible before we planned around it.  At 11 AM the same day we got a text denying our early check-in request... Would've been nice the day before.  At any rate, the room we eventually got was very old, but seemed clean.  We considered finding a new hotel, but figured we'd already sunk the money in on a pre-paid room, so we learned our lesson. Once the hotel is no longer under construction, location will still not be convenient, but the other complaints likely won't hold.",0
23397,Booked the hotel for business travel for a single day. I pre checked if I can do early check in and the booking staff confirmed. Upon arrival and after they charged my card they informé dme that tbe room is not available and that I will have to wait for 5 hrs or pay full rate for a room that was not confirmed. I already paid 3 times the average price because of the season. This is not acceptable and totally misguided from ten staff. The manager in duty at the night shift was extermly not ready to handle the simple situation. They refused to refund me. Horrible service and The reception staff was absolutely non cooperative.  I would never recommend this hotel for any level of stays let alone business stay.,0

23815,"Hello I was in Milan for my wife's birthday and stayed at the hotel.  Me and my wife took the shuttle service provided my the hotel to the Dumo as we were going the driver provided us with a map and pickup location for the ride back.  He told us to wait by the corner across from Fendi furniture store. Upon finishing our diner we decided to go earlier than the pickup time and wait for the shuttle to come. It was a rainy night.  We waited but the shuttle never came, I texted the hotel and was assured a couple of times that the shuttle will be there his name was ""mateo"" , then at the end he said that no shuttle is available. I tried to get an uber and a taxi for an hour and half and was not successful. The hotel phone does not work and had a store employee (we sheltered in from the rain) call from his cell and also said the hotel phone does not work. We were stuck in the rain my wife was very tired and decided to walk back. it was awful during the way no taxi will stop nor was available. I was angry and disappointed when we got to the hotel I confronted Mateo and felt like he ruined our vacation and my wife's birthday.  the next day I found out that the bellman said that pickup locations are not finalized and the hotel is working on new maps.  I was so angry that miscommunication and bad management resulted in the worst night we ever experienced.  I do not recommend this hotel .",0
23824,"We're staying in the hotel now, so this is being written in real time.  Simply stated, this hotel is a disgrace. In our room a portion of the wall covering is torn and actually missing, the carpet is badly stained, the bathroom floor is filthy (I can't imagine when it was last cleaned), and the bathroom door does not shut--the door is so misaligned that it does not fit into the door frame, remaining open. It has obviously been this way for a while, betraying management's attitude toward guests.  We've stayed in grand hotels all over the world. We anticipated a similar experience. Instead, we were charged for a very expensive, very poorly maintained third-class room. Photos are available.  Avoid at all costs. ",0
23995,I had booked the room on Booking.com It's central location & modern appearance were the deciding factors. I had asked for an early check in as we were going to a matinee and wanted to change out of our travelling clothes. Having received an email confirmation stating that the hotel could accommodate this  I assumed it was ok. We got to the hotel and were told categorically that it was a 3pm check in and that a trainee had made a mistake! Even when the receptionist was reading the email on my phone he would not budge. A manager was called who really had a couldn't care less attitude. We asked if there was an unmade room where we could change and were offered the public toilet as a suggestion. After much fuss we were offered an alternative room without a window which we took as by this time we needed to get to the theatre. We both gasped when we opened the door to the room as it was not much bigger than the bed. We had to take it in turns to open our small cases and my companion's feet touched the wall at the bottom of the bed - there was no space round three sides. Add to that the staff identity card and lanyard tucked down inside the bed and dirty tissues on top of the aircon unit it didn't add up to a pleasant stay! As the aircon switched off with the lights we tried to sleep with the light on as there was only a tiny bathroom extract vent. at an extortionate cost of £202!,0
24001,"False advertising and really poor customer services. Booked a Z Queen for a bit more space and was given the standard smallest room. I have stayed in lots of small boutique compact hotels but this was bad because the room was not as advertised. When speaking to staff to ask for the room we booked, Philip on the front desk and his manager couldn’t have cared less and were more interested in trying to educate me on what a compact hotel is. I’ve stayed in places like citizenM Tower of London Hotel and the difference here is the rooms are as advertised and the staff are amazing. To pay £295 for one night and pay the extra for a Queen and get the smallest room is a complete rip off.",0
24086,"This was a bad experience, we booked this hotel on Meituan in the early morning, when we arrived at the hotel, the front desk told us that there was no room, which made me wonder why we could book this hotel on the software since there was no room. The front desk asked us to cancel the order by ourselves, but the order showed that it could not be cancelled, and asked us to call the customer service of the software in the wee hours of the morning, which was difficult to get through to the customer service. Then the front desk finally gave us a room, but with black water coming out of the toilet at three in the morning and the air conditioning smelling of paint at five in the morning, I found it hard to believe it was a proper hotel. What I went through that night was painful.",0
24223,"Avoid the first floor suite.  There is a constant noise overhead — all day, all night.

24690,"I stayed for 3 nights in room 203.   Cons: The main PROBLEM is that the closed shower cubicle leaks A LOT of water. You always have to put some towels on the floor, which helps a little. Even if you don't use the second shower above your head and just use the small one and very carefully, it still leaks! It's DANGEROUS, because everything in the bathroom has very sharp edges like BLADES and you can accidentally FALL and seriously INJURY yourself. Last night I woke up at 3am because of a MOSQUITO bite. Maybe the mosquito got in through the ventilation shaft, or maybe the cleaners didn't close the door while I was away. I always close doors quickly to AVOID insects. There is no insect repellent  in the room. Windows are DIRTY and locked (no handles). No way to open them with bare hands.  Telephone buttons to contact reception don't work properly. Time wasted trying to get it to work and contact reception. (Instructions for next guests: press ""operator"" button and wait). A light bulb has a flickering problem.  Information on CTRIP is incorrect. Breakfast ends at 10:00, not 10:30.  The air conditioner is half broken and has a life of its own. All you can do is just turn it on or off. So the choice is very cold or very hot, you can't adjust it. If you set the temperature to 26 C, it drops to 21 C after half a minute . The option to control the airflow (1/2/3) doesn't change anything, but the display tells you that it's been changed.  I noticed later that one of the 2 bottles of water supplied was already open and not full, but I didn't drink it and opened it. How is this possible? Why would you give your guests water that has already been opened? There is a slight smell of smoke in the room. As for me, I have never smoked, so I have a good sense of such things. There is a lot of noise every morning, people are loud.  Pros: The receptionist and the chef can speak English. Breakfast is good. Just get there early as the food is out of stock, if you go to the canteen at the end, especially bread. There is a fridge, locker, electric kettle and hairdryer. Wi-Fi quality is good. You can watch a film online without getting 'connection lost' messages. A good supply of toiletries (toothbrush, soap, tea and coffee bags, sugar, tissues, slippers, toilet paper) is provided daily on request, no questions asked. The water in the toilet is a deep blue. I guess it's for cleaning. A ""Mainland China - Hong Kong"" plug adapter was provided on request. You can leave your suitcase for a while after checking out. In case you need to do something to do and pick it up later.  Extra: After checking out, I found out that the hotel also offers a bus service.   I hope my review was helpful. Hope to hear from you soon.  我在203房间住了3晚。  缺点：主要问题是封闭的淋浴间漏水很多。你总是不得不在地板上放一些毛巾，这有一点帮助。即使你不使用头顶上的第二个淋浴器，而只是非常小心地使用小的淋浴器，它仍然会漏水！这很危险，因为它可能会影响你的生活！这很危险，因为浴室里的所有东西都有非常锋利的边缘，就像刀片一样，你可能会不小心摔倒，严重伤害到自己。 昨晚我在凌晨3点醒来，因为被蚊子咬了。也许是蚊子从通风口进来的，或者是清洁工在我离开时没有关门。我总是迅速关门以避免昆虫。房间里没有驱虫剂。窗户很脏，而且锁着（没有把手）。没有办法用手打开它们。 联系前台的电话按钮不能正常工作。试图让它工作并联系接待处的时间被浪费了。(给下一位客人的指示：按 ""接线员 ""按钮并等待）。灯泡有闪烁的问题。 CTRIP上的信息是不正确的。早餐在10:00结束，而不是10:30。 空调是半坏的，有自己的生命。你能做的只是把它打开或关闭。所以选择是很冷或很热，你无法调整。如果你把温度设置为26摄氏度，半分钟后就会降到21摄氏度 。控制气流的选项（1/2/3）不会改变任何东西，但显示屏告诉你它已经被改变。 后来我注意到，提供的2瓶水中有一瓶已经打开，没有装满，但我没有喝，而是打开了。这怎么可能呢？为什么要给客人已经开过的水？ 房间里有一股轻微的烟味。至于我，我从来没有抽过烟，所以我对这种事情的感觉很好。每天早上都有很多噪音，人们很吵。  优点是： 接待员和厨师能说英语。早餐很好。只是要早点去，因为食物是缺货的，如果你在最后去食堂，特别是面包。有冰箱、储物柜、电水壶和吹风机。Wi-Fi质量很好。你可以在线观看电影，而不会收到 ""连接丢失 ""的信息。每天根据要求提供充足的洗漱用品（牙刷、肥皂、茶叶和咖啡袋、糖、纸巾、拖鞋、卫生纸），没有任何问题。厕所里的水是深蓝色的。我猜这是用来清洁的。根据要求提供了一个 ""中国大陆-香港 ""的插头转换器。退房后，你可以把你的行李箱放一会儿。以防你需要做一些事情来做，以后再来取。  额外的： 退房后，我发现该酒店还提供巴士服务。  我希望我的评论是有帮助的。希望能尽快收到你的来信。",0

You can't help but leave this hotel feeling like you've been systematically worked over for every single cent, whilst leaving you feeling hungry and disappointed. ....oh, the rooms are OK!!  ",0
25372,"Paid over $400 for 1 person per room on club lounge floor. Upon checkin, we asked to be given quiet room away from noise, elevators, etc. .but we were given the noisiest room possible next to the club lounge entry and we could hear all the noise from the lounge kitchen staff clanking into our room and the guest traffic conversation noise entering and exiting the lounge next to our room, plus the loud ground lobby music and other noise echoing throughout the center hollow of the building, which is a bad building design, terrible for people who don't want to hear every clanking noise magnified and echoing in the hotel into their room. When we asked for a quieter located room later, we were told there was no other room available, which based on the staff's future behavior and the number of empty tables in the club lounge we found very unlikely. In addition, the initial check in process was longer, more tiring and complicated than most other hotels of any quality and we've experienced thousands of different hotel qualities. We don't appreciate having a big camera in our face at check in as if we are criminals being processed before our imprisonment, in addition to the extra time waiting for the staff to photocopy our passports while other staff are also working on the copier making us sit and wait like criminals. At least the staff offered us a cup of tea while waiting for the staff to ""process our check in"", and we thought an English hotel like the Langham would at least be able to make a decent cup of tea in China, but it was a terrible quality tea, worse than a gas station, which we would later find all the foods in this Langham hotel to be of extremely low quality also. Really, a Ramada hotel even in Shunde would be a 3 star Michelin compared to the sad awful quality of Langham hotel food. We also overheard other guests in club lounge complaining about the Italian restaurant on the Lobby as also very disappointing and expensive. One of the major reasons we booked this hotel is because we thought Langham hotel would have good or at least decent quality food, but it was so disappointing and low in quality we want this review to let everyone know how cheap, bad and cheating this hotel is with their food quality and other issues. The breakfast morning juices were not only pored from a very low quality plastic juice bottle, but later pored back into the plastic bottle from the breakfast dispensers. Really the quality of the food/drink was such low quality, it might as well had been garbage the next day, but with very expensive prices. See pictures. Normally we never drink alcohol, really very seldom, but one day we asked for a cup of wine, but the staff responded with . .""Our evening cocktails finished 5 minutes ago."" Like we say. .  The staff treat their $400 per night paying guests like scum convicts.. One day we went to the lobby to use the gym and the sauna, and we asked the staff for a cup of ice, and instead of calling the restaurant or telling us how we can get some ice, the gym hostess responded with . .""We can not give you ice"" with a smile. We had to ask for the manager, because it's simply insane for any hotel staff of any quality to resist providing some ice, not to mention in a $400+ a night hotel. The manager finally came and apologized for the gym attendants behavior and gave us a cup of ice. We wanted to use the pool, but it was only big enough for 2 people and always full when we wanted to use it before it closes in the evening. If it wasn't for the proximity of this hotel to the Canton Fair, we would be hesitant to spend $10 per night in this hotel. We stayed here for 7 nights and several nights we were awoken by ambulance or police sirens from the street and we were on the top floor, so we imagine the lower floors were louder. The room itself was clean, but really very cheap like IKEA furniture. We are only 5ft. 8"" tall but we could not stretch out our legs in the bath tub. It was a bathtub for a child, not relaxing at all for an average sized adult. This hotel was a 1 star hotel, but extremely expensive, with poorly trained staff etiquette, disgraceful food worth nothing, and extremely cheap quality room, furnishings and bathroom.",0
25502,We booked 2 rooms back in October 2022 to stay at the Hide in May 2023.  The hotel cancelled one of our rooms because they needed it for someone else!!  BEWARE!!  Very disappointed we had to find another hotel at last minute and pay extra.  I can’t even explain first trip to London very sad…,0
25587,Didn’t have the physical card we booked with so couldn’t charge that. Had no idea there were forms. Tried to do it but the staff were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. We spent 45 minutes there only for it not to work! They did not help at all! Had to charge it to a different card. I will absolutely never come back and urge anyone visiting Hyde Park or UChicago to not come to this hotel. ,0
25606,"Don't book your stay here. It's nonrefundable. Even if you call a day after you make the reservation and just want to modify the dates, they will charge you a $600+ penalty if they can't modify the reservation (b/c no rooms are available for your modified dates).  Even if your arrival date is not for an entire month.  These are unfair business practices. I've never been to a hotel that doesn't allow you to cancel a reservation so long as there's plenty of time until the check-in date.  Also, it's impossible to talk to the management of Sophy Hyde Park -- i.e., a real live human being. They do everything possible to redirect you to an outside planning agency.  Disgraceful! Just to be clear, I haven't stayed there as of the day of this writing.  I just wanted to report very unfair booking practices.",0
25884,"I called them to reserve a room. I was told there is only one room available and  after we agreed, they would keep my reservation untill 23:59. I accepted.   When we were on the way, another staff callled me and told me ""sorry your room is cancelled. But I am glad you didnt face this problem on the way to hotel or upon arrival. Fortunately I informed you earlier. Sorry"" and hung up the phone.   It seems this hotel is managed by poor managment and staff is poorly educated. As an airline crew member, I was highly unpleasand and this was something unexpected from Wyndham hotels.",0
25885,"What a complete waste of what could be a great hotel.  6 of us arrived at mid afternoon, we had pre-booked our rooms.  First impression was not good, the reception, lobby bar and dining room were icy cold. There appeared to be no heating on. The two reception staff looked frozen too. The first thing explained was not to touch the heating control panel in our rooms. There was no-one to carry our bags or show us to our rooms. The rooms themselves were perfectly fine, large, clean, spacious with comfortable beds. What one would expect for the high price we paid. We waited for the heating to start. We were told no evening food was available, we would have to arrange ourselves. If we didnt have a Turkish speaker with us it would have been a nightmare. As we were so cold we called reception for two large whiskies.  I was told no room service, I must go down to the bar. I did but was told no alcohol until 4:30.  We all went down at 5pm. There was only one young woman to deal with the bar and checking in what appeared to be the only 6 other guests saying in the hotel. My friend and myself did not get our drinks for two hours since we originally asked. When we asked to pay we were astonished to discover two large whiskies were 275 TL about £27. I could by a litre bottle of the same for that price. Our Turkish friend ordered food from outside to be delivered to our rooms, he also brought alcohol from outside as the prices were so extortionate in the hotel. The temperature in our rooms kept rising to the point of being uncomfortable. It was impossible to sleep as the room was so hot, all the windows had been fixed so they couldn't be opened. As we had been on the road since 2am, we needed sleep but we simply couldn't because of the heat. Having only one female member of staff fo a hotel this size, was frankly ridiculous. Had there been an emergency she would not have coped, so it made our stay dangerous too. I would never recommend this hotel ever. Completely inefficient, staff seemed totally unprofessional and it was a very unpleasant stay. The included breakfast was just about  adequate, the 12 of us guests all sat there in our jackets it was so cold. We could not wait to leave.",0
25889,"Room is in very bad condition. Sink doesn't work. Toilet cover seat was flaged as cleaned but there were stains. The bath mixer's handle was broken.

As we got in our taxi, a member of staff came running out to tell me I had to go back in.  I was then told I could not leave until the mini bar was checked!!!!  It was a hugely embarrassing situation and the taxi was waiting and the costs increasing. After an interminable wait I was told that I could go as NOTHING had been used.

Out of order or not maintained at all. No one cares.  We came for 2 weeks for business trip.   Please never consider this location at any point of time if you expect what is being said   Thanks",0
26928,"Room was exceptionally small - could barely sit on toilet and not have leg hit toilet paper roll.  Barn door for bathroom since it could not accommodate a regular sized door.  Closet could barely fit two suits and 4 shirts, let alone my wife's clothes. No mouthwash or other standard accessories.  Room was on second floor directly above bar which was noisy all weekend.  The room size is not as advertised, No chairs on balcony.  Most expensive in Austin but felt like I was staying at a Sheraton or the like.  Many other choices in Austin so avoid this.  Restaurant also not up to Four Season standards with few choices, flavorless food, tables too close, and wine that was stored poorly and had too much dement from fragmented cork (over $250 for the bottle).  I stay at Four Seasons, Peninsula, Shangri La and Mandarin Hotels and so expect top service form these class of establishments and Austin Four Seasons was not at all up to standards.  ",0
26945,"This cannot be a Four Seasons hotel! We had a 400 people conference and the hotel fell short on practically every front:  - meeting rooms:  we asked for a masking tape early morning and repeatedly asked for it again all day. Until 6pm when we needed the meeting, it never came!  It is great to replace the glasses during the lunch break but only if you replace them with the same number of glasses and not about half the number !! It is mere negligence !   - restaurants:  There is only one restaurant and one bar area!! At the Four Seasons ?!  We went to the restaurant slightly before 10pm after our meetings for a very unpleasant hostess to tell us from very far that the restaurant is closed. At 10pm?! Seriously? When we started leaving, another hostess came after us inviting us to the restaurant and when we went in, please we’re still dining ... no comment!  Breakfast is a short one pager! What happened to the famous Four Seasons breakfast buffets?   - training :  When we ask for fresh orange juice the standard response is “we could offer this but at a higher rate than what is in the menu” ....   - room lighting:  If you want to have light, you need to go to every single unit and light it!!! Never heard of a master lighting button?   To be fair, the check in was smooth with Levi who was professional and welcoming.

I wanted to book a room at a corporate rate for my wedding anniversary,I was told that they couldn't offer a room at this rate!So there were rooms available but the hotel just wasn't willing to accept guests, who don't pay the full price. I see, so am I to understand that the corporate rate is only offered when it suits the hotel, not when it actually suits me to stay there?What nonse. Don't advertise corporate rates if you're going to act like this.

27212,"Our five nights stay was nothing like the previous stay at the other Shangri-La Horizon Club, which an unfortunate encounter with an untrained staff almost ruined the last legs of three weeks vacation in China. Our lake-view room has a nice view of the lake; we really didn’t spend too much time in the room. We had breakfast twice at the Club lounge; nice decor with average service. In all fairness, if the Horizon Club employee had adhered the proper protocol and behaved professionally, I would give the premises a four star or even a five star review. Although the management did attempt to remedy the situation in an expeditious manner, but the initial approach was bit amateurish. We really appreciated what Ms. Lim had done for us on the day of our departure, however, the attempt couldn’t change our negative perception of this establishment. In all fairness, this is nice Shangri-La hotel located in a scenic spot, but the encounter at Horizon Club diminished our initial expectation of a great vacation. A genuine smile and a subtle yet warm gesture would have had a long lasting effects on the guests, which this premies obviously lack of. Overall, it was a disappointing and an awkwardly stay at this Shangri-La. Unlike the memorable anniversary we had in Prague last year, this particular stay is reminisce of Cold War era movie and we were the guests at a East Berlin hotel.",0

To 8th.  We had reserved a Junior Suite with Lounge access almost 6 months prior to our arrival with prepayment of more than $700/US dollars. Reserved , check in on Oct. 3rd. 21 to Oct. 6 th. 21. With delay by Delta Airline due to mechanical problems, we arrived at the hotel at 2.30AM. on Oct. 4th. Very rude awakening, we were told that we were “upgraded”, we told at the reception we did not request upgrade, we were told that the reserved suite was not available. A person at the reception desk took us through the alley way to a small elevator of Park Inn, did not even help with luggage even with 2 level of stairs. He opened the elevator, we said we do not want to go there, we would like to have our reserved room. He handed the key and said to make a left turn on 2nd. Floor and we will find the room and left. No courtesy of showing the room, amenities, or availability of services such as breakfast, we did not have breakfast next day, no idea where the breakfast area or the service was provided for us. Next day attempted come in to main hotel lobby, we were obstructed at the walk way from the Inn, were told we were not allowed. We were also told the executive lounge was closed, although we had access through our reservation. On Oct. 6 th.

Once being inside one of the units - shockingly filthy on the walls and realizing what that could be, didn't know how to get out quicker.... Seems toilet visits involve other activities as well, but cleaning the walls after some people had fun is obviously not very important to this particular hotel. In our opinion, not at all fitting with the pretended high standards of the Radisson chain of hotels.  Which one would expect from a five star hotel.   I posted my review via the rating site of Google. Got a standard answer from the management reassuring us how important is the cleanliness and well-being of the guests and asking for the chance to improve. Also inviting us to see that measures were taken. By coincidence we actually went back to Radisson a few days later. Found same toilet in the same filthy state. NO MEASURES TAKEN WHATSOEVER!!! Come on people, seriously? Empty words and promises from management, same dirt in the same place. Pity I can't hereby post the pictures.... Do I have to take the manager by his/her hand and show the dirt all by myself?? UNBELIEVABLE ! The motto of this Radisson  management seems to sound like ""not mine, don't care, people book anyway"".

29024,"Summary:  I’ve been staying at Marriott properties and other hotels for over 30 years and I’ve seen some tasty things, but the lack of housekeeping standards at the W Hotel Chicago was the grossest experience I've had. On top of that, the lack luster management response was disappointing.   Detail: I’ll start off by taking some responsibility. I was in a hurry, traveling on business when I booked the hotel. I didn’t take the time I normally do to look at reviews. If I did, I would have discovered Marriott’s own website only gives it a 3.4 out 5. And only 57% people on say they recommend staying at the property. Trip Advisor has it rated as #140 out of 205 hotels. If I had done my homework, these would have been red flags to tell me to go elsewhere!  My arrival started on a positive note, the check-in process was smooth. I received the complimentary upgrade because of my Marriott status. What was interesting is that when I asked about the suites, the front desk clerk said that it wouldn’t be worth using the Marriott suite certificates for this property. That was my first clue the hotel might not be as “luxury” as the W brand implies.   After a few previous bad experiences, I always check a few things before settle into a new room, including pull back the sheets to look for invited guests and to make sure they are clean. When I pulled back the sheets on both off the beds, I was disappointed to see one bottom sheets was stained. It looked like fresh lines, but the sheet was permanently stain. Since there was only one of me and the second bed linens looked clean, I wasn’t going to mention it and just sleep in the other bed.  Unfortunately, while pulling back the sheets I noticed the mattresses slid off. The problem there was no box-spring just a flat smooth particle board base. Since I’m a big guy, I knew this might be problem because without a box spring, you don’t have proper support. Sure enough, when I tested the bed, I sunk to the bottom.   I called down hoping they had a room without this poor setup, apparently all the rooms have this setup -- no box-springs. I asked for the manager who played dumb about the subject. She said this is first time “today” she has heard about it. I asked if she heard about before today and she no. What I find surprising is that I found multiple reviews on Marriott's own site that complained about the very problem. It would be odd for a manager at the hotel not to read reviews, assuming they care about customer feedback.   She called housekeeping, who suggested a wooden platform under the mattress to give me more support. I said that made no sense to add wood on top of wood. I said please just replace the mattress, assuming that current mattress was as dated as the room. Sure enough, when it the arrived with a replacement mattress was much thicker the existing ones, and although its life span will be reduced with a box spring, I looked like a better option.   At this point I sunk about 30 minutes into resolving the issue, but I felt I was making progress. Then I couldn’t believe what I saw (pictures attached). I saw a yellow stain on the side mattress that wasn't covered by the mattress pad, and when they took off the mattress pad, a large yellow stain (assuming urine) covered about a third of the mattress. This would have been plain to see by any housekeeper that made the bed!  I then asked them to take off the other pad from the other mattress, sure enough another large yellow stain (assuming urine)! Again, no housekeeper, no matter how poor their vision, could have missed it! Both stains looked as though they had been there a while. Possibly hundreds of guests had slept on these mattresses in this condition!   The housekeeper in the room did the right thing and called for another mattress. After almost losing my lunch at seeing what I could have sleep on, I was disappointed again watching the state of the clean sheets used to make up the beds. The housekeeper had brought more sheets than she needed, I then realized why.   About half the sheets had permanent stains on them, she discarded those and only used ones without stains. She complained that this is common, the laundry delivers them back this way. Unfortunately, I believe she took the permanently stained sheets and put them back in the dirty linen pile, and the cycle continued. Note, the housekeepers that made the bed before I arrived apparently decided to use stained sheets, while ignoring the stained mattresses.   After about an hour, I had two new mattresses in the room with unstained sheets. After explaining what happened to the front desk manager, she apologized and offered 15K in points and by me dinner. Frankly I was tired and didn’t feel like spending any more time on it and finally was able to focus on other things. The next day I had an email for 10K points (not 15K) I then realized that wouldn’t even get me a free night at the W. I believe that would be at least 45K. I’ve had far less gross experiences (broken box springs, poor meals, etc.) and typically Marriott and Hyatt properties offer enough points to cover a free night stay to make it up for the more experience.  At the end of the day, I suggest avoiding the is hotel. The guest rooms badly need a renovation. The only thing that comes close the “luxury” description was the $400 a night room charge. Even after it gets the renovation, if they continue to have such a low standard for housekeeping, I wouldn't return!",0

After I found out that the payment didn't proceed, I immediately settled the payment after they sent out the payment link for me to pay online and sent them the receipt.  Starting from this point, I've never received any emails from them, like thank you / sorry for my time, as it really takes a lot of time to deal with this, nor your payment was received.

When asked if the windows can be open so you can actually breath in your room, constantly denied because of this “Spanish law”. Mould covers entire shower ceiling and walls.

Would give negative stars if that were possible.",0

There are stains and food residue left on it. Air-conditioning was so cold that we have to find other table to avoid it. Over price for room service ( a can of TIGER beer 330ml cost $13+++ ) .  2.

Very disappointing for the price we paid!,0

30290,"Stayed here in room 310 for 2 night. We originally paid for a room with no window which we’ve stayed in twice before on previous occasions and both have been standard. However, this time we were offered to spend more at the reception to upgrade our room to a queen room with a window. When we got to this room it was all falling apart. With the aircon not Working and the dial for it halfway off the wall and cables falling out, that what was the first problem. We then proceeded to go in the bathroom and metal plate on the shower wall then fell off into the sink. We checked the bed and that was stained with tea. The sky remote buttons have been used so much that you can’t see the buttons. The aircon persisted to make a horrible noise throughout the night and flashing which woke us up many times. We took this upon ourselves to talk to the manager and get our money back because this was by far our worst stay. They palmed it off like it was nothing and offered 10% of for a next stay. We will not be staying here again. We asked if we could get our upgrade money back instead and they refused. We are highly disappointed with this chain seeing as we have stayed here before and the service was not dealt with correctly. I expect a refund",0
30357,"Absolutely horrible stay last night. Same complaints as the other one stars. I know they'll respond by saying they don't hide anything, but they also don't explicitly state that your room is a windowless, airless cupboard; the bed is pushed against three walls (meaning you have to crawl over your bedmate to go for a wee), and is surrounded by a horrible fabric cushioned panel you don't want to touch with your bare skin; you have to have the aircon on or you'll die, but it makes a terrible racket; the plumbing is a bit dodgy - fluctuating water temperature and pressure, and a slight whiff from the plughole; you pretty much have to have a crap in front of whoever is sharing with you (we've known each other long enough, but it's hardly what you want on a trip away); you need a manual to operate the light switches (the room is 6 foot by 8 foot for flip's sake - it only needs one light!); they've put a chair under the sawn off desk so you really have to put it out on the landing to avoid bashing in to it all the time; you can't both stand up in the room at the same time, much less get dressed; if you hang your stuff on the hooks behind the door it can be quite hard to open the door wide enough to get out; etc etc.  You'd think with it being so very small it'd be immaculate, but it isn't - not filthy, but I'd only give a 6 or 7 for cleaning. And it isn't cheap like they keep trying to make out. You can find much better deals elsewhere. Even the Premier Inns at Tower Bridge and Borough are better. They don't look so chic on the internet, but you'll get a better night's sleep and a much more satisfying bathroom experience, and just because they're on the South Bank you won't be all that far from the action.  I managed not to have a complete claustrophobia-induced panic attack, but spent a rather tense, sleepless night on a sloppy mattress wondering how quickly we'd perish in a fire. Glad to be home and looking forward to bed.",0

30940,"This was by far one of the worst stays I have experienced staying in a “Resort”. This is coming from someone who stays in a 100 different hotels per year.   First the pictures that are displayed I have no idea where they received them from because it does not look like as advertised. The waterpark was so over crowded that you could barely walk and finding a chair was never going to happen. They must have forgotten that you actually have to do upkeep when it comes to anything dealing with water. Just think you pay $24 a day for a “Resort Fee” for this.   Second the actual other parts of the hotel could really use a facelift. I could go on and on, but it was so bad we checked out 3 hours into our stay and went to another hotel.  If that is not bad enough I do not know what else to really tell you.",0

I did so, and then they couldn’t find them and now they think they have them but they can’t give them to me because the one person with keys isn’t here. All failed to mention when I told them I was getting something important. Needed something fro my daughter and  paid express delivery and the front desk never told me it was up there and now they also don’t know where it is or “can’t get it”. “Sorry” is what I get.

The ladies at the front desk were disrespectful, and very rude, made me feel I was lying, not professional at all. Because they didn't trust me, I ask the security to check on the camera, they didn't do it, no one ever called us. We waited 3 hours in our room and clearly waisted my Sunday afternoon in Chicago, and no one cared. I went back to the front desk, and all a sudden one of the lady finally found a new room for us.

We were told thos was not an issue and to leave our bag where we could find it.  I wasn't comfortable, but we had places to be.   We return at just before midnight and go to check in and grab our bag.  The bag is nowhere to be found.  We are told security took it because they were concerned and it's secure.  While checking in security brings the bag, they then ask us to prove it ours, which we have no way of doing because we don't have a luggage tag or receipt.    T this point I get aggravated and tell them to just give me my bag.  The woman at the front desk decided she is going to cancel my reservation and not givee a room for being rude.  I ask if she is refunding the cost and was told no, you need to deal with your credit card who you booked through.

Just the rudest and surly front desk I have ever seen. We were PUNISHED with the worst possible room because we asked politely about a doorman. Upon entering the main entrance there was NO ONE around - no front desk no help. I had to ask a guest who was walking out where the front desk was - on the Second Floor!. The two women at the desk were not happy to be there. Not allowed to check in until 4PM and no where to secure our luggage. The lobby was piled high with other peoples luggage.

Do not and I repeat do not stay at this hotel! As a well versed travel. International resident, travel agency owner and so much more I must say this was one of the worst stays I have haven’t had. Beware!!! The only good this WAS the location. It’s supposed to be a non smoking hotel, there was smoking both weed and cigarettes you could smell it. Staff untrained and kept making the excuses of “I’m new” from the time of check in throughout my stay I was constantly lied to, incorrectly charged, waited over 2 hours in my room just for clean linen and towels causing me to miss a shoot for work because the front desk told me if I wasn’t physically in my room they would NOT send anything up. The room upon check in still had some of another guest used items, upon reporting it the female at the front desk stated “it was hard to believe” They were extremely rude, disrespectful and total lack of customer service. I was given the wrong email twice for the GM and had to google who the GM and GM’s boss and history. I was also told that they don’t have on site managers by Michelle. In 7 days of a stay after being told the room wouldn’t be cleaned at all due to Covid they did it once after I took pictures of items that proved it was not cleaned fully from the last guest. And good look reaching anyone in housekeeping. Hope told me they were bringing needed items that took 2 hours and a second trip to the front desk. I do plan on forwarding this. I’ve stayed at weekly hotels that were better in service. Trust me do not spend your money here unless you like a less than quality stay.

I told him that the machine said approved but he insist that it did not. So i put my credit card for the second time and again machine said approved but again this guy siad no. This happened for 7 times with diffrent cards and everytime credit card machine said approved but this guy still said it did not. And he told me that he can't let me check inn. I was so mad. Got there after 12 hours flight and even i paid the room before he said that he can't let me check inn. Ihave opened my online banking app from my phone and it turns out he charged me 60 USD for 7 times. I showed it to him but he didn't even look at it he ignored me he was rude and annoying. I asked him to call the manager but he said that the manager will be there at 6 am. So finally he gave me my room key after charged my cards  for 7 times. I was going to stay there only for 2 days and i was going to shop for my kids but as he over charged my cards i lost my limits and bank blocked my cards. In the morning i've talked to the manager and she was a nice lady tried to help me but she couldn't i end up without shopping for my kids and 7 times 60 USD blocked on my cards.

NOT ACCEPTABLE for the room we received.   I asked desk person where I could purchase a 6 pack of beer. He told me I could not buy any alcohol past 11pm and that all Chicago bars and restaurants closed at 11pm. He said it was bc of the pandemic. I almost fainted as we came out to Chicago to visit friends and go out to eat, drink & be merry. I called my friend to find out this was a total fabrication.

I travel back to this hotel to speak to the manager regarding this issue and I was told by the front desk that the manager was in a meeting, then I was told the manager would not be available to speak with me.

31687,"Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of La Quinta.  I feel their quality has been in decline for many years.  However, I used Hotwire to get a cheap room for a quick trip to Austin, and when I saw I would be staying at a La Quinta, the first thing I did was to check TripAdvisor for their rating and reviews. Seeing the 4.5 overall rating and some complimentary recent reviews, I was feeling quite optimistic. While the address is in Austin, the hotel is located NNW of central Austin, so there is about a 20-25 minute drive into the downtown/Capitol/UT area, so keep that in mind.  For me, it was a convenient location for my needs on this trip. When I arrived, I received a friendly greeting and quickly was on my way to my room.  On entering, I noticed a musty, mildewy smell to it, but I assumed it would diminish after the AC was cranked up. On re-entering the room later that evening, I realized it had not faded, and it persisted throughout my visit. I can only assume that the AC filter had not been cleaned/changed in quite some time. The mildew smell was not the only problem with the room; it was definitely in need of some maintenance attention.  The bathroom sink was missing the stopper, and the wallpaper in the bedroom was peeling.  However, the most concerning issue was that the smoke detector was dangling from the ceiling by its wiring, and for whatever reason had been wrapped up in a plastic bag. I made the assumption that was the work of a frustrated prior guest, but nonetheless, it should never have been left in this condition.   While other visitors have had better experiences at this La Quinta, I was disappointed.",0
32014,"Spent 3 nights too long at Canggu Beach Hostel. The whole place is under construction and filled with pot holes, staff is unfriendly- besides our bartender! He's awesome   You pay a cheap price to stay, but at what price? It's far from Canggu city, must take expensive taxi. And there is river between hostel and beach bars so it's dangerous to go across after 4pm. This hostel is far from everything!!!   Outside food and alcohol are not allowed inside main house, because they want you to buy their over priced food and drinks. You can't use cash, only a credit card they give you (that charges 5,000rupia service fees for food&drink) I think it's a scam because you end up paying way more.   Restaurants in the area are also expensive unless you walk 15 minutes away from hostel (recommend Raza Warung-left out of hostel)    Hostel rooms are dirty, loud, and all the doors are broken (doors slam shut, swing open, don't lock..) a girl in my room asked to have clean sheets put on her bed because they weren't changed from previous guest ... when the staff came to the room he was drunk because he couldn't stand on bunk bed ladder without flailing all over the place and couldn't change the sheet- it was really strange   Way too expensive, all the 'freebies' are misleading and have catches!!   Stay in the actual Canggu city where you're close to nightlife, food, and can drink your own drank  ",0
32029,"I'll start by saying, I wouldn't reccommend this hostel. I'll elaborate on why:  -My partner got bitten by bedbugs all over her legs, feet and back! After reporting it, nothing was done about it other than stripping the bedsheets. She slept in my bed for the reminder of the stay to avoid further creepy crawleys. Avoid bed 8 downstairs main building!!  - The bathrooms were not cleaned as regularly as stated. Workers came and built dividers in our adjoining bathroom, leaving sawdust, tools, bamboo and general rubbish. This left it out of action for most of the time. The upstairs showers were low in water pressure.. but the worst thing to find was a used tampon in the shower. Something about the memory of streams of red around your feet before you notice why still gives me shivers. This was STILL there the next day!   -The hostel isn't best located, around Echo beach is much closer to all the other bars and restaurants. The hostel food is ok.. but there is way more choice and selection around Echo beach.  - Lots of staff... but not very efficient. Hands up to Ian behind the bar.. one guy working his socks off by himself! Even when it was really busy. 24 hour reception is not true.. one couple arrived at 12am and had been waiting for 3 hours before one of the other guests pointed them to a free bed (ironically bed 8.. the bedbug one)  - the socialising areas are a little restrictive compared to other hostels I've been to  There are some merits to the place though, the scooter hire is cheap and efficient, the drinks relatively cheap and food was ok (albeit variable in time to arrive)  ",0
32040,"- check in at 11pm was quiet fast done and organized..but there was no feeling of beeing welcomed. staff seemed unmotivated  - stayed in a 12 bedroom which is in a seperate house a few meters up the muddy street, as it was night u couldn't see anything walking up there because of the darkness.  - the room was quite smelly and not clean..specially the shower and toilet. The bed looked nice made up but it was full of sand.  - In the middle of the night an other girl wanted to climb in my bed while i was sleeping and told me its hers.. so the bed was double booked.  - when i got my luggage from the storageroom which ur not alowed to take in the rooms because to avoid the bedbugs (good idea) but after it was full of ants and other insects which were spread all over!  - breakfast was really good:)  - check out took ages! 45min. they wanted the towel back which i never got  - the place was crowded and seemed to be not under control anymore...there was just not enough space for so many people!  all in one i was very disappointed...  specially because i was reading all the good reviews before.",0
32051,"The hostel in itself has very few problems, the rooms are fine, the pool is nice and the social space is decent. However, check in and check out takes roughly three times as long as any other hostel, you can only use a pre paid card to make purchases and you will find yourself signing you name every 5 minutes. For me the biggest issue is the location, with nothing of interest really in walking distance you really require a scooter, which seem to be perpetually booked out, to experience much of Canggu. ",0
32103,"I wouldn't recommend this property in Austin, as the service and quality of the staff in a reflection of what you receive for the price you pay. As a business traveler, this is bad Business for Hiltom",0
32118,"I want to start off by saying I have been a Hilton Honors member for quite some time. I’ve stayed at many Hilton hotels across the country. I have had nothing but positive experiences with Hilton Brand hotels up until staying at this location. This by far was the worst experience I’ve had at a hotel by The Hilton brand in my experience. I was notified Management had changed recently.   I stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks for work.   1. Upon arrival, the hotel was understaffed so check-in took 45 minutes as the card machine was not working.   2. The second night of my stay the elevator was stuck on the second floor and no sign was posted, but each person was instructed by the desk supervisor to walk up the stairs to second floor and bring the elevator down themselves.  3. On another occasion the desk supervisor was absent from the desk for about 30 minutes while guests waited. She returned with a fast food bag and proceeds to make guests wait for an additional 5 minutes before helping guests.   4. After staying here for about a week and multiple interactions with the desk supervisor, one night I go to alert them that my phone was not working. She proceeds to shrugs her shoulders and tell me “what do you want me to do about it?” I proceeded to ask her to fix it because I’d like to be able to request housekeeping as this hotel requires a request to be made. I walk away from the desk after the exchange and the desk supervisor proceeds to leave her post, walk after me to tell me “not to have an attitude” and begins to yell at me in front of other guests. I not only felt uncomfortable but threatened.   I later walk down to ask for the manager’s contact information and the desk supervisor refuses. I find the contact information and request to speak with the General Manager. I speak with the GM the next day to describe the situation and the GM says they are short staffed so not much disciplinary action could be taken aside from additional training. She comps me for 1 day of my three week stay and offers me a free drink.   6. Days later my overhead bathroom lights go off permanently with exception of the shower light. I tell the desk supervisor with nothing being done.   7. Additionally, while raining the power in the entire hotel goes off for a total of five to ten minutes completely.   My experience here was by far the worst I’ve had. Staff as well as management lack customer service and professionalism and management perpetuates and accepts this behavior. I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU STAYING HERE.",0
32121,"The room smelled bad, could not place the smell, was similar to how a place smells after a house floods and has subsequently not dried well. Not so much an actual cleaning issue. Sagging mattress, toilet did not work. AC did not work right,  come on and then off almost right away . Almost moved out the second night. ",0
32124,"Not worth the money! Hilton rates with a motel 8 quality! Beds uncomfortable, pool area was very trashy. BBQ grills outside very nasty with food left in them. Trash in pool area overflowing. Low quality workout gym with outdated equipment!",0
32136,"Recently, I reserved and prepaid with my CC a 3 night stay for a employee being recruited. After pre-paying the hotel, H2S charged my guest as well! Very embarrassing!  When I called to complain, I was met with rudeness and delays.  Do not stay at this hotel. The Hotel GM has never called me to apologize or fix.",0
32143,This is an older hotel and for the most part clean. The smellin the room was horrendous!!!  Would never recommend this place to anyone. Went to a staff member and they said many complaints had been filed because of the scent of the rooms,0

32154,"The worst hotel experience we ever had . Stayed at Home2 before when it was fairly new so we decided to stay again.  After two long days of work and driving, we checked in and didn’t check under the beds    My wife and daughter arrived later    We enjoyed a great Mercyme concert and settled in to sleep .. I got up before everyone and went downstairs. Later I got my things together to head home with my wife and daughter to follow about an hour later.   As they are packing up they noticed a bug on a/c next to my wife’s bag.   Notified the desk and they went to look  said they could use another room to shower and they wanted to wash her clothes.  What’s the point I was already on my way home.  They were delayed over three hours and while they waited for nothing basically my wife checked and the bed was completely infested with bedbugs. Now my wife is covered with bedbug bites.  I spent 8 hrs after I got home doing everything I possibly could to prevent the bedbugs from getting into our house. My wife was told we would get a report from exterminator and I would get a call from the hotel to follow up.   Neither has happened yet.",0
32160,"I’ve stayed twice in last two months at this place only because our company prefers Hilton hotels. I’m noticing consistent issues.  Issue #1: Front desk is always empty. It’s a pattern I’ve noticed during both of my stays. You have to find and guess who is a front desk staff to get assistance. I had issues in checkout last time and I looked around over 10 mins before my coworker found the front desk staff to help.  Issue #2: The hotel is extremely clean in general. However, my boss had a sheet with blood in it so he ended up sleeping on the couch as it was too late at night when we came in. My room had cockroach as attached in the picture.  Issue #3: There is a hidden charge for late night check in. The room rate was $30/night higher when booked Mon-Friday compared to if I book 2 separate reservations 1 for Monday and 1 for Tue-Friday",0
32193,I reserved a two bedroom suite for my family of 7 as we are military en route to our new duty station. Upon arrival I had been downgraded to a one bedroom. I paid the same price for half the space! I also was told no discount for a second room or for the smaller room and to “be glad we’re allowing you to stay because it’s against codes for that many in one room” I will not be booking at one of these hotels again. Poor customer service! ,0
32528,Food and drinks are terrible  Our daughter’s room flooded and stuff was ruined. When they washed the wet closures they lost 2 shirts and basically told us oh well. Moved us to a room that was a down grade which they made seem as an upgrade. Only compensation was $120 which doesn’t even cover the cost to replace the items lost,0
32598,"This was the worst and the smallest room I have ever stayed in.  When I booked the room, I chose the deluxe twin room, which was supposed to be 118 square feet.  However, the room I got (#2) had only one bed and the room was approximately 7 ft. by 8 12 ft.  The bathroom (shower, sink, and toilet, with no shower curtain) took up part of that space.  It was just big enough for a bed and a small walkway to the side of and along the foot of the bed.  Although it was advertised as a non-smoking hotel, the room smelled like cigarette smoke.  I told Mike that the odor was terrible, and he sprayed the room.  Unfortunately then it smelled like a combination of smoke and a chemical spray.  The wallpaper was peeling in several places, and it was not applied properly.  So overall, the room was tiny, smelly, and depressing. It was not deluxe in any way.  Substandard would be a more accurate description.  It was half the size of the room advertised, which I think is deplorable. That is false advertising!  If I had known the true size of the room, I never would have stayed there, so I think that I should get at least half of my money back.  It was in a good location, near the TST subway and the A21 airport bus, but that was the only positive thing about it.  There was no lobby, just a small room from which you could access the 5 sleeping rooms,with a dispenser for hot and cold drinking water.  Not a place to hang out if your room made you feel claustrophobic.  So to call it a ""boutique"" hostel is quite an overstatement.",0
32675,"This place is no boutique hotel, period. Even calling it a hotel is a misnomer. It is basically a collection of five guest rooms occupying a section of a floor in an old commercial building. It is also clearly a fire hazard as there is no fire escape plan for guests. Neighbouring units include a Korean language centre and a massage centre.  I booked a so-called deluxe double room and got the shock of my life! Room 4 was so tiny that two persons will have to take turns to walk if they are not on the bed. And even one person will find it a struggle to take a shower in the cubicle of a bathroom without bumping into the sink and the toilet bowl! Naturally my wife and I checked out after only one night and were in fact quite happy to forfeit the other three nights that we had booked and paid for. It is unbelievable that this place is ranked so highly by TripAdvisor and we are of course thoroughly disappointed as our choice was based entirely on this ranking. ",0
32696,This is the last time I book in this hotel  This is how I received the room  With dirty towels with hair  And dirty floor  This is what i saw  I don’t know if there’s more dirties in the room   Note ( i paid for upgrade room )  Not for upgrade dirts ,0

Checked in and my sheets were not changed from the previous guest as there were long synthetic hairs over the bed when you pulled back the duvet which is disgusting especially during covid and I had my 10 month old infant with me. I called the front desk to ask about the Netflix, the agent said I had to turn on my Bluetooth, I couldn’t figure it out and called back 30 minutes later and got a different agent who said she would send someone up to show me. An hour and a half later I called back and got a different person again saying no one ever came to my room to show me and this agent then told me the Netflix in the rooms doesn’t work because they aren’t smart tvs. I explained I had spoke to two different people before her who told me two different things and how it was wrong to have me waiting for nothing. She never even apologized but said they probably didn’t know bout the Netflix. Waste of a night, there was nothing to watch on tv. The next morning I complained to one of the agents and he was able to send maintenance up and he showed me how to put on the Netflix which means I could have had it all along and last agent just said anything to me. The morning I was supposed to checkout I called and asked for tissue as I ran out of tissue. 3 hours later I check out and no one ever brung me any tissue. ",0
33030,"On November 16 I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Southwest Loop hotel in Chicago, we had a reservation for two nights, when I got up on November 17 I noticed some bites on my neck, I thought it was an ant or any other insect that had stung. That same night when we arrived at the hotel we went to bed to rest and when I got up a few hours later, I noticed bites on my hands, we checked the bed and got some small red animals, one dead and the other was alive, Everything got worse on November 18 In the morning, I have bites all over my body, we checked the mattress and saw that they have Bed Bugs in their room, immediately my husband went down to the lobby and the person who attended him gave him the key to another room and told him that he would speak with him manager to see what they could do, we did not receive the other room because we were about to leave, when we returned for our bags the person who was in the lobby said that they would only do an investigation and call us. The issue now is that I even had to go to an urgent care to inject something, I have huge bites all over my body. I have photos of all this, both of my bites and of the animals that had the bed. I WANT MY MONEY BACK for me this is unacceptable, you know that you have bed bugs in the beds because now I read the reviews of your hotel and it is not the first time that happens. I NEED A SOLUTION, for me this has no justification",0

33048,Poor customer service and non attentive staff. The room seating was old and uncomfortable consisting of one worn fabric high back chair and one fabric very low back rolling desk chair which could easily tip over. There were only two towels for a family of three and a quarter roll of toilet paper with no replacement roll upon arrival. The carpet was well worn and dirty looking. Even after running the air conditioning the room still smelled musty. I have stayed in this area many times over many years. It is worth considering other properties first. ,0

Then for the towels you need to go to the reception to pay for a card again only by cash. Then you need to go to inside pool to ask for towels but there is nobody there.

We asked for it, and was told it would be delivered at some point after being sanitised but never received it. Had to go downstairs and pick it up the next morning but we were already checking out because reception doesn't open until check out time (10am) which isn't helpful because if you need anything before checking out, there's no one to help you. Can't really rate a hotel where you can't clean yourself or have a coffee or anything. These are basic amenities you'd expect anywhere. The room itself was noisy as well. It faces a road with quite a bit of traffic and the noise insulation isn't good so it's pretty loud. ",0

Book a twin room but gave us a double bed. After fight, they upgrade us into suite which has a double bed and a sofa bed. Breakfast for two has already included in the room rate. When we ordered the breakfast in room, no one alerted us we needed to pay. That means when we check out, they charged us two breakfasts which is very absurd. Definitely will not go back! ",0
34257,"Arrived in Farimont, Nanjing hotel in November and found the room extremely cold. I asked for heat in the room and I was told there is not heat. I asked for portable heater and I was told there is only 1 in the hotel and the sfaff need it. Had I not threatened the staff with a bad review, I definitely would have gotten very sick from the coldness. The bathrooms have a disgusting sewer stench wafting through the rooms. This is a common problem in China. I can only guess they do not want to install J-traps to help prevent the sewer stench reaching hack through the pipes. I tried to use the gym and I was told by the staff member, that the gym was not open, despite the reception stating it was. The gym employee followed me back to my room and forcibly grabbed the towel from my neck after my gym workout. The small towel looked like the cheapest mechanics rag and I used it just to prevent further cold waiting in the freezing hallways for the elevators. I asked the reception staff for a small piece of scotch tape to seal an envelope and they claimed they don't have any tape. One day, after walking in Nanjing all day, I sat in a completely empty lobby lounge area chair and within 10 seconds I was told I need to order a drink otherwise I can not sit there. There were several western management personnel present throughout the hotel, but they were just as inhospitable. Instead of addressing the issues, they claimed ""They have not heard of these issues before, period"". I was one of the few paying customers in the hotel at the time I stayed. I saw only handful of other guests throughout my few days stay. The hotel was so empty, the staff cancelled the dinner in the hotel after my 2nd night, because there just wasn't enough guests to justify keeping the kitchen open. There were no other restaurants/supermarkets within close walking distance of the hotel and I felt like I was restricted to staying in my sewer stench room, unless I wanted to freeze and pay $20 for a drink to sit in the lobby lounge, under the clock and under surveillance. Of course there was plenty of construction noise happening at any hour of the day or night. Fortunately, I was so exhausted, it didn't disturb my sleep. Overall, this was not a good experience. It was a shame, because the hotel was very newly constructed and had great potential to be a good hotel. I paid about $150 USD for the cheapest room, but I wouldn't go back there for half the price and only with confirmation of heat to the temperature I like in the room.",0

No staff came to ask how the food was during the meal and afterwards so feedback wasn’t given.   The gentleman on the reception desk at checkout was abrupt and appeared to have forgotten how to smile.   A very poor showing and I won’t be returning.

Even simple items such as fresh fruit were allowed to run out and not replenished when I was there.  I did get a good omelette though which partially made up for it.  Oh, and and the shuttle from the HK ferry terminal seems to have gone too!  I waited for it on arrival but in the end opted for taxi.",0
34625,Travelled with my boss who always has a suite or club room. Check in was one of the worse as most staff don't even speak or understand English. Having travelled for the last 30 years plus on business or leisure on my own. I was never given two single beds travelling alone. I returned to the reception n asked for one double bed to be told that there will be additional charge ... Us$30 more. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. I gave up despite having the hotel manager called me to discuss this matter. No more holiday inn @ zhuhai for me.,0
34954,We had a worst experience ever to our event. Where you can find an Event Sales Manager will not talked to you personally and meet up to talked about our event. Event Sales Manager should be accommodating because it represent the hotel to have an event. As far as I know that Al Najada is a 5 star hotel but based on our experience we don't feel that we was treated that way. ,0
34994,"Booked for 3 nights but only got informed while check-in that there would be NO electricity, aircon and WIFI in the afternoon during my stay.

35216,The worst service I have ever received- they treated my group (75+ and I with absolutely 0 respect and the state of the hotel is clearly going downhill.

35228,"I chose this hotel because it was in an old, now re-purposed, Abbey.  The website pictures totally represent the hotel.  The rooms were certainly large by Paris standards but they were bare - not even a bar fridge (I have medication that requires refrigeration) or tea/coffee making facilities and there was a sign in the room stating that no food or drink could be consumed in the room unless it was room service (and that was inadequate).  The safe was broken and the room was so dusty and dirty that I didn't walk on the floor without socks.  No air-conditioning either so I roasted most nights.  I wouldn't stay here again if it was free.",0

35641,"We just cameback from our stayed in Barcelona at eric vokel ,unfurtunately with a bad taste of our 4 nights there.  The next mornig after our arrival I went to the front desk to request assistance regarding 2 issues,simple ones,the dryer is not working and one of the bathroom sink were clogged.  I went the next morning again,they never took seriously my request for service we left last saturday with the issue still pending in room 32 and with 15 pounds of laundry.  One of the reason we took this hotel,apartment was the convinience of washer and dryer.  The excuse was the maintenance guy never came,I talk to him directly the first morning for few minutes,he was with his uniform ststing hes the maintenance guy.  They loe to me and they dont care.Ifelt like 55 years old stupid tourist trying to solve an issue  for my family to have a confortable end of our 2 weeks vacation in Europe.  Thank you for nothing,member services team at Barcelona sagrada familia.",0
35649,"We booked for Barcelona with our 4 children for a week back in February 2020 for travel during the Easter holidays (April). Due to the pandemic and travel restriction we contacted the hotel for a refund, but they refused saying we could rebook for a later date up until 2021! Our airlines (a small Spanish one refunded us!) Due to further travel restrictions in the UK and the fact one of our children has a condition which can be critical if he gets COVId, (which I explained) I asked for a refund again last week stating we would not be comfortable travelling this year and without a vaccination possibly we would not even be allowed!  No, no refund we will offer you a chance to rebook up until 2022? Seriously how long can we keep this for? Also if the price changes we have to pay the extra cost!! I am being asked to forcefully travel or forfeit over £2000! That is not going to make people want to ever book with you again Eric Vökel, if this is your idea of customer service, you have a lot to learn.  While I understand everyone is going through a difficult time holding people’s money isn’t fair on families who may also be having a difficult time financially.

The breakfast I pre-paid for was not buffet style.",0
35781,"After a long day of travel and an impending business dinner meeting, I got to my room to find no closet, no hangers, no iron.  I went back to the front desk to request another room but was told ""sorry hotel is full"" then I got some snark about how the Aloft brand was artsy and their rooms reflected this.  First, I guess my elite status at Marriott is worth zero, second, I have stayed at a number of Alofts before and always had hangers! I was also told that while they don't have a closet, there is a rail on which to hang close (after you get some coveted hangers), and yep, there it is, conveniently located over the coffee machine and the ice bucket (both of which you will need to move if you are hanging anything larger than toddlers clothing)  On top of that, my safe was pre-locked shut and the thermostat did not work.  Engineering did resolve both of those issues quickly - Maintenance team was definitely 5 star - best part of the stay  If you do want to use your ice bucket - Ice machines are only located on floors 3 and 19.  And make sure you have your room key - ice machines are in secure rooms -  they definitely don't want anyone stealing ice  I will never stay at this hotel again and will rethink ever staying at an Aloft hotel if this is the new standard.  Oh, and the self park we used across the street was extremely inconvenient.  There are way to many better hotel options in Chicago.  Skip this place.",0
35784,"If I could use one word to describe this hotel it would be “Annoying”. For the price I expected a very hip hotel but what I got was a room full of cheap shortcuts and low quality. First off the room I booked was a king with city view. The room was tiny with no closet. The only place to hang your clothes is on a bar that is over your room counter above your coffee brewer (coffee was disgusting). And they only give you 3 hangers and few wall hooks around the room. The area rug by the couch was FILTHY! Brown stains all over it. I tried not to let my mind wonder what they were exactly. My partner and I folded it back so we didn’t have to walk on it. Next we had the bathroom which was okish at best. My main complaint there was no shelf in the shower, like zero. You had to either take your personal products out with you every time or leave them on the shower floor….yeah gross. The bed was comfortable to sleep on however there was no duvet cover on the comforter just two regular flat sheet sandwiching it and they were very rough. Lastly the phone in the room did not work. I will say the staff was friendly, I avoided the lounge/cafe area as it just looked sad and cheap. If your are looking for a collage dorm room type of stay this is your place. Just expect to pay an arm and a leg for it. I will never stay here or with Aloft again.",0
35785,It’s where garbage is taken out and supplies are loaded for some kind of food business. Ridiculously loud and noise has been going on for close to an hour now. Front desk admitted this happens every morning. Ask to move if you get a room overlooking the alley.,0
35804,We arrived at the hotel where the valet hurried us out of our vehicle causing us to leave half of our things in the car. After we had everything loaded on the luggage carts we proceeded to check in and get our room keys. After SIX keys and three trips to the front desk we finally got in our room to put our stuff down. Not the cleanest room I have ever stayed in and for the price they are charging that is not acceptable. The pool is tiny and not the best for a stay with children. The pool hours posted on the site I booked through stated it closed at 2300(11pm). My daughter was in a whole 15 minutes before the attendant came in to shut it down at 2200(10pm). We will definitely not be back and this may have ruined it for any future ALOFT bookings. We travel quite a bit and have never had an experience like this.,0
35805,"Lets begin at arrival, we had reservations for 2 rooms, we were coming from out of town for a bachelorette party. We had requested early check in as we had a full afternoon and were were traveling in, we need to freshen up and have a place to put our bags.    We pull into valet and we have a car full of bags, suitcases and , a cooler, we proceed to try to get early check in as requested, as we approached the desk you could immediacy tell we were not going to be the highlight of the check in desks afternoon, we were told that early check in was a request and just that a ""request"" we asked if we could potentially get one room to at least change and put all of our stuff in it, and we were refused, we were told to call back.    During this time both valet people, stood by and watched the girls get all of the bags out and struggle with 2 luggage carts, neither one ever offered any type of help not even as simply to hold a door, I was in utter shock.   Some of the girls had to change their clothes in the hotel lobby restroom.    We called back in an hour to see if the room was available and it was not and yet again asked if we could possibly get one room, we were told, if I give you a room I am separating your rooms and I will put you on different floors. (the under tone was threatening.)    In the meantime I had tried to call and make reservations at a different hotel however it was the weekend of the air show and a big concert, so no luck changing hotels.  We ended up being able to check in about 20 minutes early.   On to day number two... we wake up to have the girls come get us and there is what appears to be a dead mouse, grey fur and all, at this point we just cant we go to breakfast I call Corporate Marriot because number one I do not want to deal with the front desk from the previous day I had never been treated so poorly,   Marriott tells me to go to the front desk and let them know and that I had a case number for a complaint and they would be in touch next week.....   The head housekeeper came up and was so nice and apologetic she took pictures and removed it.    The next day we checked out.    I have called Marriot this past week and they said Aloft had compensated us, and had sent an email, I  called Aloft and left a message on 10/5 and called again on 10/6 I was told one night was not charged, and I said that is not acceptable the entire stay was horrific (Of course I get the same Peach from check in), and no one reached out. DIRTY AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE",0
35810,"My mom and I stayed here while visiting family. It will be our  last ever stay at an Aloft. Not only was our family vacation ruined due to problems at the hotel, I never felt so undervalued as a guest. We also were cheated as we paid for services that we never received.   We checked into our room on Thursday night. Got in the shower and no soap or shampoo. Woke up in the morning and someone else's hair in the bed. Quite disconcerting during a pandemic. Only one coffee cup. Makes you think the room wasn't serviced. No phone in the room to call down to the desk to request what was missing and needed fixing. Spoke with managers each day with promises to fix things. It went downhill from there. All promises not fulfilled.   Friday manager said room would be fully serviced within an hour and one night would be compensated, returned 8 hours later to find out nothing had been touched. Ended up asking for bed linens and having to service our own room - make beds, empty trash, etc.  We finally received soap on day 3. Once we did receive soap, we didn’t have any washcloths. Basically 3 nights in a row - our entire stay and either no washcloth and/or no soap to shower.   Lost Friday night entertainment in Chicago due to having to service room and wait on supplies (7:30pm-9:30pm). Had a lengthy conversation and wait while she tried to contact manager from the day before. That conversation resulted in, ""we will compensate you for on night. We will offer you a king room (we needed 2 beds) or you can move to the Sheraton (did not have time to pack up and move)"". Asked if materials were available for us to service our own room since she nor any other staff on property could service it. I then asked for full sets of towels, bed linens, a garbage bag to put our trash in. Was told it would be there in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later, we received part of the bed linens, no wash clothes, and no trash bag. Said they would return. Another long wait. Then we services our room, made our beds, emptied our trash etc. Was given a bag of bottles - shampoo and conditioner - and didn’t realize until the next day that the requested soap was still not there. By the time we were situated as best we could be, it was too late to do our planned sightseeing/entertainment that night.   Finally received a phone in the room on our last night. However, it didn’t work.   Ruined our vacation. Promised one night compensation by 3 different managers - which wasn't nearly enough for the circumstances and problems that continued night after night. The promised one night compensation also never happened and I was charged fully for 3 nights.   Each manager was less than empathetic. Basically just nodded and said “OK"" after each issue was raised. It was never “OK”. Then made a promise to service the room or to send up missing items or to compensate the room - most all of which never happened. Worst hotel experience ever.",0
35812,"The biggest dive I ever stayed. In.   I'm 62 years old and I have stayed in some dives over the years.  The refrigerator was 45 degrees, no microwave. Tiny fridge and tiny room.  I stayed in some dives 40 years ago or so, and this one beets them all!!!",0
35818,We Arrived to the room and there was 2 water bottles on the desk. 1 was opened and half empty. Next day we left the room at 9 am and we came back at 3 pm to the room.  and front desk said the cleaning room is upon request. They never told us that we have to request the elemental service. At 8 pm we went down to the lobby to hang out there and the area was closed. The person on duty at the reception did not allowed to use the pool table 'cause the area was closed,0
35821,"We have been staying at this Aloft several times a year, but we will try another hotel next time.  This started off as a fun place but now the vibe has changed.  When we walked into our  room the window was wide open.  We closed it and left to meet friends.  When we came back, the room reeked of cigarette smoke.  So that explains why the window was left open.  But they clearly didn't do much to clean the room and mitigate the smoke.room.  We had a hard time checking in because rooms weren't ready so we didn't try to change rooms.  We had to open the window and sleep that way.  The sound of the city was nice except the ambulances to/from the nearby hospital and the overnight loading/unloading of trucks on the street below.  The lack of effort to clean up the smoke smell left us concerned about how well Aloft tries to mitigate the COVID risk in the rooms.  The first day we left out the 'do not disturb' on the door but the next day we took it off so that the room would be cleaned, and maybe address some of the smoke smell.  But the room wasn't cleaned.  When we asked about it that afternoon they said they don't clean rooms unless requested, and housekeeping had ended for the day.  We searched and could find no notification that they weren't cleaning rooms, and it wasn't mentioned at check-in.  We ended up running out of facial tissue and almost ran out of toilet paper.  So they clearly didn't prepare our room for our length of stay without housekeeping.  This careless attitude was the first sign that the vibe has changed.  Another was all the shouting and door slamming on our floor in the middle of the night.  I called the front desk twice but it didn't seem to make a difference.  Earlier, there was a very loud drunk in the lounge disturbing everyone.  The hotel staff stood at a distance watching but didn't seem to be very concerned.  Again, not the vibe that this Aloft has had in the past.  A couple of other beefs.  We usually get a larger corner room for the rate, but we gor a small room with only one window.  And they gave us the wrong portion of the valet ticket so there was no number to call for our car.",0
35825,"No valet. 100% booked durning a pandemic. Amenities that are not really...available. Never again. Keep scrolling, any hotel is better than this one. Marijuana smoke all throughout the hotel.

There was a door that you would think was a closet, but it was narrow indent in the wall for the ironing board. The “closet” was a rod big enough for 4 hangers, that’s it! Out of two drawers one was taken by the safe. The nightstands did not have any drawers or shelves. Awful layout!",0
36071,"I wanted to like this place more - its very convenient especially for Darling Harbour. However we didn't get off to a good start. Arrived at 450pm - to be greeted by a queue out the door. I tried to check in online before this - if your not already Hilton Honours registered this isn't possible until your app has been confirmed.  When we finally got to the desk after 530 we were told the room wasn't ready. When I queried why a room supposedly ready for 3pm was not ready at 530 the hapless reception staff called the cleaners - and apparently it was ready after all. When we arrived on our floor there were no cleaners to be seen, in any room, so I think they just couldn't be bothered to check. On the plus side the room was ok - and had a glimpse view of the harbour. The bed was ok, everything is relatively new so worked ok. It was also quiet. We booked a vivid package, supposedly including a cocktail each, and parking. At check in the reception staff did not have a clue what I was talking about. At check out , the 'included' parking apparently wasnt possible because we arrived at 10 to 5. I was told to pay direct to Wilson as 'this would be better' . Better how ? it cost $64 and the promised deduction on my final bill never materialised. Surprise surprise, the included 2 cockails as part of the vivid package were also charged at $20 each. This hotel looks nice from the outside - but needs a shake up on the front desk if I was ever to consider staying again.",0
36076,"Recently stayed and the hotel and location were fine for our needs, however I have paid for the room and also had an ADDITIONAL 110% charge of the room placed against my account. They didn't care and said it was the bank holding the funds and it will be released in 5 -10 days. Should never have  been 2 charges to my account. Never had the problem in any other hotel stay around the world. Own the problem and fix it. Gave them every chance to resolve before doing a review. Terrible business practice and very poor customer experience.",0
36111,"Stayed for 1 night for business for the first time. Despite good establishments, several services were disappointed. Restaurant- uncooked mussels were served restaurant took off the charge from the bill Room-it was a day when Fire Drills happened. I understand the importance and waited fire alarm to stop for a while but it continued more than 15 minutes. Rang reception and they said it will continue another 10 to 15 minutes. Next engineer came and told he needs to test my room. I was waiting for my business call and I told him to come back later. This is not the standard of service and I was so disappointed ",0
36157,"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed. Since you enter the reception they cannot be bothered to recommend you any restaurant or even to show you on the map. This suppose to be 4*, but should be 2*. An awful bathroom, dirty floor, horrible service. Just worst hotel I ever visited. Do not waste your money. ",0
36162,"We went to this hotel end of July for 3 nights booked through Eurostar as a 4 star hotel.  Eurostar need to actually check the hotel plunge pool not a available until last day.   The room was very small which you would expect in Paris for 2 or 3 star. But the worst bit was the gap between the shower and wall to get to the toilet was 7inches, had to turn sideways , absolutely ridiculous. Breakfast was not good.   We changed rooms from standard to superior which we found was worst than the standard. We have been to many hotels around the world but this place was rubbish. Feel for the staff who work here. How they get good reviews beats me.",0
36163,"Rated as 4 stars but is worst than what I expected. No water provided, mini bar was empty.   During this hot summer, air conditioning wasn’t working properly, sweat the whole night.  The room next to the lift was not a good room. You can hear the noise of the lift and people talking load.  The only advantage is there is a sauna and mini pool at -0 floor.  I would not recommend this hotel if you want a good night sleep.  ",0
36190,"I had to pay the breakfast charge that was about 40Euro before checking out. However, the lady from the reception desk wanted to charge me 300Euro and she gave me an attitude that she thought I didn't speak English before I was even going to ask her any question.  I was confused and told her that I had paid everything through Hotel.com and I asked her what 300Euro was coming from.  She told me it was ""government tax"" and did not bother explaining anything further.  She went on and had my credit card wiped and made me sign the bill.  This is my first time to France and I had a flight to catch so I did not want to start a fight with her that might ruin my day and I did really act like a gentleman.  Fortunately, at the end, she somehow realized she made a mistake by herself and returned my money.  However, this is a very unpleasant experience.",0

36310,"We had a very disappointing stay at the Mercure Hotel. We selected this hotel as we were arriving on the Indian Pacific train from Perth and it was the nearest to Central Station, the idea being we would have a few days in Sydney, before returning home to the Northern Rivers.  The design of this hotel is strange, the front door, where the cars, taxis and limos go, is actually another block away, down a narrow, dismal back lane called Little Regent Street. The back door, in Railway Square, is not signed and is unwelcoming. Going through the door, we were faced with stairs down to Reception. The lift to that floor was out of order. There was no Concierge service and no one offered to help us with our luggage. When we did get to Reception we were dealt with quickly, however, on getting to our room there was a letter saying that due to Covid safety? our room would be only serviced after a 3 day stay, this meant for nearly $250 a night, we had to service our own room. If I was staying in self-catering, this would be fine, but we believed we were staying in a 4 star city hotel. Next discovery was that the restaurant was closed and there was only one eatery open, a bar, called Eve's Bar. We then booked a table at midday for our evening meal but on arrival at 6pm we found our reservation had ""disappeared"". The staff did eventually find us another table, but if the hotel is worried about cleaning our room because of Covid, this worry didn't carry to the pub, which was busy (and noisy) and we were very close to the next table.  On day 2 we ran out of tea and coffee and went down to Reception to ask for some, this never arrived! We had regular visits to Reception as throughout our stay, from day one, our keycard would not operate the lift and we had to get new cards every day.  Day 3 we went to Reception where a member of staff tried to assisst, as we had now run out of shampoo, soap, etc. Another reason we had booked this hotel was that it advertised a shuttle service to the airport, you won't be surprised to hear this wasn't available, either, the company they used was no longer available. The receptionist did arrange for a taxi for us, which probably worked out as cheap as a shuttle. He did arrange for more tea and coffee to be delivered to the room (it never came) and offered a full room service, which we declined as we were leaving the next day, we did ask for clean towels, which were delivered but the old, three day wet towels were not taken away.  Consequently, we were glad to leave this hotel. We are Accor Members but I cannot think of anything to recommend it. It certainly cannot possibly deserve four stars.",0
36676,"I booked this hotel on booking.com for 12 nights. Istanbul is great to travel to during winter because it is Very cheap. I got a great deal. About $660.   About 7 hours into the booking I ask for cancellation. Apparently it's their policy not to have bookings cancelled.I called the property and asked, I barely got anyone speaking English. They still refused to cancel. I said, OK - will try it out and see. What's the worst that could happen. They debuted MY card almost as soon as I made the booking.   The hotels ratings are very good for location. The reviews are not so quite. So I get there and check in. I ask for a tour after being taken to my room.   Deck, and then I ask for the gym. It's in the basement I am told. We go there.  And it's like a scrap place. Dark. No lights but it's also suffocating. Not aerated at all. There was only a treadmill which looked run down. Doubt it would have worked.   My room, dark, cold, no tea or coffee.  Hotel only makes breakfast. No food - had been on a 9hour flight. I couldn't get myself to even use the bathroom. My room had a lot of noise from outside, so I decide to close the windows. Mold and rust met me, and I was petrified.   I immediately checked out. And found another hotel.   This is not  a hotel, but an Inn or GuestHouse. The gym is very dilapidated.  Have staff that barely speak English.   Only thing they have going for them is location but even then, nah.

36990,"I wrote a review previous to this, was HARASSED via phone and email by the manager to remove it, then they had it taken down about a week ago.  Interesting when my review only showed the condition of the property and spoke about my experience there.   I’ll quickly reiterate it again because I think it’s important for people to have realistic expectations.  They do not have a real restaurant, it is a small room with a bar at the end.  The food we had was inedible and looked like it was just heated from frozen.  The pool is very quiet and the “service” is if you can track someone down.  The room was clean, but that’s where the good ends.  The decor is incredibly outdated and mismatched.  The outdoor tub we had looked like it had not been cleaned in awhile and had a green tint to it.  There is little to no privacy on the patios, and there are people and cars constantly going by on the trail outside.   As for location, the view is pretty, but so are most views in Santorini.  You are pretty far from other restaurants, shopping and walking around any town, so just know what you are getting.   I will again include pictures and continue to post this review no matter how many harassing calls and emails I get from the property.",0

37590,"Check in and out was okay.  Room cleanliness is okay too.  Pool experience was good, pool water was not cold, a little warm, which is great. But swimming at night may be too dim and dark.  Located just a stone throw from Outram Park MRT Station. There's no shopping mall or convenience shop nearby, so during my stay i would just take 1 station down to Chinatown to shop and buy food.   However, we had a really bad experience during our 3D2N stay. On the 2nd day, we allowed the Housekeeping attendant to make up the room while we were out. We returned in the afternoon. In the evening when we were about to go for a swim, I realised that my daughter's swimming vest went missing. I searched high and low for it, but couldn't find it. I called Housekeeping, but was transferred to Reception, I told them my item is missing, they said they will check with Housekeeping. Awhile later, the Housekeeping attendant came to our room to return the plastic bag containing the swimming vest. I was really upset by this incident as Housekeepers should never take or throw away guest's item without checking and just assuming it's rubbish. I went down to complain to the Front Office Manager, all she said was ""Sorry that she (the housekeeper) accidentally threw it away"". I know it's not the FM Manager's fault, I'm not blaming her, but I want to highlight that there should not even be any ""accidentally threw away guest's personal item"" incident. Housekeeping attendants are to be trained with the BASIC skill of always double checking thoroughly and properly on the items they are going to remove from the room and throw away! How can they accidentally throw away guest's personal item?! This bag of item was not even near the bin to be mistook as rubbish! I even have photos of the item which totally can't be mistook as rubbish, and the plastic bag is not even tied up. Frankly speaking, I can even call this an action of theft! And only when I found out it was missing then the housekeeper returned it! And what's worse? This hotel failed miserably on customer service. Zero service recovery was implemented for such a huge and serious mistake that could be reported as theft. I've worked in Housekeeping and Front Office before. Currently I'm still working in a customer service industry. The way they handled this issue, was simply terrible and speechless.",0
37595,"Check in yesterday for quarantine order. First time ask for simple request but can't fulfill. The staffs mentioned one pillow will only be given for single occupant.

37605,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights, booked this hotel because it has a great 5 ⭐️ review.. upon arrival on 2nd Jan, hot/warm water wasn’t available(decided to gv it a slide). Woke up next day(OUR WEDDING DAY) still no hot water to shower... gave them a call to check whats up? Staff said the lower floors were affected due to the weather 🙄🙄 and technicians are trying to rectify the problem... okay.. went out and came back to the hotel at 10.30pm!!!! STILL NO HOT WATER TO BATHE!?!? Requested to move us to a higher floor where the “high floors” weren’t affected much..my husband and I were put through multiple calls with the staff back and forth until 1:30am just to move us to a higher floor but they refused to... all they could offer is just a later checkout time for more rest... and all this happened on our wedding day and even the day before!!! Imagine the exhaustion we were put through coming back to the hotel and we just want to bathe and sleep during covid period! We paid the hotel with our own money without SRV too... this treatment we got... NEVER AGAIN WILL RETURN HERE! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎  * also.. who the hell are you in rights of budging in to check if our water isn’t hot? Your staff purposely came to check if our hot water wasn’t working and what an invade of privacy and think that we are lying! Your staff who changed our kettle also came in without permission to remove our kettle! 😡",0

37829,"We used this as a day hotel for transit purposes. Plus points - it's only a 10-min walk to nearest metro station; room is spacious; and staff are helpful. Our room was spacious, so for a day's use it suited our purpose - however the rooms dingy; safe was locked closed when we arrived, shower water was cold (immersion heater didn't work), tv and some lights tripped, and air conditioning control was difficult to operate (again we had to call maintenance). Fitted units were cheap and old, and I wouldn't have dared cook anything in the kitchen. Sheets looked OK, clean white cotton, but I was glad we didn't have to use the bed. Breakfast was a mix of all types of food, adequate. So, as there don't seem to be many hotels in Dubai offering day use, it sufficed - but for overnight stay, look elsewhere! Incidentally I think some reviewers may have written about a similar hotel with a pool - this doesn't have one.",0

When we complained they offered us a bar heater.   My husband was recovering from a virus, but ended up going by Ambulance to hospital with Pnemonia.  Apart from the Security Officer on Duty, the staff were totally uncooperative and were not prepared to help us in any way.   We were booked in and paid for 2 nights, but only spent a few hours there.  The Manager would not give us a refund.",0
37850,"The outside temperature was 30 degrees. Inside the A/C was about 10. The individual room controller would not adjust temperature. The smell of damp as you walked in the room was strong.  We changed rooms, same problem. Beds felt cold and damp. Bathrooms disgusting, mould, concrete patches around toilet, badly stained bath, missing tiles under vanity.  Only person who spoke reasonable English was security/doorman who phoned ambulance to take guest with pneumonia to hospital. When we complained about damp we were given heaters to put in the rooms. Staff member opened windows in one room and the condensation was incredible The fourth floor had machines drying out carpets in the hallway. Thanks to this hotel our friends spent 4 days in Dubai Hospital with pneumonia, had to reschedule flights home etc.  At no time were we offered any consideration or compensation by staff. When asked for the manger, were told he had gone home.",0

She was belittling and rude. She was not helpful looking up my reservation and then proceeded to be very rude when the reservation was found. I don't know how a hotel could let her work there. Also when calling downstairs for extra linens, she kept hanging up the phone call/ putting me on hold for almost 20 minutes. If you can stay somewhere else do it or check in before the evening shift comes on. I am disappointed that this is a Hilton Hotel, I might have to consider staying at a different hotel chain due to this employee.",0

While the breakfast was free (due to remodel), I heard from my colleague that the wait staff was reminding guests to tip.",0
37968,"The staff was friendly and talkative upon arrival and the lobby looks very nice. However, when we enter the room it was clear that the cleanliness was not up to par. The surfaces were not wiped down, the air conditioning had something melted (ice cream, maybe?) on the top of it and the bathroom was very dirty. There were drips of something on the bathroom wall (hair products possibly...), the bath tub had literal dirt on the bottom and side. Upon use of the shower the tub bottom felt slippery with soap scum. Also, there were broken tiles and the fourth level ice machine did not work. We were in a hurry to go to a concert and we were leaving early the next day to another event so we lived with the conditions. So to be fair I don’t know how the staff would have responded. I would say that our stay was not worth the $130 price tag (which btw did not include breakfast).",0

We originally booked through booking.com but he emailed back and said if you do it direct I will charge less, needless to say we won't be doing that again. Turns out we managed to sort out other hotels that fitted our holiday better and staff at the Naturale Villas. It's very similar to the Cubang Huts. Can't rate that hotel high enough.",0

Its literally next to your window see photo and video. There are several mosquitos in the room. The location is terrible its at the dead end street with grab taxi hardly finding it. Hit shower not working. Breakfast I don't know what's good about it.. You can buy the sausages and bread they use at 7 11 so if breakfast is one of the the reason for booking it.. Seriously stay elsewhere. It is not worth the 1k savings for 3days stay.. So many places not far from civilization. This booking was a huge mistake. Hated every minute of my stay here.,0

The room is out dated needs major renovations. Breakfast was cookies & croissants, instant coffee in which we had to wash our own cups. No safety deposit box in room. There is a lift as for elevators in which only 2 people can use at a time. Dorina the host complains a lot about other guests staying at the property & smokes her cigarettes all day & does not render her services as I expect it.

My transportation means to Barcelona is no longer there. I expect that the hotel would provide me with at least a partial refund or a credit for future booking.

39074,"We booked this apartment and paid almost £200 a night for a two bedroom apartment thinking it,s nearby Orchard Road, yes it is as stated on the website, however Km shown on the website are to the end of orchard road.  Rooms were not as big as we expected and breakfast? It's probably the worst breakfast I ever had in a hotel or apartment. It includes some water melon, pine apple, oranges, orange juice ( not fresh ) cereals , only one type of bread, butter, tea and coffee. Do NOT ASK FOR FRIED EGG OR OMELATE because they do not provide that.  We were 4 in total ( Two disabled on wheel chair ) we took one wheel chair with us thinking hotel might have a wheel chair. Hotel did have only one wheel chair and told us, when ever we need, we will get it back from our room, so kindly don't take it outside. In the end we hired one from the local shop.  Coming back to the breakfast, because we had two disable ladies and one career, I was the only one who could have breakfast in the restaurant so I requested if I could have disabled and career breakfast in the room. Answer was, No  I asked if I could take breakfast in the room myself, Elsie said, yes so I asked for a tray, answer was, No We don't have any tray although I could see all trays in kitchen myself.  There were very small serving plates so I just took some fruit ( Mainly water Mellon ) in two plates and asked my carer to take some savouries in two plates, no bread, cereals, tea or cofee.  Following day when when I came downstairs to have breakfast, I was stoped by Elsie and she told me, I took too much yesterday therefore am not allowed to take that much.  That was really embarrassing for me some one accusing me over food. It wasn't too much, water Mellon takes lot of space on a very small plate and I could fit only 5 pcs of water Mellon in a plate, that was disgusting of her saying some thing like that and I felt really embarrassed. What the hell was she thinking, we were greedy over food?   If we could afford nearly £800 to book a apartment, we could afford having decent breakfast some where else rather than a labeled breakfast le grove provide.  We were there for 4 days, we didn't bother having breakfast for remaining two days. If that is sort of service Le Grove provide, I would rather stay away next time.",0
39108,We book the room which was described as a duplex.  Whence arrived we found it to be a loft. Very steep steps to the loft with a double bed.   This situation was unsafe for us.

The person on the phone, very dissmissive and not at all interested said the carpark is full. We would need to park in a public carpark at Kings Cross.

But honestly, I should have cancelled and book something near Seoul Station instead of myeongdong.   Service is zero. Only one lady staff can speak average English and is thus helpful. The rest have quite mysterious purpose and presence here. I don't know why they are standing around and getting paid.  Tourist who wants to learn about history of Korea should stay here as the thinking they have in this hotel is prehistoric. Only men can use their hotel gym and sauna. Ladies who book here should demand a discount for being denied our rights to use hotel facilities.  Upon checking in, my Friend asked if this is a sleazy hotel. Bathroom glass wall and door are transparent. I was so ashamed of a bad booking. Worse - bathroom door is faulty and it takes them 3 days to repair. They didn't offer us ladies a change of room (prob since we're not men).  Sound system is bad. We heard our Neighbours moving around their room all night. There's noise from streets too.  I will never return to such a chauvinistic and stupid hotel. For Korea to have such a discriminating hotel it's quite a shame. ",0
40055,"The staff of this hotel has treated us so appallingly, I was genuinely shocked. We arrived after our passports got stolen when we were robbed in Bolzano. After spending a day of our vacation at the police station, we had to then rearrange the last day of our vacation to go to the embassy in Rome and get back to this hotel in Milan, for a night's sleep before our flight in the morning. When we got to the hotel by 11 pm, we encountered two staff members at the counter who refused to check us in, even with a certificate signed by the embassy. We tried to explain that we have been traveling since 3 am to get this certificate, that we already prepaid for the room and that we have got to sleep. But instead of treating us like paying customers, if not like human beings, they treated us like unwanted criminals, saying that they cannot check us in the room with the temporary certificate.  They seemed to change their minds after we asked to speak to the manager. Reluctantly, they gave us a key i after saying that they will take us to the room and help with the luggage, they let us find the room ourselves and carry the luggage two flights of stairs.  When we got to the tiny and cold room, we wanted to shower. It was a sad shower, in a crammed bathroom with rough towels that needed replacing at least two years ago. To add insult to injury, the drainage didn't work properly, the mattress was bumpy and our very much needed night sleep turned into a nightmare. Never in my life have I encountered such a disgusting attitude towards guests in a hotel anywhere. Especially not a hotel that should appreciate the miracle of having guests at all. Save the money, and stay literally anywhere in Milan, but here.",0
40115,"This hotel is frankly the most disgusting place we have ever stayed in. We arrived at the hotel after our flight and checked in.   It started off badly when they charged us a higher resort fee than our agent had advised us. The difference was negligible so we paid it and went up to our room.   The first thing that struck us in the corridors was the smell of damp, which was overwhelming. We were later told the hotel had flooded recently. The corridors were dirty and carpets were filthy.    We walked into the room and were greeted by stained curtains and an unpleasant smell. Upon further inspection of the room we found the bed frame to be dirty, the bathroom to be dirty and the whole room looked scruffy.  We advised front desk, who gave us another room which had very similar issues, this time with a chipped toilet pan thrown in. We again told front desk, who walked us around 6 other rooms, none of which were up to standard.   We said we were going to leave and find another hotel, and were told that there was no way to refund the resort fee (which doesn’t seem to have hit our credit card so presumably they resolved that issue.   If your agent has booked you into this hotel, we would strongly suggest you speak to them as a matter of urgency and change it.   You can generally judge a hotel by it’s lobby restroom.

We had 3 kids and we travelled all the way long for over 9 hours in night and faced issue after paying approx 3500SD for our stay.   4. after paying SD100 we were not given our choice of rooms with even when they were having list of passengers in which it shows kids, they gave us two Twin bed room instead of Queen Bed.   5. Steve, the reception guy and the hotel management tried loot extra money in the name of subject to availability.   6. When we checked online, the room was showing in available.   7. When we showed some strictness and complained about service, they allotted us the remaining 2 room ASAP before check in time. If we weren’t have fought, they would have charged extra for 2 other rooms.   8. For 2 rooms which they allotted early after complaining, they were first saying it will be given by 2 PM then they did it ASAP.   9. Jamaal was splendid and managed us very well during our stay at hotel",0

40924,Worst Hotel I’ve ever been in…  Damp. Smelly. Dirty.. just a few of the things I can say about this place…  What it needs is a bulldozer…  Needless to say we will avoid this at all costs.. our travel company have also been informed…  Rat boxes in the lounge should have summed this place up on arrival..  rooms are dated and mouldy… no wonder there was dehumidifiers on every landing and in all rooms…  The only positive thing about it was the pillows were comfy…,0
41004,My Louis Vutton purse was stolen while INSIDE the hotel. I never left the hotel from the time of paying for my room at the front desk when I had my purse until the next morning  when I discovered my purse was stolen. I have been extremely disappointed at the lack of response and no action from management. After 4 emails to their info email I have received no response.  I travel the world this has never happened. I will never stay at this or other hotels in this chain again. ,0
41164,"Incompetent staff.  I had made a booking for a weeks stay and then cancelled it a month prior as I found the original place I had stayed at a few years ago.  I rang to cancel the accommodation and they could not find my booking.  Fast forward a month and they charged me $215 for a no show.  When I queried it to management they said their error, they had not spelled my name correctly in the booking (which I had spelled several times to them, it's not that complicated a name).  They said they would refund me however still on their high horse that they still had every right to take the money from my account as I did not show up!!! How does that work?  They made the error yet still think it's their right to charge me - Incompetence all round. Would not recommend dealing with this venue.  Try Veriu around the corner who are exceptional on all aspects, including customer service!",0

Robert was not very helpful and told us to  park at a location 10mins away.. there is no way I’m going to walk that distance late at night. He then accused me of having too many people (two adults and a child) for a king room, when I had actually booked a deluxe (their biggest room). I asked that they cancel my reservation as the parking situation did not suit my family and I - with zero empathy he canceled my reservation and charged me $300. Well done Robert.",0
42059,"This hotel may have the best facilities and maintenance in mainland China, but their services are the worst I ever had.  On the 15th night, I order some food delivery to the hotel. When the driver arrived he told me the staff at the main lobby was not allowed to put the food inside of the lobby. I just went downstairs to pick up my food, but I saw there was a barbeque delivery put on the concierge desk. I feel that I might fall into some unfair situations. I called the service center to ask why food delivery could not put into the lobby? She said caused by safety considerations. I mentioned why I saw another food delivery put on the deck which is inside of the lobby. She said another customer signed an indemnity form so he had the right to put the food inside the lobby. I asked her to send me the same form immediately I also want to sign it, after 35 mins, a concierge officer sent it to my room. Although I signed the form, I still had some doubts about it. The form only mentioned if I bring and eat the food delivery inside the hotel，they will not respond to any negative consequences caused by the  food delivery ，but not mentioned the duty of the concierge at all. It‘s just about the outside food， but my concern was why the food cannot put in the lobby. I made an assumption based on the form I signed that if I pick up the food directly from the driver and eat it in the hotel, the hotel has the duty to respond  any negative impact caused by the outside food. Because I don't need to sign the form if I pick up my food directly, the hotel still has the responsibility for my food safty. It makes sense, right? Another assumption is that if the document I signed which also signed by other customers is a common form，would they need 35mins to prepare？  Moreover，I order another food delivery before I check out，and my food is still put outside of the hotel. I obey the hotel rules that signed the form and put my room number and name on the receipt of the delivery. However, there is nothing different since I signed the form. It proves St.Regis Zhuhai does not do as they said, they give me the rules but they don’t obey the rules at all. They tried to rationalize their mistake rather than making an effort to change it. I think fair, justice and honest should be the basic principles for all industries, but St.Regis Zhuhai did not make me saw any of these in their services and operations.",0
42145,"I am a frequent guest at The St Regis Macao, and recently stayed there for three nights, and they did a wonderful job. A week later, I turned to the brand new St Regis Zhuhai, but it was huge disappointment.   LOW QUALITY OF SERVICE. At the time of check-in, first I asked about my upgrade request. The staff have noticed that our reservation was made long ago, however she made a weird comparison saying my rate was a low one, and other guests pay more, therefore our request cannot be fulfilled. I figured how was that my fault by making reservation early?! Not to mention my rate was just an regular best available rate, rather than a non-commissionable one.  Then I said I want to have my breakfast in room next day, the staff told me that they do not currently deliver in-room service, which I later found out it was a lie, as I saw staffs carrying dining cart using the guest elevator multiple times.  I have specifically mentioned that my mother would be celebrating her birthday during our stay, both at the time of reservation as well as the email exchange with the butler team prior to check-in. At the end, no greeting, no birthday card, simply NOTHING.   LOW CAPACITY. The hotel occupies the 41st to 71st floor of the Zhuhai Centre. I have never experienced that all the hotel guests took elevators floor by floor to look around venues across the hotel, just like visiting a museum. Hence, the guest elevator were fully occupied throughout the entire stay, it was super crowded.  All the restaurants were full as well. I mentioned earlier that I was not able to have my breakfast in room, therefore I went to the restaurant with no choice, where there were long lines of guests waiting for the table. Apparently, the hotel is unable to house all the guest at the same time.   LOW SPG RECOGNITION. Throughout our stay, they have completely disregarded my Platinum status, as well as the birthday amenity request. With a lower rate, I rather stay at the Sheraton next door, where I had much more pleasant experience there, without any compromise. And unlike the St Regis Macao, there is no happy hour offered for Platinum members.   This is by far the worst St Regis experience I ever had. ",0
42197,Pros: 1) Location next to mall 2) Location near convention center CONS: 1) Extremely obnoxious reservation agents 2) LOUD music from the Mai Tai grill at the Mall until 1 am 3) Extremely busy lobby 4) Very hard to get in and out of this hotel if you have a car or need an Uber 5) Small rooms 6) Very noisy area with Harley bikes and modified mufflers.,0
42236,"Extremely disappointed. I booked a room with 1 king bed and when I arrived to check in there were no king bed rooms available. They reception put me in what was an ""upgrade"" whihc was a 2 queen bed room. When I opened the door there was someone else's clothes and personal items strewn about. I returned to the front desk to let them know that the room was not clean. Again they re-assigned my room but the only one available in the whole hotel was a only available for one night and  I would need to change it the next day ( my stay was for 3 days) This room was even smaller only 1 queen bed. The next day first thing around 7 am I returned to the front desk to check into the king room which I had reserved and they were charging me for. This new front desk person said that the king rooms were fully booked until after my stay and none were available even though I had a reservation for one. The ""best"" that they could do was put me in another room with 2 queen bed - however this one had the lanai door screwed shut. 3 hotel rooms in 12 hours, each one worse than the last. I would not recommend this hotel as they do not stand behind their own bookings - deeply disappointed and this is kapu for their business.",0
42408,"When we get in to our standart basic room, in the evening, we first met the dirty spots on the carpet.  The room was terribly small. This room type may be a double room for single use. There was no wardrope in the room. I think shower and toilet was placed insted of the wradrope.  The shower&toilet was covered by dirty glass and even there was no certain on the shower glass. Our expectation was just a clean, simple hotel in central Tokyo. But, this hotel does not meet our expectations. For the first night, it was late to move to an other hotel, but next morning we left it and move to an other hotel.  The only good thing was staff. They tried to do their best: they cancelled our rooms and refunded the fees, as we asked.  ",0

Services were nice but the problem was happened when I checked out.  On 12th Apr, a reception woman charged different amount to my credit card against the receipt. When I asked her to explain the gap, she said ""it's small amount."" I took it that ""No need to take care the gap because of small amount."" It's not reasonable for me to charge different amount. It doesn't matter small or not. The amount which was charged to me is different from the receipt without reasonable explanation. It's matter for me. Finally she couldn't give enough explanation and she canceled 1st charge and re-charged correct amount same as the receipt.  The same issue was happened again on 15th Apr, my 2nd stay. At that time she said same explanation ""it's small difference.""  It made me uncomfortable. When you stay here, you should pay attention the amount. Otherwise you will spend your money more than correct amount.",0
42612,"Okay, I am going to start off by saying I did not stay at the location but from looking at other reviews for this place, this seems to be more common an occurrence than normal.  I booked a room almost a month in advance of my trip through a reputable hotel booking site.  Confirmations made and my CC charged for the night.  10PM the night before I was flying out, I received notification that Bars B&B had overbooked and that my reservation had been cancelled.  Nothing like finding out a few hours before you are going to fly that you no longer have a hotel to stay at when you arrive.  I called them up and the hotel basically replied that they knew nothing about what I was talking about, although I had called an confirmed with them nearly a month in advance.  Not sure what they did but guessing they found someone willing to pay more for the room and they just decided to cxl my reservation at the last minute.  So just saying, buyer beware when it comes to these smaller establishments, even if they confirm/commit, they may just back out at the last minute.  Fortunately booking.com found me another room and are refunding me the added expense.  Ended up staying at a nicer place, on the beach.  Just didn't need the last minute stress and frustration that these guys caused me.  Kudos to Booking.Com for fixing me up",0

43490,"I am a professional Santa and had been entertaining guests all day at major Suzhou attractions (Not the kempenski). We decided to go for dinner and a weekend hotel stay and went to their restaurant for seafood first. We were very tired, cold and hungry. This was a reservation at 6:30pm   We arrived in the lobby and couldn't find a single staff member speaking English. What we did find was several girls laying on the tables either on their phones or apparently asleep. See my photos. We finally found the restaurant and arrived to the restaurant to find it stinking of old oil and smelly seafood. Trash was all over the floor and this was at 6:30pm..not the end of the night. They were out of most featured entrees. Check out the disgusting picture of their ""Christmas Turkey"". We sat and waited for thirty minutes but all they had was greasy cold inedible garbage for Christmas. Look at the seafood picture! 30 minutes and ole room temperature tiny crab leg. In all this time, their customer service never greeted us..never came to our table. It was a rude, disgusting and unsettling experience.  When the table behind us started loudly burping and throwing more food onto the floor, we took all we could take of the stench, bad food and terrible diners...and cancelled our room reservation. The waitress tried to charge us when we left after eating nothing and never even being offered a drink.  So we had no dinner...we had to cancel our room because we were so disgusted and disappointed. This was a terrible experience and I'll never ever go there again. We took a car to the W after and got treated correctly. This was shameful for a supposed luxury hotel.",0

43556,"I stayed in Kempinski early November 2015. First, the deposit was still on hold when I contacted my bank, even though they promised it was returned to my bank account immediately. Secondly, they put some else's costs on my room. I found it out at the check-out and pointed it out and wanted to discussed with their manager.   Grace Qian, very rudely told me that she was the manager on duty, no one else I could complain to, I had to wait until they sorted out their mess, although she admitted I had nothing to do with the bill, it was a mistake, according to their records. Literally, she waited my half-an-hour for nothing! Unbelievable, it happened in a very well-known hotel with excellent reputation!   So, be careful about what you were told at the Front Desk of the hotel, especially about the deposit using credit card. When they say the deposit will be returned to your bank account, it might not be true. Also, check your bill carefully when you check out, some items do not belong to you might end up at your bill - because of their poor internal management system!  Good luck",0
43697,"During our first night there, I woke up at 4:30 am because a bug was walking on my back and neck. It turns out that it was a tick. I woke up and took off all the covers to find out that there were many bugs walking around our sheets. We run to the reception, where the night auditor gave us another room at 7:00 (which he cleaned himself and we thank him for that) since it was the only one available. Later in the morning we met with the person in charge of the place and he apologized and told us that we could stay in the new room and also get a refund of our first night there. On our third day, we returned to our room for a small break from outdoor activities and my boyfriend started having some sort of reaction. We went to the pharmacy and they told us that it is from a bug biting me. Even though they gave us medication, and we went out and about and had fun, once we returned to our room my boyfriend started having the same reaction this time on his neck. We ended up in the hospital at night, where the doctor told us that she believes it is from the bugs in our bed in our hotel room. We went back to the hotel and the night auditor was kind enough to give us clean sheets for our bed. The next day was our check out and when we talked to the person in charge about what happened and how we ended up in the hospital in the middle of the night, not only he didn't apologize but also he was very aggressive towards us. He grabbed our suitcase and demanded that he give us a free transport to the port. When he realized we hadn't booked a transport already with him, he just let us go and he denied the offer.",0

Only saw the elite check in staffed once. Only 1 elevator was working which meant very long waits and no elevator social distancing and the banquet food was horrible.

44459,"Earlier this summer around Memorial Day, we stayed at the Chicago Downtown Marriott Magnificent Mile. Suite nights awards were, as usual, denied. No lounge. No breakfast. I had made reservation to make sure that we had sleeper sofa for our nine year old daughter...however, the room we were put in was tiny, and clearly did not have a sleeper. We were moved without too much difficulty.   The state of the room left something to be desired however. Besides being well worn, the sliding bathroom door would not stay shut and some of the lights did not work. All minor complaints so far. However, we were there during unseasonably cold weather. Our room was quite cold and had dropped down to about 60-62 degrees, so I tried to set the thermostat to a warmer temperature. Oddly, this did not seem to help. After a freezing cold night, I sent in a service request to the front desk. We got back to the room after a day out and it was still oddly cold. Despite being set for heat and continuous fan, there was no heat being put out. I called the front desk again...this time they brought up some blankets. The next day, I went to the front desk personally, and heard other guests complaining about the cold. I found out something that astounded me...if they had the hotel set for A/C as they did, it did not matter what you did with the thermostats...there was no individual control of heat in the hotel. They did not turn on the heater for the hotel so there was no heat anywhere! None of the guests were pleased about this. This situation apparently happens often enough that the hotel has to maintain a supply of portable space heaters. Of course, they were out so none for us. I specifically requested non-feather blankets and duvets for our ""camping out"" adventure. Four different times were we brought feather! OMG. We also found out that we had to specifically request maid service to get any service. A little research shows that this hotel was notorious for this climate control problem!   And now a complaint about Marriott Corporate. You would think there would be some benefit to being Titanium Elite! But you would be wrong. Late checkout is ""guaranteed""...but only subject to availability. Huh? What does guaranteed mean then? The ""huge"" benefit of Suite Night Awards sounds attractive...five free nights of suite upgrades. I have ten nights. You know how many I have been able to use ever? Zero. It doesn't matter what brand, from Marriott to Courtyard to Renaissance, or what city from Dallas to Chicago to New York...denied EVERY TIME even though requests have been placed months in advance. These hotels were not even resorts in exotic destinations...just regular hotels, and were not at full capacity. This is such a SCAM! I have probably requested the Suite upgrades 10 times this past year. DENIED each and every time. The kicker is that they then expire at the end of the year. I called Marriott customer service and was told there was nothing they could do about it.  To advertise a benefit such as Suite Night upgrades that have actual monetary value and then to continually deny the use of such benefits is at the very least misrepresentation verging on criminal fraud.",0

There is absolutely nothing 5 stars with this hotel; from the neighborhood it is located in to the lack of cleanliness of the rooms, we were disappointed on all fronts. The breakfast buffet in the morning was more than basic and over-crowded.  When we first got to the hotel, everything was fine at the check-in and we had two employees bring our backs to our rooms (we booked two rooms for our family). In one of the rooms, the floor was visibly dirty and the rooms were smaller than advertised. There was a problem with the shower door, as in when you took a shower, you flooded your whole bathroom. We had to go tell the front desk twice to get this fixed and the second time we were told that this was the design of the shower (if it was truly the case, why was the flood only in one of the rooms we booked and not both?). Be aware that they also take forever to go make the rooms, and we were told they had until 17.30 to make them. When they make the rooms, they simply pull the sheets back, fold the towels and that's about it. They left pillows on the floor and didn't hang back the bathrobes.  We also had a car in the parking and it was extremely long to get our car every time because the valets were also the bellhops and were bringing the luggages to guests together (it was always a team of 2, therefore there were two valets/bellhops).  As for the pool and such, we didn' try any of the extras the hotel offers but be aware that the pool is more like a big bathtub.

47016,Worst check in Experience! Should be noted I didn’t actually check in ! Don’t be a U.S. government worker or black American on leisure travel !   Was told since I work for the Government i needed to book my leisure travel through NGIS . Never heard of that in my life ! The receptionist was definitely profiling me !   I ate at the restaurant many times In past  but need a official government travel booking for a one night leisure stay ???   Don’t book if your Black and maybe a US government worker,0
47441,"Hi, we are a return guest of 3 adults and 1 toddler. We chose to stay at U Pattaya because the room was beautiful and clean and the breakfast was amazing when we visited back a few months ago. However, this time our experience was completely different and we would never go back to U Pattaya or its franchise again as we believe with the price range, we can get better services. We hope these comments will provide you some insight so you can make sure other guests are happy during their stays.  THE ROOM  - when we arrived this time on Thursday the 7th and checked in at 7pm, we expected that we would get a clean room after such a late arrival but the patio stank with cats urine. The hotel staff wasn't bothered but only apologized to us.  Once we used the shower and the bath, the water heat was so hot that the pipe did hurt our skin. Please look into this as it burned one of our family members. We were lucky enough that it didn't hurt our child.   THE BREAKFAST - Last time we were so impressed that the breakfast line was full of variety of food choices. This time we went in around 8.30am and it was almost empty. I'm just wondering why you don't refill as there are other guests who haven't eaten? You served us some soy milk from the bottom of the pot. We ordered some eggs and had to wait for almost half an hour. .. why? We expect to have the same standard quality of service with such price but you can't keep up at all.  Overall we didn't have a good experience here during our last stay. We were so disappointed and actually quite upset that it was the way it was. Hope this will help you with your future guests.  Thanks",0
47446,Room was too bad to hear the other room noise during the night my son awake because the noisy from the next door. I called to tell problems to front desk they were also can hear the noise through the phone. They’ve tried to warn the guests next door as we heard. But it s not all their fault. If the villa too close to each other then the hotel should seperate the zone to make it private not just maximize the room until forget about privacy,0
47449,Room was dirty and lack of proper housekeeping service. The air conditioning was so loud at night and smelly. The staff were lack of standard and need to take extra miles if they want be in hospitality industry. ,0
47463,"Hi.. I live In Guangzhou and was very excited when The Rosewood opened here! From my experiences at other rosewood Hotels worldwide , it’s one of the best hotels! However , I am truly disappointed with Rosewood Guangzhou ! I have eaten at Brick lane, Patina and Black iron but the service has been really disappointing ! The staff are not very welcoming and their english is not the best ! Every time we have been , some drinks have not been available and we are always asked to select an alternative !   They always ask us for a minimum spend at brick lane and too high ! Even if it’s 2 people , they try to insist on a minimum spend to get a table! We bought the blue card membership in hope of getting some perks but you are treated no differently ! We will not be buying this card again! We have been to all the 5 star hotels in Guangzhou and I would rate Rosewood to have the worst service !",0
47472,Experience a bad situation while enquiring for reservation for Too High. The operator by the name Vincent was so rude and unprofessional while answering the enquiries and simply not any Rosewood service standard that i had experience before since i frequently visited this property after they open.Went further to complain about his attitude to the Duty Manager Vanessa and was also unprofessional on her explanation protecting towards his own staff.The apology was never felt and simply blush off the situation with a rushy tone. Seriously!!! This is absolutely ridiculous.  Never going back again.  I was surprise that the call was made using her own mobile phone and i am scared that the privacy had been compromise without my acknowledgement.,0
47477,This is my third time staying at this hotel and I am extremely shocked at what I found. I stayed in room 10221 and when I arrive in the room I went to the restroom. I found blood stain on top of the toilet seat...... I went down to their front desk on the way out and asked them to clean the blood stain. I think a 5 star hotel like rosewood shouldn’t be this unsanitary. Then when I went back to my room at night. I found something even more shocking. Two pieces of curlyish hair most likely “pubes”. I had full body laser hair removal before so I don’t think this is mine...... when I checked out and showed them this. They said sorry and gave me a box of chocolate. I think a 5 star hotel having these issue you should at least tell a duty manager to explain the problem to me. I will never stay here again for the price I payed. I can stay at four seasons or ritz Carlton.,0
47489,"I was at the new bar located on the top and had a very bad experience as the staff was so inexperienced in all matters of service. We ordered a bottle of Belvedere which was very pricy to start with. I had to ask for ice on several occasions as there were no staff offering to help. When we ordered beef sausages they served os the whitest meat ever claiming it was veal. Outside on the open terrace the band member was busy making out with one of the guests which was very awkward. later we escaped down to the 6th floor bar only to have a second even worse experience with a manager called Carol who was a complete joke. No I have warned all my friends not to waste any time or money on this Hotel, nor any of the bars.  What a waste when you have completely incompetent staff at what's supposed to be a 5 star facility.",0
47491,"Room was tastefully decorated, albeit on the small side.   The service was subpar: 1. Checkin: no smile and rigid; 2. During the stay: front desk and guest service hotline always took forever to be picked up; 3. Checkout: we forgot our car key at the front desk, found out the key was missing 5 minutes later and went back to search for it, front desk claims they did not have not it. We ended up searching for it in the room for a long time (without success for sure) and eventually got a spare key elsewhere. We tried to call the hotel the next day, again no one picks up!!! After multiple tries, turns out front desk had it the whole time. No one tried to contact us at any time and it caused us a lot of unnecessary trouble. 4. Restaurant: we had dinner at the Chinese restaurant, food was ok, again service was below average, all the food came out in the wrong order and took forever, they also forgot one dish.   Overall, a very unpleasant and disappointing stay. The staff has not been properly trained and managed. ",0
47896,"It was a very bad experience. There was an emergency in the middle of the night and everyone had to come out of their rooms and go to the ground floor, but no one from reception or any staff was available. Even after realizing that there was no issue and false alarm, staff was not informing all the guests that were standing outside the hotel in the cold. Rooms were dirty and not cleaned everyday properly. Dirty bedsheets and no sweeping or vacuuming on the floor. No dental kit, no universal extension, no courtesy or service. And they call themselves a 4 star??? What a scam!! Please don't don't don't stay here!!!",0
47976,"The ground floor toilet is see through from the men's into the ladies'. There is no tap that runs water to wash hands in the toilet sinks as well, but comparing to the seeing through theme, I think it's just a small issue. What more can I said, the whole experience is horrifying......",0

48100,"I've stayed at low budget hotels in the U.K., that are a better standard than this hotel. I was really appalled. The first room I was given was visibly dirty.   1. Stains on the wall and little pieces of God knows what hanging from the ceiling.  2. The bath itself was rusted and discoloured.  3. The tables were so worn, the laminate from the paint was coming off. Even on the painted fixtures, you could see the paint coming off. Same with the chair, discoloured and falling apart.  4. Unusually hot rooms  On the second night I had the displeasure of seeing insects running across my bed whilst I was in it! So I asked to be moved and boy, it was just as bad.  1. The door didn't close from the outside (no seriously). I had to put my card/key in the door to get the clasp to go into the door to shut. 2. Stains on the ceiling and walls (again) 3. Socket hanging out of the wall 4. Air con didn't work - so almost suffocated in a hot room  Because the air con didn't work, I had to open the awkward window, and the noise was awful. But it was either listen to the noise or sleep in sauna.  The hotel is seriously a shambles. Disgusted really. ",0
48586,"We chose to stay here because of the hotel's proximity to the Louvre. In that respect, the hotel does not disappoint. An easy five minute walk is all it takes to get there. It's also a convenient bus ride (# 48) from Gare du Nord to it. The staff was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the ground-floor room (# 100) we received smelled heavily of mildew. There was little natural light and the colors of the walls added to the rooms gloominess. There was a drain pipe near the door that treated us to a near constant sound of draining water through the night. If I were a younger man, I don't think these things would have been a problem. However, as I am an older man (mid-60's), these deficiencies made the night's stay uncomfortable.",0
48589,I book a room in this hotel but my credit card company blocked the charge. After checking both with this hotel and my credit card company that the booking had not completed successfully I booked somewhere else only to find out days later that the hotel had tried (and successfully) re-charge my card with a (new) authorization on my part. I tried to cancel the new charge but the hotel refused even though this was weeks before my planned stay. ,0

I was so suprised and he was surprised too.All the staffs didn't apolozize and take action for this accident. It was a waste of money for this hotel and I regret to book ,0
48674,"This place is horrible and totally overpriced. The interior is daded, and the place small, dark and cluttered. It is basically a 4 bedroom with two bathrooms, where the rooms are rented out individually. Only one of the rooms has its own bathroom, the remaining rooms have to share one bathroom.  That I found the setup horrid is one thing, but when I decided to cancel my stay the situation developed to the worse. The owner refused to cancel my stay and changed his position from charging a 30% cancellation fee to charging the full amount in cancellation fee. I had to call hotels.com for assistance. They contacted the host, who decided to hang up on them. I decided to leave and booked a 4 star hotel with a rooftop pool just around the corner for appx the same price as overpriced Barcino 147.  The place is a dump and the owner a fraud and I will strongly advise people to stay away from this place.",0

49388,"Be warned! Think before you use the ATM next to the receptionist. It may not give you money, but just book the sum from your account, and eventually you will receive that back a few weeks later. After questioning this practice, and trying to make written complaint about it, the reception chef got mad about it, which ended up in a loud discussion. Note, that none of the personal has a name badge, so in case of any issues, you can not even identify them. To be sure, he even confiscated my mobile phone, to make sure his angry face will not be identifiable later. The mobile phone was returned by the travel agent a few hours later, but the plastic case was partially damaged. The hotel, neither the personal was not taking any responsibilities for this. The travel agent wanted to reject a complaint about it, but on the last day, finally made a protocol. They denied any actions and any responsibilities. Due to these experiences, despite of the lots of effort this hotel make to justify themselves as a 4-star hotel, I cannot recommend it.",0
49688,"Never happen on my experience. Write an email request and remind I booked twin bed but front staff rejected and just say not twin bed!!! I was telling him and show him my email and he rejected to see. At the end , he might find it and say ok, then twin bed!! I say we also requested to combine the bed and extra pillow and he didn’t answer! Bad service and bed experience on Skypark. Sure will not back anymore!",0
49857,"We stayed at Melia Athens for two nights. The hotel room I booked said a double bed OR two twins. We were given a double bed, and my 6 foot 4 husband didn’t fit in the bed. I went to the desk and asked for a room with two twin beds instead. He said my reservation didn’t apply to two twin beds, even though it said so in my booking email. He made me pay $33 to “upgrade” to a room with two twin beds.   The room had no coffeemaker — I was told only king suites get a coffeemaker and he said I could upgrade for $60/night. I declined. They brought a kettle to my room so I could heat up water for tea I brought, and the kettle was filthy. I took photos of it. The employees were rude and paying to “upgrade” a room that I already paid for was unacceptable. The hotel was garbage.   We went up to the rooftop bar and asked if we could sit at a table to look at the Parthenon. We were told we couldn’t unless we ordered dinner. Then we watched as two couples with a different skin color than ours were seated at tables with no questions asked. Those couples did not order dinner, only drinks. This is unacceptable. This hotel ended my honeymoon on a really bad note. Absolutely terrible experience.",0

49982,They stole $5000 from us when covid lockdowns were occurring. We gave them $5000 for a suite and the airlines/ Greece ended up locking down days before our trip. first the airlines so even if Greece didn't we couldn't have made it. Expedia and ourselves tried to get them to refund and they refused. so overall we literally handed them $5000 for nothing.,0
50048,"Currently staying at Nefeli Homes, other reviewers are correct that reception desk is always empty. We were promised breakfast and have been waiting over two hours with no food or staff in sight.  Our bed is absolutely terrible, it makes a horrible screeching sound if you even shift an arm or leg, which is quite horrible and irritating on a honeymoon!! Will update at end of visit.",0
50052,"Keep looking - there are plenty of other places in Santorini that offer a view, without the mouldy, damp, dark, outdated, small, chemical smelling rooms. Pay a bit extra and stay somewhere you can actually enjoy! - The photos and information Nefeli Homes provide are completely misleading!  - Pool area is TINY and the pool itself is dirty, and large majority is knee deep. - No management present onsite, only for check-ins. - No information or map provided on the island or area when you check-in.  - Looking at where they serve their breakfast, I would not eat here. - They charge your credit card before you arrive. - The room we were located was underneath the pool, with tiny windows, right next to the public walkway, stunk of strong smelling chemicals and had an air conditioning unit full of mould. - Within ten minutes of being in the room my partner and I were feeling very nauseous. We informed the manager and asked if we could please move to a different room and she told us that we could not as the hotel was fully booked. Since they could not offer us another room for tonight, we then asked if we could get a refund so we could stay in other accommodation. She rang her manager who informed us that a refund was not possible.  Eveidently it became obvious that there was no way we could stay in the room for 2 nights with the smell making us feel ill and we decided to stay elsewhere.  Given these circumstances we thought there could have been a refund given.  When we were waiting for our ride to leave, management went down there to assess the room, and the manager acknowledged the smell and condition of the room yet still wouldn't refund a cent.  It is completely unacceptable to offer a room of this standard to guests, regardless of the price, however given that we were paying 114€ per night, this was not cheap so we were definitely not expecting a room of this extremely poor standard.   We notified booking.com of the situation and they liaised with Nefeli Homes on our behalf but Nefeli Homes still refused to refund us anything. Frankly, this is appalling and we have never experienced customer service like it!  ",0

The room I stayed in smelled funny then some guy sprayed the air freshner to get rid of the odor at the AC that made me stay out of the room for a bit to clear the air. I wouldn't want to breathe the chemicals. A hard bed to sleep in and the weird noise from the toilet was annoying.  Breakfast was not good either. Overall a very unpleasant stay. I'd suggest to find another hotel nearby. The only good thing is Metro near shopping market, convenience store, and shopping malls.",0

50283,"We arrived to the hotel at around 12am and checked in. In the first room, the bed had no headboard and we were told 'thats the style' but every other room had a headboard? We were so tired at this point and finally got moved. The man who came to move us rooms was so very rude, and did not even say hello to us, he just seemed angry. We moved rooms only to find that AC doesn't work and we were told another lie, 'that it has been turned off for whole of Italy and is not allowed'. The rooms were so dirty, and there was a studio kitchen but no mugs, plates or cutlery? What was the point?   We then went to sleep, the bed was like a camper bed, we did not sleep the whole night. My partner had serious back issues the next morning. It was a horrible nights stay and my partner and i were considering booking a flight back home to the UK. We spoke to the manager and asked if there were any rooms with better beds, and the manager said no. We said ok please could we be refunded for the awful nights stay and told her all our issues. She listened and said we would need to contact the 3rd party (Traveluro) to request the refund and she would approve. So thats what we did. We rang them and the agency told us to ask reception to start the refund, we went back to find the manager hiding in the back office and the woman on reception called Mia who was so rude. We asked her to get us the manager and she refused and continued serving other people and taking phone calls whilst we were trying to talk to her. She was so rude. The travel agency were still on the phone listening to all this. The manager told Mia to refuse the refund after saying she would give us a refund on our booking. We asked if the manager would speak to the agency to make things easier, but Mia let us know thats not possible. After 2 hours the manager finally came out, and she refused to speak to the travel agency? And then tried to say theres another Italian agency who have to start the refund, it was all lies.   The travel agency heard all of this on the phone and how the hotel refused to be of any help and they themselves refunded us out of good will as they heard the ridiculous situation. They were great and i recommend booking through Traveluro.   We then had to book another hotel last minute for the rest of our holiday, and guess what... AC worked there! So AC being turned off for the whole of Italy was a complete lie.   My partner also had to book a massage in Milan, and spend more money because he was in so much pain from the uncomfortable bed. I could not move my neck for 2 days.   We wasted more than half a day of our holiday because of Ramadas awful customer service and incompetence.

You ask for a omelette they charge u 12 Euro without informing you. No view as such from d room. No chairs in d balcony. Will not stay here again. ,0
51280,"I'm currently staying at the hotel in the plaza suite and it's definitely the worst Shangri La I've stayed at. I had already switched from a different unpleasant hotel experience this trip so was willing to look over this Shangri-la's outdated interior and weird smells... but tonight when I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth there was a cockroach hanging out just next to my toothbrush!  Managed to catch the cockroach under a cup and take some photos and videos of it. I'm not usually afraid of bugs but this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel and cockroaches are extremely unsanitary. I understand if it were a motel on ground floor, not a room on a 20-something floor at a luxury hotel. They offered in room dining credit & a deep clean during next housekeeping but isn't that something that should've been done prior to a guest stay? I don't think I'll ever stay here again. ",0
51428,"Our first met with the host was a disaster! I don’t feel the hospitality! We understood we might make a mistake that caused her trouble, we apologised; there was no need kept on repeating, nagging and lecturing us during out first met conversation! We are not barbarian! Her attitude as such was really spoiled our holiday mood! My family felt unhappy with this kind of service!  The B&B owner not even introduce herself but unhappy, kept on complaining we did not inform her our arrival time, not answer her emails, she had been waiting us for hours blah blah blah during our first met.   I have stayed in other B&B before, the hospitality of the previous host and so many positive reviews of this B&B in Tripadvisor made my decided to stay in this B&B. But, the attitude of this host was eyes opened for me!  We reserved rooms in this B&B via Booking.com. There is no information mentioned that the B&B guests have to inform the host their arrival time neither in Booking.com nor B&B website. We were extremely busy with work until the day before our vacation. Rome was not the first stop during our vacation. How can we answer email during our vacation as the check-in time mentioned in Booking.com is from 13:00 to 20:00?  She not in a good mood to give us a ""nice"" introduction for example the interesting places to visit; she was circling the places on the map in light speed as she just wants to get rid of us.   During the premises explanation tour, she did not miss a chance to satirise us for not checking and answering her emails, reminding us this is not a hotel but B&B, lecturing us what differences between a hotel and B&B, nagging how tired she was as she had to woke up at 6am because a group of guests arrived at around 6am blah, blah, blah.  Is this the way a B&B host treated their guests?   We actually looking forward the host will recommended us places for a budget and good meals, but her attitude made us no mood to have more conversation and the rest period of our stay.  We did not have a good night sleep during out stay. The rooms are a big nightmare for light sleepers like us; we ended up sleep with earplugs!   In Booking.com, it mentions the rooms are soundproofing. No, they are not! The traffic noise can be heard clearly as early as 6am with windows closed tight, the conversation of others can be heard clearly even the rooms are facing the yard. This is not soundproof room!  In Booking.com, it says rooms are air-conditioned. No, it is an air cooler instead air conditional, and generating bloody loud noise. The host informed us Italians sleep with windows open, there is no need any air conditioning. She has the air cooler unit in the room just because of the tourists. Yes, she is expecting all her B&B guests should sleep like Italians.  The worst, when the air cooler was turned on, no other electronic devices should be plugged in the power plugs. If not, the whole floor will be black up.  This B&B is near to metro line A, about 5 minutes walking distance from the San Giovanni metro station. The B&B rooms are facing to a yard.  The size of double bedrooms is reasonably big; the room facilities are basic, and a mini bar in the room. The toilet, bathroom and toiletries are standard.  The breakfast is served in the room; the host prepares and brings the breakfast to the room in the morning between 8 to 9:30am. An early breakfast can be arranged. The breakfast is basic; the breakfast coffee is not freshly brewed but instant coffee.  I rarely wrote strong negative review about hotels & B&B I stayed, as I believe owners have their difficulties for fulfilling every requirement from their guests. However, this B&B host was really ruined our stay and vacation!",0
51554,I heard very good things about the shangri-la hotel. I was looking forward to my stay. What can be better than a 5 star hotel with 5 star service? Nothing except this hotel is not 5stars in any way or foam. Maybe back in 1990 defiantly not in 2019!  I checked in at 10am. The receptionist put a $200 hold on my credit card. I picked up my room keys (my room was not ready at 10am) the receptionist put an additional $730 hold on credit card without telling me. My room was already paid for in advance. I don’t know why they feel like I would spend or break $1k in 2 nights unless this is a scam the hotel is running. Hoping people won’t notice the second hold and pushing it through as a charge.   The receptionist cancel the $730 charge after I yelled and complain about the charges.  I ask for a non smoking room and my room smelled like a cigarette box. I couldn’t air it out because the fan wasn’t working. The mattress is hard as a rock. I woke up every morning with a stiff neck and backache. Food at the hotel was pricy and gross.   They have a metal detector in the lobby. I had to go through it every time I enter the hotel. It was a lot of fun getting scan and patted down. The X-ray machine has a conveyer belt with a very short shelf. There’s no stopper. It just keeps running to the floor. My expensive bag kept getting thrown and drag onto to floor while I get padded down. The extra guards couldn’t care less that my bag was spilling over or toss on the floor!  The hotel also looks old and run down.  Save your money and stay at another hotel. This hotel is not worth the $$$$$,0

51978,"I am a ""Gold"" status member of ALL Accor but I've received very disappointing service-below the standard of the Accor Group-from the Novotel Moscow Kievskaya hotel.  I've received an unfriendly and rude attitude from the one of the receptionists during my check-in process.  I had to wait about 40 minutes to received my room key although I already did the online check-in through the ALL Accor mobile application.  I've already sent a complain e-mail to the hotel but they didn't reply my e-mail.  The superior room they provided did not match my request and my replacement room was actually a downgraded room because it was a room without sofabed. My reservation was a superior room with sofabed. As a Gold status of ALL Accor member, I will have a chance to be given an upgrade room if available. In fact, instead giving an upgraded room they gave me a downgraded room.   My online booking member price through the ALL Accor mobile application was more expensive than the published rate listed on the hotel lobby screen.  Room cleanliness needs to be improved.  It was a very disappointing staycation at Novotel Moscow Kievskaya hotel.",0

Don’t make the mistake of take “the special dinner” of 31st December... 2500 rublos/person of a wannabe nouvelle cuisine. Important issue... you need to prepaid dinner with your reservation... when we saw first dishes we try to stop that s**t and propose the person in charge of restaurant to change to “normal” menu (we saw some people order hamburguers but waitress said that we are lying ... special dinner is the only menu available that night) so, we propose a new solution give our money back and relieve of this crappy meal. No way...  I have paid that so I wanna see the special tragicomedy dinner... cucumber sauce, cold lamb, in a sperpentic mix ... we tasted all of them, I swear. Exception to desert - Walmart chocolate pie or similar...   When drama has been finished , we try to say the waitress we are going ( it’s important to know - since we said waitress and person in charge that we don’t like the food, all of them seemed very nervous and try to avoid our table).  When a customer is not comfortable with your product/ service... you must offer solutions not hide away of them.  Ouh! I forget that we have to paid water (it is not included in 5000 rublos) + 250 rublos  Hope that help to you to be a better host   ",0

(We had a bad experience at a different location of this brand in the past.  I went in and the lady at the counter told me since we had never stayed at THIS location, she would really like to earn our business and they would do whatever it took to do so as she gave us complementary bottles of water and a bag of chips.  Reluctantly, we decided to give this location a chance and stay the night.  We went into the room and the bedding on the beds had a mild, musty wet dog odor and when we opened the sleeper sofa to make the bed for our son to sleep on, the soiled linens were in the bed from the last guest.

After a night out I came to hotel before 12.00 pm to be advised that I need to empty my room and go … the room was not being used . I mentioned previous calls and was told “I’ve got a note to say you need to go! “ Th receptionist from the night before (Milan) has since left business !   The team at hotel had no one to refer to they told me and I had to go … I called the agency who tried to sort but against told I had to leave .. eventually things were sorted but not without waiting a round an hour.

Then, the icing on the cake was being evacuated from the hotel at 4am because of a fire alarm.  Apparently it was caused by SOMEONE SMOKING IN THEIR ROOM! I am not blaming Travelodge but I can see little advising people not to smoke in the rooms. Smokers are notoriously ignorant of no-smoking rules and need it spelling out to them sometimes, as should have happened here, especially if it results in the whole hotel being evacuated in the middle of the night and then having to stand in the wet and cold for over an hour in pyjamas.

However on return was informed this room had be given away to someone else because I did not move that morning. I would have done if that had been communicated to me.  I checked out and had the rest of my stay at the Vibe Hotel round the corner. A fantastic hotel worthy of its 4  'star' rating on Trip Advisor.

They assured me it was not problem and I asked specifically if anyone else had an active key to the room and If I could go to sleep assured that no one else would come back into the room that night. The reception assured me the room was all one and I had nothing to worry about. After a long flight from Europe I was looking forward to some undisturbed sleep. An hour away I was wokened up by a Japanese fella who thought he could sleep there. There was an awkward moment of confusement and he left without an explanation.

This place was mediocre on its best day, and downright terrible otherwise.  We experienced an assortment of issues whilst staying here: The hotel is listed as multilingual but English-speakers are very difficult to come by. The food is tolerable, but not very tasty and often cold. The service at the restaurants, patisserie and bars is acceptable but quite “dry”. There are no irons available in the rooms and if you require clothing to be ironed it must be done by the laundry service, which charges by item and at least €3 per article of clothing. The laundry service also has to be requested the morning of, so there is no express service or possibility of having something ironed on short notice.  Our room door was opened by staff attempting to attach a sign to our door at 10pm at night. The cocktails are horrible, there seems to be no natural juices available at the hotel. The a la carte restaurants at the hotel require bookings approximately 2 days in advance and though “all inclusive” they charge an additional fee. The wifi is spotty throughout the hotel and often just does not connect. The Air Conditioning did not work in our room and when we inquired we were told that it doesn’t work in the entire building. The temperature could only be set by one person and that person had to choose whether to use a warm temperature or a cold one depending on guest feedback. They offered a WhatsApp service to ask questions and queries but again because of the language barrier this proved futile. They also took five days to answer one of the questions we asked.  A massive disappointment. ",0

54702,"SUMMARY: LOUD PARTYING GROUP, PARKING 4 BLOCKS AWAY $20, SHARED BATHROOMS, VERY LOUD WOODEN FLOORS AND STEPS.  I was very pleasantly greeted by Ricardo which made me feel good about things, but the good feeling stopped shortly after. Here's why:  1-No parking at hotel, was told to pay $20 to park 4 blocks away, and walked in the rain.  2-Very loud noisy partying neighbor (this was only Tuesday), and noise continued till 215am (party in the room till after 1am, until I called to complain) then from repeated shared bathroom use and climbing up and down the steps every 5 min. Hotel has practically no insulation and the wooden floors and steps are very loud when used. The floor noise continued till way after 2am.  3-When I called the owner at 1254am to complain, he first said it's still early and then he told me to get involved myself and ask them to be quiet (Really? Not a good idea). Besides, earlier when I saw one of the group partiers (while using the bathroom) and asked them to keep the noise down, all I got was ""we'll do whatever we want. We paid for our room too""... They practically threatened me. That's when I called to complain.  4-The hotel description never mentioned the bathroom would be shared.  5-Lots of smoking by the pool when I went to heat up some food in the microwave (that's where it's at).  While I didn't enjoy the stay at all, and didn't sleep all night, I will be fair and mention some good parts about the place for this to be a complete review. 1-The room was very clean 2-Room temp was pleasant 3-The front desk/owner was very nice and greeted me nicely, but not very helpful after the mentioned problems started.  I finished writing this at 246am because I can't sleep anymore at this hotel after all the noise issues. I'm too stressed out.   I may consider removing this review with a full refund so I can forget about this experience.",0

54713,"After eight years of married life with two kids, my husband and I finally arranged a night away, just us, for the first time.  We arrived and parallel parked directly in front of the business.  We checked in with the front desk clerk, collected our room key, and went up to our room.  About two hours later, we got ready to go out to dinner.  When we got to the front of the business, we noticed our car was gone.  We immediately asked the clerk if he had seen anything.  After asking if we had a red car (we did) he said ""oh....they towed it...""  At no point at check in did the clerk give us a parking pass - at no point did he even ask if we had a car.  When we explained all of this to the clerk, and asked for his assistance in getting our car back, we were directed to wait while the clerk phoned him.    After a 20 minute wait, the clerk handed us the phone with the manager on it.  Before we could even begin to explain the situation, the manager began berating me for our ""stupidity,"" claiming that I was an ""American and should know that parking isn't free.""  The $280 fee we paid to get our car back - after immediately checking out, dragging our luggage a mile, and paying the $6 fee to take cash out of an ATM because the tow company wouldn't accept a check or credit card - was nothing compared to the atrocious customer service.  We didn't expect the manager to pay for the towing fee, but the manager's vicious attitude toward us, without even a hint of an apologetic tone for the nightmare we experienced as a result of the clerk's negligence, makes this bed and breakfast unworthy of any future business from any discerning consumer.",0
54747,"We decided to do a quick trip to Florida arriving 2/21 and departing on 2/27.  On February 17th, I reserved one night at the Sobe You B&B for February 25th. On the night of the 24th, my husband came down with a respiratory flu with a fever of 103.5.   We were in the Florida Keys and I was able to find a physician that could see him; he was prescribed 3 medications and we were told he would be very ill for at least two more days and that we would not be able to fly home on the 27th.  At 8:14 a.m., I called the Sobe You & spoke with Raul; I apologized and explained the situation and he said we probably would not get a refund.  We later received an e-mail confirming that.  I replied explaining that my husband was too ill to travel & offered to send them the note from the doctor that we had to give the airlines to reschedule a later flight.  I did not get a reply.  On 2/27, I called again, this time talking with Kadi.  I asked if they had received my e-mail and she said she'd check later; I had not given my name yet & so I asked her if that wouldn't be required.  She said to re-send the e-mail which I did.  It is now 3/2 & I still have not received a reply.   I completely understand the issues with last-minute cancellations and the non-refund policies but since this is a situation beyond our control, I would expect at the least an offer to use the money at a later date.  We lost $234.36 on this for an event that was not our choice.  If we could have travelled we would have been at the Sobe.  In the conversation with Raul, he stated they require a 30-day cancellation; I pointed out that would have been difficult since the reservation had only been made the prior week.  Due to their poor policies & the lack of a response, I would encourage others to stay at any other place than this B&B.",0
54851,"This hotel is so poorly run. The front desk and many employees of this establishment simply don't care what the patrons wants and needs are. The 2 women who work at the front desk never make eye contact nor do they try to accommodate the needs of the guests that I observed. There were issues with the rooms. The plumbing is old and there was rust all over the flush in my first room which the room had an odor of sewage and an infestation of ants and mosquitos. When I complained about it they tried to give me a room which was a down grade from my original room, it wasn't until I spoke to the manager that they gave me a ""better"" room but the air conditioning wasn't working properly. At that point I was already over the hotel.   This hotel is NOT All Inclusive. When you go to the beach, the beach bar makes you pay for alcoholic beverages. I even saw the wait staff charge some of the guests for water and other beverages and pocket the money at the beach bar.  The food can be monotonous and they are very strict with dining hours. I wish they were as strict with the maintenance of the guest rooms. The towels are old and dingy. They don't use real mops to clean. The sheets and pillows are terrible!!!  THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!",0

55337,"I had a reservation the first weekend of March at this hotel.  I booked it using free night reward certificates.  I had a double queen booked for 3 adults.  Upon arrival at the hotel I was greeted by the clerk Katrina with ""hello Ms. ___ I see you are using free rewards certificates for your stay with us"". I confirmed this.  She then proceeded to tell me that they only had a king ... obviously that is not going to work since there were 3 adults including my son so we were not sleeping in one bed!  She told me I could wait and maybe in 1 hour, maybe 2 or maybe longer there would be something available .  This did make sense to me since I had ""checked in"" on my app to my hotel and it showed the double queen.  Anyway, I sat a little over an hour in the bar/restaurant adjacent to checkin.  Then I asked for an update.  Katrina said here is what we are going to do, I have a double in the Elements Hotel and its actually a nicer room than you reserved and we will just give you that room.  I asked where the Elements Hotel was and she said it was in the same building.  So she took me up one floor to that check in counter and went behind the counter and checked me in.  What she DID NOT tell me is she actually CANCELED my existing reservation, and rebooked a reservation at the Elements Hotel which was a more expensive room and just took 100k of my Marriott Bonvoy points and used them.  SHE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME SHE DID THIS, I DID NOT AUTHORIZE THIS.   I only found out late the next day when I saw my account confirmation.  Also, I was charged for a valeted car and a refueling????  I didn't have a car I flew in and took an Uber.  I have been trying since 3/5 (today is 9 days later) to have her correct this.   I have spoken to the Hotel Manager Azeem (very nice)  at Elements, I have spoken to Selena (very nice) the front desk manager, I have spoken to Marriott Bonvoy customer relations, I have logged in about 5 hours of calls and I have been informed that I am at the mercy of KATRINA and until she fixes what she did without authorization, no one can change this.  I noticed today she gave me 50k points back and STILL has taken the liverty of charging me with 50k points WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.  Shame on you Aloft Hotel and Elements Hotel for not making sure your employees do their job!",0
55397,"Recently visited hotel best San Francisco with family and whilst the most of the hotels facilities were good  this hotel is a three star hotel but in no way should it be a 4 star, we were greeted by a rude receptionist, the food was very poor and cold if you wanted a warm breakfast you could use one of the two microwaves provided to heat up your ‘hot’ food, the room was small but clean, and the worst part about the hotel was the lifeguard. We have never come across such a rude, aggressive employee in all our travels. He was very aggressive to a member of our party over a flip flop in the pool and when we tried to ask what the problem was he was very aggressive in his mannerisms to the rest of our party. His rules only seem to apply to some, considering the use of balls, diving into the pool or having a glass beside the pool is seemingly prohibited yet nothing was said to guests who did so.",0
55512,"Ibis in Shepherd's Bush was genuinely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I have stayed in Ibis hotels all over the world and appreciate they are budget hotels, but this was absolutely dreadful.  Let's start with the positives. The location was very convenient being over the road from Shepherd's Bush underground. It was also a 5 minute walk to Westfield shopping centre which has every shop and restaurant imaginable.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  The room was a basic Ibis room, but the furnishings were tired and the bed was in desperate need of replacement.  I requested a quiet room both when booking and by email before arriving. Despite this, they assigned me possibly the noisiest room in the hotel. There was a dog above me, so the noise of it moving around echoed due to the hard laminate floors. The toilet cistern leaked, so there was the sound of running water all night. The TV remote was faulty and there was no way to turn off the TV, so it was on for 4 hours at a time.  The following morning, breakfast was appalling. The only hot vegetarian items were scrambled eggs (hard and dry) and hash browns (stone cold in the middle).  I left the hotel extremely tired and hungry. I moved to another budget hotel for the remainder of my stay and it was palatial in comparison.  After complaining to the hotel, they advised that they cannot control other guests. I appreciate this, but they knowingly assigned me a room below a dog when I specifically requested a quiet room. The maintenance issues were also firmly within their control.",0
55797,Came to this hotel on Valentine’s Day with my girlfriend which they started they provide free parking on side. I went to grab food and came back to the hotel and the guy at reception by the name of aladin said there is no parking and that I have to go and park outside in a side road at my own Risk or pay for parking. He woke me and my girlfriend uo at 6am to tell me that my car needs to be moved. Not a great sleep. And I told him there is not parking outside the hotel he said I will need to go and park 15 mins away and walk it back.   Would not recommend this place.,0

At first you should come and don't expect anyone to meet you. Park your car by yourself and walk to the hotel because there is no one at the gate. I checked in. they didn't welcome me. Advice: Don't pay for their restaurants. If you make your own coffee in the room, you will get a better coffee. For the record, I paid 35 riyals for Nescafe with milk. I submitted my complaint to the reception and they told me they would send me a cappuccino. I waited for half an hour and didn't get anything. There is a Starbucks cafe next to the hotel. I advise you to go to it if you want coffee and if you want restaurants, there is a mall very close to the hotel. Since trying this coffee, I have not paid a riyal after that in those restaurants also at the time of my check-out from the hotel. The employee did not ask me about my stay, she just said thank you .",0
56118,It was a very bad experience this time. The room didn’t have towels or enough drinking water and had only 2 sticks of sugar without a spoone or stick.

56605,"I was repeatedly disappointed by the Barjeel guesthouse. The first strike was that the airport pickup I had scheduled never showed. Because I was getting in at 2am, and had read the guesthouse was unknown to taxis, I had specifically scheduled an airport pickup. I spent an hour looking for a driver who wasn't there and attempting to make contact with someone at Barjeel. When I finally reached the staff of their sister property, I was given no explanation as to why the driver didn’t show. Nor did they apologize or offer to send a new driver. At this point, I asked to skip my stay (I was only going to be in Dubai for 24 hours anyways) and be refunded. I was told this was not possible as Barjeel routes all transactions through a third party (Agoda). This should be on Barjeel – not the customer. We have no choice but to pay through whatever mechanism they have set up on the website.   I took a taxi and arrived at Barjeel’s sister hotel around 4am. The rep who I reached on the phone said not to bother asking the taxi driver to take me to Barjeel – they wouldn’t know where to go. So the taxi dropped me off at their sister property. While the night manager was theoretically helping me transfer to a shuttle to at last go to Barjeel, he stopped to help some young men and their prostitutes who rolled up in their Range Rover. These are not classy establishments, people.   I get to Barjeel at last and ask the night manager who I may speak to about getting a refund. He tells me he can’t help me and I’ll have to go back to the sister property. I get to bed at 5 am.   In the morning, there is no one at the front desk. I check 5 times. I ask the woman who had prepared breakfast if I can eat outside on the terrace. She tells me no. I insist that I would prefer to eat outside. We go back and forth on this for several minutes and it is awkward. She tells me she doesn’t want to walk upstairs. I proceed to carry up the dishes and food, and bring them back down, so as not to put her out. Once again, Barjeel was unaccommodating at every turn.   My shower has no hot water and I am underwhelmed by my experience thus far. However, there is no manager to speak with at Barjeel. I go back to the sister property (about a 15 minute walk away).   I proceed to recount the above to 4 people. I was attempting to get an explanation for this unsatisfactory service. I asked for a partial refund to compensate for the unprofessional service at every turn of my stay.   Alas, I was told that Barjeel was a “guesthouse” not a “hotel” so what did I expect? Evidently, one is supposed to infer from “guesthouse” that the standards will be lower than even a youth hostel.   The biggest issue was the lack of any service and management. Who is in charge of the Barjeel guesthouse? I still don’t know because no one ever took responsibility, or offered a partial refund, for this utterly underwhelming stay.",0
56646,"The Restaurant is awful.Extremely disappointing experience. Drinks were fine but the starters were tasteless. The main problem however was the main meal. We ordered a seafood platter... It was over cooked and missing a third of the fishes listed on the menu. We told the manager that the lobster was way over cooked and we were missing fish and vegetables from the platter. He did send out the missing fish and veg after a long wait,again cooked to an unsatisfactory standard. The manager didn't seem to care, about the quality of service and was not apologetic or professional in anyway.Would not recommend this place!",0
56677,"This is the worst hotel that I ever had. Beware of it, especially make you keep all your transaction record with this hotel. It is long story, I started with a service apartment with this hotel back in 2018 and moved out in 2021. To be fair, the service is not bad, but then in summer, one day they told I owed them 1 month rent back in few months ago. I was surprised because I always pay on time and more ridiculous no one ever asked me. I then escalated to the GM and she told me she would look into it. Few days later the staff told me that they had a new policy when renewing the contract (which is six months) and required an additional 1 month deposit. It was a mistake and I didn’t really owe their rent. I thought ok and settled it. Then came the pandemic, I wasn’t able to go to China but still I paid my rent for the 2020 year without actually staying. Finally in 2021,I decided to move out and during checkout no one said anything. They just told me they will return my 2 months deposit in few weeks time. Then came the surprise, they held up my 1 month deposit and insisted that I didn’t pay. All months of discussion, they refused to return the pay and insisted I had to prove to them I paid. This is the most ridiculous experience I ever had and if you are planning to stay at this hotel or anyone in the same group. Beware if the scam and make sure your keep all your records … of course the better way is to avoid them totally",0

I also put in a call to the corporate office to complain, but haven't heard from anything on that end either.

I reserved two rooms for me and my friend, we both had our 'do not disturb' placards on our doors, we were travelling abroad and didnt want someone in our rooms with access to our things - the hotel ignored the signs and cleaned the rooms anyways, and hid the dnd placards.  When I called the front desk to ask why they ignored their own signs, she stated they checked to see if we were sleeping first and they didnt see the problem since we werent there, I then read them the language that is on their dnd door signs which states 'i do not want my room cleaned' - she said sorry and hung up.  Then there's the 'room service' - after decades of travel, I've never seen anything so awful.  I ordered a beef dish with potato salad and a soda, which costed about $40 US - what I received was some rolled up cold lunch meat and potato salad so vinegary it was inedible, it was in a plastic container as if they got the meal from a convenience store take out, this was bad food for the US, let alone Paris, maybe the worst food I've ever had anywhere, and for an outrageous price.  The a/c in my room would shut off for no reason intermittenly and the unit made some horrendous noises as if it was leaking water.

On my 3rd day of stay, an European staff harrassed & followed me back & forth from one side of this hugh kitchen to the other side & wouldn't leave me alone even when told to back off & being told that this was harrassment the very moment I stepped inside the kitchen with my intention to make a cup of tea! From the 1st day of checkin, I have been experiencing a victim of stalkers, deliberately being blocked & inconvenient by guests in my shared room & in communal areas; kitchen, toilet etc. The Fire Alerm sounded nonstop in my room one afternoon, on the only day I fell ill & within half an hour of me falling asleep in bed due to sickness! It scared the only other girl so much in my room at the time, she simply packed up all her belongings & left the room instead of checking out the next morning as usual! She was in her underwear & putting on her makeup in pleasure in front of the mirror when the alarm sounded!

We had to prove we had reserved (and paid in advance) for that one room. When asked what we should do with the occupants they wanted to kick out, they didn't care. It was just, ""We've re-keyed that room so you no longer have access to it and we're about to move your property out of there."" Turns out someone on the hotel staff had keyed in the wrong check-out date. Why create all that stress?  They also wanted to know why we had put the same occupant name on every room? But when we checked in, there were separate names on the key envelopes and on the television welcome screens in each room. So once again, someone in the office had somehow made those changes after we checked in — but blamed us.  The office staff's attitude was, ""We couldn't possibly make any mistakes, so we'll aggravate the customer."" But they did make mistakes — twice (that we know of).  Just be careful. Write down names and keep your paperwork.",0
58640,"Staff very pleasant and polite however its in Deptford Bridge over a mile from Greenwich so we spent most of a weekend travelling by tube/light railway travelling by rail into Greenwich. In addition limited parking, rooms very small and a bar with no atmosphere. When i complained about room size i was ignored. However the space was very very limited.",0
58651,Disappointing is all I can say   On arrival I had paid for parking and although there is a buzzer system to allow the gates to be opened I had to go into the hotel and ask for these to be opened as nobody monitors opening the gates (same issue when leaving)  The reception was understaffed and super slow.  Had to ask for staff to be sent to the bar so people could purchase a drink.  The room was tiny ….    The room I had was right next to either a kitchen or a storage facility within the hotel with staff banging and moving objects making so much noise in the middle of the night 1am/2am that it was almost impossible to sleep.  This hotel is also not anywhere near the O2 there if your looking for a location to stay for that venue I would pick somewhere else.  👎👎 out of 5 …… very underwhelming,0
58755,"We Just wanted to relax some time away from work so we had a night stay. Apparently none of the tv app was working to watch some movies. Later found out there was a Samsung tv issue through one of the receptionist her name was Pauline , who was very unhelpful, not wanting to listen and gave up on trying any further. This was our 6th stay in there and first time we’ve had a very bad experience also there was no amenities available. According to the price we paid for the service we got was very poor. Not booking again. Terrible experience.",0
58796,"I didn't enjoy it at all , the hotel food wasn't nice, the hotel drainage wasn't in order so smelt terrible in the bedroom . Entertainment was rubbish if any and one man serving at each bar so you was lucky if you got a few drinks per night as you could only get one drink per person on getting served , so sorry not for me. And if you go out of the hotel be careful because the people that live there pester you like crazy and believe me I've been to many places and this is one place I would never return too .",0
58803,"We stopped over at this hotel for one short night, we arrived late and left early.  I had expensive food items with me that needed a fridge, my booking clearly stated that a mini bar would be in the room.  When I complained about this, I wasn't even given a response! The woman behaved like a computer and wouldn't give me any explanation.  She claimed that no manager would be around for 30mins, after I had paid full price and put my PIN number in, which is enough everywhere in the world! I was prevented from leaving the grounds by a so called manager! since they wanted me to come back and sign the receipt.  We were late for a flight, and just about caught it. From our short stay, the decor and breakfast was not deserving of 4 stars, and the customer service was zero.  If you need a clean, quick one night stop over like we did, it was passable but I wouldn't book a holiday here. They need a lesson in understanding a customers needs.",0

Unpleasant staff - apart from entertainment team - not eager to help and serve ... Try to search for something to eat between 5.30pm and 7pm...  What does all inclusive mean there ?

Since it is ramadan the breakfast meal has been trasferred to s7oor which means the same food or at the same rate should be delieveres we literally had almost nothing to eat!!they treat the arabs very badly.

Very quiet and located only 1 minute from Barberini metro station. Staff are somewhat rude, but they can accommodate some time. To get into the hotel, you need to walk by the restaurant, look on your left and you will see 2 green doors and a ring. Ring the bell and they will let you in, then after you can use your room card.",0
58910,"I stayed here for 2 nights as a part of a school trip.  My stay here was more so a negative experience because of what the people around me were saying - that the room looked like it was from the movie 'The Exorcism' and that during the night they had a HELP button glowing red. The bathroom light also turned off by itself when I was looking in the mirror, which totally freaked me out.  Besides those aspects, our room only had 2 beds and there were three of us, so I had to sleep on a fold up bed with a rock hard mattress that was incredibly uncomfortable. The wifi was really dodgy so we had to sit around in the reception room to check our social media. Our windows also backed onto a large courtyard, so if someone else had their window open and was talking loudly it would echo.   However, the hotel was conveniently located as it was only a short walk to the train/subway station, and there was a gelato store near the entrance of the building - which was a plus.",0
59179,"The design of the hotel are very stylish but service unfortunately is terrible what is absolutely unacceptable for 5star boutique hotel.  Im always book design hotels made by locals in my travels, but this time was very disappointed.   Staff on reception charge the amount of my booking two times what is absolutely non-professional. At the last evening my card was not working and I come to reception to change it, but reception manager make a scandal for 30 minutes (it was late, 23:30), tell me that -  I make her upset (in 5star hotel I heard it!!!).   Then I ask to settle the bill and during almost 20 min wait for bill to pay for extras (31EUR), because my flight was early and I was afraid that in the morning they will be slow and could not provide fast check out. And she again make scandal during 20 minutes, talk incorrect and upset. She tell me that I forgot to give deposit for 200EUR and they have only 100EUR deposit from from me and it makes troubles to her, but my bill for extras was only 31EUR and I come to settled it. In a normal hotel if they have a question to guests they meet guests after breakfast or call or write e-mails, but here - they meet you with scandal. Noisy and terrible service.   Absolutely terrible service at the reception.",0
59229,"I wish I had not stayed here for four nights. It was miserable for so many reasons. The trains next to the building are extremely loud and run all day and info the night. They stop from 1am-5am.  On the weekend you can hear the thumping music from the bar downstairs unitl 1-2am. The whole place was dingy, and filthy compared to ANY other hostel I have stayed in. The place is in a very dodgy part of the city and although there was a code operated door to get in, strangers were trying to break in using another code. They no longer provide breakfast and only one staff on site ( who was very kind and helpful). there is a very small kitchen and absolutely no common area to sit and talk to other travelers. The bed wasn't bad but the decor and rugs were very worn and beer soaked. In the room and bathrooms there is no where to put your things. No hooks or shelves and you have to put stuff on the floor or hold it. It seems as though they have left this place to fall apart as a hostel and keep the bar going downstairs. I would not recommend this place no matter the price, as there are plenty of other nice hostels in London.",0
59307,"I'm not going to say this place was ""dirty"" but it was definitely dingey and old. If you want to stay somewhere where you're guaranteed almost no sleep then this is the place for you! The train tracks are right next to the building and that thing seemed to run 24 hours a day. If you're there on a weekend, be prepared to hear the party goers roaming the streets (since apparently the windows and/or walls are paper thin) and also be prepared to deal with the drunken, obnoxiously loud people who are up all night purposely bothering people who are trying to sleep. I had to be up at 6am for my flight the next day and didn't sleep at all because of the noise level of other guests. The management also didn't seem to care much considering they 1.) did nothing to stop it and 2.) when I emailed about it they said ""that is very unfortunate."" Real sincere. Also, a rented a converter from them in order to charge my laptop and camera while I was there. There was a deposit given to rent one and when you return it they give you the deposit back. HOWEVER, they fail to tell you that if you have an early flight the next day and there is no one there at the hostel to give it to, they don't give you your money back. I sent an email saying exactly where I left it because I had to catch a flight and there was no one working, and they emailed me back and said to receive my deposit I would have had to given it to someone and that I should have handed it in the night before. How is that possible if there was no one there?! Also needed to charge my devices overnight before an 8 hour flight home. Absolutely ridiculous and BEYOND disappointed in my stay here. I will never be returning here again! ",0
59563,"Stayed 6 nights in 2 weeks at this hotel with various bad experiences. 1st I stayed on 26-28 oct They upgraded my room to a suite room which it great, but when we arrived the AC room wasn't cold enough so I complained, they try to fix it but still the aircon not running well. then they didn't provide complementary until the last day even though I had made a request for it. Restaurant service in the morning tends to be slow and the availability of food is slow to restock. 2nd time i stayed from 2-6 nov This one is worse than the first. The first day the air conditioner had problems until I sweated when I took a nap, the repairman tended to be unfriendly . Slippers in the room were not available so I had to ask, they forgot to give a welcome drink voucher and again I had to ask for complementary after many time of calling they responded in the end. The second day the room was not cleaned properly, empty drinking bottles were still lying around and the table was not cleaned, the bathroom amenities were not restocked so I had to ask for soap and shampoo to take a shower. Day 3 because I have to work in the morning I asked for breakfast pax to be take away I asked at 7.45 am  directly to the restaurant with a menu of omelette, sausage and pancakes then I went back to my room and took shower, when I came back at 8.15 they had not done anything and asked me to wait I ask to talk to the manager who on duty to make a complaint but he appear then because of limited time I decided to go to work. On the 4th day I went to resto at 6.45 in the morning Again asking for breakfast pax to take away I asked if there is the manager already come, the officer said he had not arrived yet, and will around 7 and this time I asked the manager to take the breafast to my room so i can talk and complain to him since he always not appear everytime i looking for him, he to the breakfast pax to my room at 7.45  he said  their slow service was normal considering it was quite a busy breakfast time, i said i can understand but do really need more than 30 minutes for omelette, sausage and pancakes, and he keep make an excuse, so i decide to cut the conversation since i had to go at 8 am. It was very disappointing for me. The way they serve is even worse than 3 star hotel",0

The water pump made a horrendous sound, neither coffee pot work and  no hot water after one shower. I had to take a cold shower and was not happy. The owner notified Booking.com that we did not check in which was not true. By doing that I could not review them on Booking.com. How clever but I can do it here. Talked with the owner and agreed to pay one night and he charged us for both. He said he didn't care if we gave him a bad review. So much for customer service.",0
60524,"We stayed there October 9th and had to pay $250 because it was a Saturday.  You walk in and it kind of looks like they're out of business - there's this sort of bleakness about the lobby. Our room was grubby.  Everywhere you looked there were smears of dirt: the light switches, the laminated thing with TV channels. the remote, the lamps, you name it.  One of the covers on my sister's bed had some kind of gross stain on it.  The carpet and furniture were probably chosen to camoflauge dirt - we did not dare sit on the couch or leave our luggage on the carpet.  Our TV didn't work, our shower didn't work, the A/C was loud. Oh, and they don't have secure internet. Oh, and they say they have a restaurant, but they don't.  We requested a partial or full refund, but they refused, saying that we should have called the one person at the front desk and asked for a new room.  WHY? Was our room somehow the outlier in terms of one-star status?  I suppose all the others are 4-star, as they falsely claim their hotel is?  Run, don't walk, away from this hotel.  And where are all these 5-star reviews coming from?  Trust me, this hotel doesn't even deserve one star.",0

60547,"The service left a lot to be desired. Waited between 15 and 20 minutes for someone at the front desk.  After checking in we check the room for toiletries. My wife has a severe allergy to nuts, some of the products in the restroom dd not have label. We asked the front desk if the toiletries were nut safe, he responded saying he did not know. Made no effort to find out until I continued to request. He asked 1 staff member walking by the front area, they couldn't come up with an answer.  We also have allergies to Goose Down so we asked what material the bedding is made from. When asked clerk responded ""You are asking a lot of questions I do not know the answer to"". With no answer to this I ask if we can just get regular cotton pillows, a short ""no"" was the response. Clerk then said ""If it seems like I am not all here or am not listening to you, it's because I'm not"".  With allergies severe enough that a customer may be hospitalized or even die, the staff at the South Loop made little effort to provide answers to the question, let alone take corrective action.  It's hard to appreciate things like ""a spacious room"" or ""Free parking"" when thinking back on my experience at the South Loop. Staying at 3 other hotels in Illinois within the same week, respectful and professional staff was able to answer all of the above questions  in just a few seconds and provide alternative options quickly.

They charged my card a extra $309 for a cancellation fee.

We had a budget on our trip and they caused around $500 in pending charges/refunds for what was supposed to be $146 charge for one night.

I ended up paying full price for the reservation I paid in full for in points and pay points plus cash for an addition room.

61313,"On a recent staycation and using the package deal which includes the $88 F & B credits, we partook our meals at the Eatery.   The Eatery provides a Mookata deal of $48 nett price for a 2-pax platter and they also have an ala-carte Mookata buffet. Upon checking the price for the ala-carte Mookata deal, we were told it was $55 for 2 pax. We thought it was a very good deal but maybe a tad unbelievable, given the price. So, we checked again with another wait staff and he wrote it down on a piece of paper which alluded to $55 for 2 pax.   We still could not believe such a great deal and thinking that there could be some miscommunication along the way, we checked (FOR THE 3rd TIME) with another staff who promptly told us that it was actually $55 for ONE pax.  How could it have gone so wrong, when the price for the ala-carte Mookata was queried 3 times! Could not Eatery have printed it out to save all the hassles?  The next morning, we went to the Eatery for our breakfast and requested a window seat. It was turned down by the wait staff, saying it was ""Reserved"". However, within 5 minutes later, we saw them promptly seated the other 2 guests on the window seat. We checked and found that the guests did not make any reservations, but had chosen to sit closer to their other friends to respect the 8 pax social distancing requirement. The 2 guests did not reserve the window seat. But still, since it was ""Reserved"", shouldn't the wait staff respect that? Then why bother placing the ""Reserved"" sign?  The wait staff then challenged us to ""complain"" to the Manager, saying ""I don't want to argue with you"". Should those words even be uttered by service staff in the first place?

61452,"It was my first time staying in this hotel in Nov 2018. Initially we were attracted by this hotel given it was a chain hotel and newly opened in 2018, yet after the experience we had with our stay in this hotel, we definitely had changed our mind. This was quite normal to put personal care items including facial cleanser, toothbrush kit etc (which were all our newly opened ones) in the washroom as we didnt prefer to use hotel supplied ones. After the first day hotel room cleaning service, unfortunately we could not find back all our personal belongings which were initially placed in the washroom. It was a very inconvenient experience to us that we lost the personal care items on first day of travel given shops all closed when we realised we lost them and couldnt enjoy our stay in this hotel. On same day night, we reflected our concern to the hotel staff to investigate the issue we lost our personal belongings in the washroom. However, not all staff could understand English well and it seemed that they were quite green in handling guests enquires/ resolving guest problems. After several days of our follow up with the hotel staff, the hotel manager just reverted a comment that the cleaning staff would not throw away personal belongings of the guests and they showed no sincerity in following up our issue any more. After this experience, we had to keep the washroom empty with our things everyday to avoid losing our personal things anymore. Hence better take our experience as a reference when choosing this hotel. We would not choose this hotel chain anymore in the future after this unhappy experience.",0

61902,"Sadly a very disappointing experience. We were using the hotel to link on an overnight with old friends visiting from USA. One of them has some health issues so the plan was to remain in the hotel for meals. The menu was basic bar food as the same menu covered the bar, room service and a dining area which was a windowless offshoot of the bar. In the event to avoid difficulty for our companion we attempted to order food but three of our choices were unavailable! The hotel blurb offered a dining experience and a special offer of 50 for40 if paid in advance. We had done this but obviously cancelled. We eventually went out to a neighbouring restaurant. It is unacceptable for a hotel of this magnitude not to offer an evening meal of any acceptable standard .  On our return we attempted to have a nightcap. No port, no sherry, no single malt scotch..., and the only coffee offered was a sachet as available in the rooms!

62122,"This place is under a underpass dimly lit and the sheets, pillow cases  were stained and hair all over the bed.They were poor quality also .I tried to get a refund and Booking .Com and the established refused if you are staying in Bangkok there are many other hotels much better.Do not make the mistake of staying here. I offered to stay one night in good faith the refund me my remaining days and they refused and booking. Com did not refund me not the establishment. ",0
62138,Place could have been a better. No Indian restaurant is close by.  House keeping department needs improvement. We were three members in one room i.e. Two Adults and one child but every thing was given assuming two people despite of request. Lesser than expected rating,0
62142,The photos do not conform to reality.  The cleanliness leaves something to be desired.  The decoration leaves something to be desired.  The hotel is located near a bridge where you do not feel safe coming back late at night.,0
62146,"Hotel looks old not like in the website, no local food are nearby. Sevel or BTS station also far away and go to DMK airport takes around 1 hours. We will definetely not recommed this hotel to any of our friends, coleague or others people who read this review",0
62147,"The room itself was a standard sized room not thing to complain about there, but the room had mold and water damage in the floor and the walls. the bathroom had mold, so when i went to pick up something from my car and returned to the room you could smell the mold and how bad the air quality were in there after only one night of sleeping, the TV in the room had some thing wrong with the picture. the room did not seem to be washed before we checked in, there were a lot of dirt and dust on almost every surface of the room, our feet were so dirty after walking on the floor in the room, bathroom had black spots of mold in it and did not smell or feel good at all. when this was brought to the attention of the reception staff they changed the tv in the room and did not do much else. we later spoke with the night shift at the reception and she gave us another room, sadly this room also had the same problems as the first one except the TV was working normally. it is advertised that the hotell had won a excellency prize with trip advisor, etc. this do not feel like an hotell worthy of any prizes sadly and it desperately needs to improve their rooms. they had 3 different sized rooms available at the time of my booking and i yet got a standard room even tho i payed for the upgrade, witch was disappointing and it does not feel like a 3-star Hotell.",0
62149,The hotel looks NOTHING like the pictures and neither do the rooms ! They literally look nothing like what is pictured !   Cons- The hotel is situated near / under a bridge  It feels very unsafe - especially if you are a few girls travelling alone  It’s is very far from the center and any night life  It’s quite a distance from the BTS about 20 - 30 min walk  Some rooms have no windows ( without mentioning this on the booking ) Beds felt unclean  Toilet seat had hair on it ( generally didn’t feel clean)  No hairdryer as stated on the room discription   Pros’ Sort of cheap   Honestly save your money and go somewhere that’s a bit more decent and feels like it is situated in a safe neighbourhood.  We felt very threatened walking to and from the station after dark,0
62204,Got booked into a room that had a broken air conditioning and ended up leaking all over my cloth.  They ended us making us pack our cloth and moving us to a room with two twin beds that had a broken safe box.  They tried fixing it but was unable and just left us in there.  Had to pack up again and move to a new room. They gave us no accommodation for the inconvenience they caused us and the stay was just horrible.,0
62314,"We booked one room for a four night stay for my parents and one room for a two night stay for my partner and I. A week or so before our stay my father was informed that there had to be maintenance work done in a few rooms and that they would have to move my parents into a different hotel. After informing them that this would be inconvenient as we had another room at the hotel they asked if they could move us as well.  We checked out the other hotel and said it would be find but asked for a compensation as the hotel that they wanted to move us to was 30 Euros a night cheaper than the hotel we originally booked.  They ended up moving us to the other hotel but informed us that we had already paid for our stay and wouldn't be reimbursed at all (please remember this was a two night stay and a four night stay at a 30 € difference a night leading up to a difference of 180 € !).   Then they let us know that we could cancel the booking with the original hotel we booked but we wouldn't be able to get the payment back that we already made (which was the full amount for the stay). So that didn't make any sense either. We didn't get an apology or any reimbursement at all!   So please do not book this hotel, it was a bad experience, a terrible start for our vacation and led to a lot of confusion and annoyance before we even got there.

62427,The smell of urine and visible molds in the the bathroom are disgusting.  Cigarette butts in the balcony.  Stains on the carpet.. room is dusting.  We asked to change the room but they couldn’t accommodate but offer to send the cleaning crew.  Horrendous experience,0
62516,I stayed here in the best room available. What a shame the photos and description were not representative of the shabby room with a bed and headboard that had a smell of unwashed hair.the window would not close the paint was peeling the carpet dirty and stained. Throughout the entrance was an overwhelming smell of old cooking oil.I had traveled along way expecting more than a low rent experience what a disappointment.,0
62517,"The reservation in this hotel Is not guarantee even tought you made the paiement. The Manager use to refund Money whitout saying anything j Just telling  you have to look for a new accomodation. This happened ti me on decembre 23rd. I didn't feel well because a surgery I recently had. So what a real problem for me find a new hotel. They don't likes Italian people and they are raciste. They pur me on the road  La prenotazione in questo albergo non ha valore anche se già pagata. La Manager usa rimborsare il pagamento senza dare preavviso ma solamente dicendo che dovete cercarvi un'altra sistemazione.  A me è successo il 23 Dicembre: non mi sentivo  bene, sono stata recentissimamente operata ed è stato difficilissimo trovare una nuova sistemazione. Mi hanno praticamente messo in mezzo ad una strada",0

62696,"On May 17, 1919, our partners from the United States were forced to meet with representatives of the Ukrainian side in the parking lot, in the car, and not in the hotel lobby or restaurant, because the hotel's security did not let me (I am an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine) into the hotel, only because I was dressed in the uniform of the country I am fighting for. By the way, the representative of the Comissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rehabilitation of Combatants was also a participant of the delegation.  Instead of apologizing the guard told us there is a wartime posture in the country, that`s why a man in a military form can scare customers.   Instead to give me the book for complaints and hotel rules according to my requirements, I received a polite refusal and a proposal to visit the spa salon of the hotel, what I personally have perceived as humiliation.  I would like to say to the administration of the Hayat hotel: go down to Earth, there is no wartime posture in the country now! Wearing military uniform is a part of our officer's life!  And I'm sorry for you if you consider it is normal to humiliate an officer, and then, as a compensation, to offer a pedicure in your spa salon.  You have understood nothing about us!  I regret that our partners have chosen to stay in this hotel.",0
62705,"The Hyatt offers a good standard for business hotel. However, service quality is sometimes low. In general, the service is provided quite mechanical and without any sense for passion and friendliness. During my last stay a tea in the lobby restaurant was serviced after 20 minutes. Complaints were answered with rolling eyes. Overall the Hyatt is a good hotel with many amenities, but not worth the price and not showing what a guest expects from a 5-star hotel.",0
62789,Horror!!! I just walked in to start my 7 day quarantine and I am feeling dreadful: the room is smelly and very very run down. cabinet missing a door and all the messy wires cables exposed. Bathroom is old and towels are dirty. Simply unbelievable this is Holiday Inn. If there’s is a choice I would not rate it any star. This is my first night and dinner was not delivered. So I’m already ordering delivery. This hotel needs a renovation urgently. The WiFi router in the room in this day and age is a joke. I can’t believe this room is costing USD300 a day! I would not suggest this place for anyone. It’s a nightmare to think about my next 7 days in this room. Really regretting I booked this place.,0
62790,"I would HIGHLY advise you avoid this hotel! We booked for 1 week quarantine in April 2022 and upon arriving in the room, it was immediately obvious how dirty the room was! There are clumps of dust balls gathered around the base of the beds and on the tables was very dusty. When I switched on the aircon, within minutes, my iPad screen was covered in dust proving how dirty and dusty the room was.  When I asked the hotel for a vacuum cleaner they said ""Cannot"" and offered a pan and brush which is pointless in this instance. When paying over US$1600 for a week quarantine, I most certainly dont expect to have to clean my own room right as I have arrived! Dont even get me started on the food. The hotel feels quarantine is an opportunity to cash in on the rooms that are being charged at an astronomical rate for what you get and give the most pathetically cooked meals that would be sent back to a kitchen in an regular restaurant.   To be clear, I am not someone who expects a penthouse suite and I am happy to ""slum"" it if I have to, but when paying this amount for a week, i certainly expect my room to be clean at the very least!",0

62802,Hotel is extremely disorganised. 1.5 hour waiting in line just to get in. Will not be coming back.   At least 50 people in line and only 2 desks working. They say check in time is 3pm but we did not get into room until at least 5pm.  This is really a horrible customer service.,0
62811,"We had two nights as part of a tour and paid for a two night extension so I know this is not a budget hotel.  The more you pay the greater expections.  This hotel is in a convenient location for bars, eateries and transport.  It is spacious and we had a large room.  The first disappointment was to find that another £28 a day was needed to have a swim.  Although large our room had a tired settee and we had numerous issues with room service.  Only large bath towels for our last night, no face cloths, no t-bags after 1st day, bath mats as hand towels and miniscule toiletries.  The last straw was when somebody entered our room on the last morning without knocking and my wife was naked.  We raised all these points with the hotel before leaving",0
62832,"COMPLAINT I raised regarding the misuse of my Banking Card. I booked City Sightseeing Tour tickers via the hotel reception. An error occurred and the member of staff attempted to debit my account twice. This resulted in my UK Bank applying a Red Flag Warning on my accounts as they believed the transactions to be fraudulent. This had a massive impact on my available finances during my stay.  The reason for my negative comment is because of the way the Hotel dealt with this complaint, continually blaming City Sightseeing Tour website when I was in Budapest and subsequently upon returning to the UK when I emailed them to confirm what my Bank advised, they just will not accept that it was actually the result of their member of staffs error. It was just an apology I was after, nothing else. Shame on them , this is not the attire you expect from a 5* Hotel.  DONT USE YOUR CARD IN THIS HOTEL!!!!!",0
63011,"We ordered a double bedroom. The bed was a doubter model, there was just 1 chair in the room, the matrass rested on a wooden board, and a worn out table. Room was not cleaned daily nor coffee or tea refilled.

I couldn't get my UK visa in time, and therefore I asked them for cancelling my reservation (They sent me the cancellation email). After some days I realize that they charged me the whole price (they should have charged only booking fee). I sent them an email and they didn't respond.

63217,"I made reservation through booking.com requested for smooking room and anniversary set up, upon check in reception said they made the anniversary setup in non smoking room. And reception told me they can give smoking room and move the set up. When we arrived in the room surprisingly there is no set up at all which is very disappointing. And also the room is very cold took so long for someone to come to assist us adjusting the temperature. We went to restaurant to have dinner but before we left the room we kept some items in the minibar fridge however when we came back its not cold at all. In the middle of the night while we were watching a netflix the tv in all of sudden got blurred and error we had to call and waited for half an hour till someone fix it.  We were informed by reception to have a late check-out at 6pm, however around 3pm somebody just knock the door and directly open the door without even waiting for our answer. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  Upon checking out, nobody approached us to ask about our experience at paramount hotel. Everybody was just ignoring us.   Very bad experience for 5 star hotel.",0
63239,"Arrived at DAMAC Royale on 31st October. Waited over a half hour to be checked in. The roses for guests are a nice touch but didn't excuse the long wait.   Hotel was busy so it was difficult to get the lift to stop at our floor to get down to the lobby.  Set down area is a disgrace. Nobody seems to know what is going on. This results in long tail backs to get to the hotel set down area.   As for the restaurant, we were the only people in it (3 guests) with about 10 waiting staff hanging around. Food took at least 40 minutes even though we were the only ones there! Asked for extra tartar sauce - never got it. Had to ask for the bill twice.   Nice decor, spacious suites. More attention needed when cleaning the toilet area of the master suite - behind the door was quite dirty.   Will not be returning. ",0
63240,I have expressed my concearns regarding the service (or lack of) in writing to the hotel and would not recommend anyone to stay there. I never take the time to fill out forms or make complaints but in this case I thought I would make an exeption.,0
63243,I  booked 3 room apartment on damac royal towers and have been staying there since 23 October  until 31 October. It   I am very dissatisfied there have been a few different incidents that has made me and my family not happy with our stay at damac royal towors. It started with the guys cleaning the windows when they hang on ropes we sit in the pool and sunbathing so suddenly the dirty water on our face from the guys who clean the windows I chose to didn't bother and moved on us instead. when we went up at home we realized that the balcony was full of dirty water also from the guys hanging on ropes and cleaning the windows our clothes that hung on the chairs to dry were filled with dirt I also had new white shoes that got dirty and could not be cleaned because the water which drain down is brown on dirty our clothes that hung to dry were destroyed. I go down to the lobby to speak to a maneger (Tamer)he  apologize and say that they will send someone to clean the balcony. When I ask what to do with my shoes and clothes that is ruined.He says he can not do much about it.When I wonder why they have not announced that they should do such a job he just says he apologizes time and again without even offering dry cleaning. No one came and cleaned the balcony  Floor filled with dirt.Then it happened another thing  I went down to the pool with my family and ordered 2 cups of coffee for me and my wife because the coffee in the suite was just caffeine free..after 2 hours and after 3 calls we still got no coffee I chose to go and talk to the manager and he apologized and said he would compensate me I clearly said that I did not want something without wanting to just drink my first cup of coffee for the day. The manager (Tamer) said that he would fix  it  and that I could wait in the room. When it rings at the Door it is an employee with a plate of 2 apples and 2 oranges But NO COFFEE I felt so humiliated.and angry they dont take pepole serious Only IF its a young good looking girl ,0

63267,"I guess it is joke when you see these 4 towers but not giving the minimum service. I am loyal customer of Damac for years. I know all of them. This hotel doesn't deserve 5 stars. I had to call 2 times to get a comb, toothbrush, and shaving kit. They didn't renew the towels in the bathroom. I don't pay high price to bad service. Very bad experience,  don't recommend till they change the HK Manager. I did talk to Mr Peter Salim the manager,  I really don't know if actions will be taken as I don't have any feedback. Regards",0
63274,"They are making fool of people by giving wrong name of the property. We booked in Damac Paramount but stayed in Damac Royale. The apartments are not very clean. You can see marks everywhere. Bathrooms are not upto the mark. Towels were dirty. There is nothing near by, one has to take taxi to go anywhere. Over smart staff which was irritating. Never going there again.",0
63381,"We arrived very early - way before you can expect to get your room - so we just asked if we could leave our bags, and then go enjoy the City. We also asked when can we expect to be able to check in (Official check in is 15.00). We were told - ""You can expect your room to be ready any time between 1200 and 1400"". All good - we left our bags, wen out from brunch and lunch.  At 1400 we were back at hotel - asked if it were possible to check in. The answer were (from the same guy as in the morning) - no sorry not possible yet, but  house keeping is gonna clean your room now, and in 45 min it is ready - so at 1445.  Ah ok - I told him we will wait in the lounge area, and please let us know when ready.  At 1445 I went back to the guy to ask it it would be possible to check in. His answer were ""Sorry - but check in dont start before 15.00!"" While we have waited I have seen many others getting their room - and we should only stay 1 night, and have just booked a standard room - so I was just saying ""just give us any room that is ready"".  His answer were ""You have booked as a Gold member from Hotels.com - this will give you and upgrade and a bottle of wine in the room - so it must be the upgraded room we have assigned for you - so please come back at 15.00 when check in starts"".  Ok - so the upgrade and the bottle of Wine is no essential for us not to be able to check in early, because it needs to be that specific room they have planned for us.  At 15.00 the guy left work, and I went to reception to check in - now with a new guy. Even now, room were not ready - even it is the official check in time. I were asked to wait 5 min - the housekeeping supervisor were just missing to check the room now.  At 15.20 we have still not got our room, and  I went back to reception. Now he called housekeeping again - nad yes, now the room that we have waited 1½ hour to get were ready, you remember the special room for us, with the upgrade, and the bottle of wine.  So we went to our room at 15.30 - just to find a total standard room - NO upgrade, No bottle of wine - just a total standard room - so we have now waited 1 hour for a room, with the excuse that we would get upgrade and wine - but there were NOTHING.  I went to reception - and they were so sorry ""Oh sorry, are there anything we can do - we will do anything for you"". My answer were, ""no - you cant take back the crap you told me, and the 1½ hour we waited for nothing"".  Went back to room, unpacked a little, and to take a nap - placed the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign on door, we needed to rest before going out for dinner a few hours later.  1550 - reception called, now they had a suite ready for us - 2 hours after they told us how important it were we got that room that were assigned to us - and 1 hour after official check in time - now the room were ready - after we had unpacked and went to nap. We rejected the upgrade, we just wanted to relax.  At 16.00 - a waiter came to the room - not respecting the ""Do not DISTURB"" sign - and kept knocking on the door - to give us this 1 bottle of famous wine that were so important that we could not get another room 2 hours ago. A crappy 6 Euro wine - that we just left in the room next day when leaving.  Next day, when doing check out the reception asked ""Did you have a good stay"" And my answer were clearly - NO - and never coming back to this hotel.  The reception staff really just play with you, and tell you whatever they want, and you cant trust it.  I am never gonna stay there - and will seriously consider to cancel my 15 nights that I have booked in another Warwick hotel later this year.",0
63400,On arrival we were told there was a 50euro deposit for eaxh night that was not disclosed during booking.  Paid the deposit despite feeling very uncomfortable about the transaction but id just spent the day travelling and there was a queue behind me.  At check out i specifically asked for confirmation the deposit had been released and was told it was done automatically.   A week later the money was not in my account. They told me there was an issue with the system and that it hadnt actually been released but was noq released. A week later still not in my account and they are not responding to messages. I get automated emails in French from the payment service provider telling the query has been cancelled and to contact my bank.   I am not doing additional work to get my money and expect the hotel to do everything to ensure the refund is complete and apologise.,0
63421,"We chose this hotel based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, big mistake! The room was cheap but far from good value. The walls are so thin you can hear your neighbours talking and I was woken up throughout the night by all sorts of noises. The noise was unbearable how when we spoke to the staff they said we had one of the ‘most quiet rooms’.  The towels were also old, worn and had holes in them. Overall we were not impressed. Would not recommend this hotel. ",0

I had to call the electrician to come up to help me change them, but he was stepping all over my bed and when he tried to fix the light there was dust coming down from the ceiling.

They did but I would have expected at list a complimentary fruits or so...

63794,"Before I visited Nanjing, I searched hotels around that area. Sofitel jumped out to my eye, good reviews and nice location. But after I booked this hotel, the nightmare just began. 1. Using third party to redeem the points, they couldn't find your reservation. if you came from foreign, I persuade you never choose this method to book this one. Otherwise, you won't find your info in their system. They always have excuses to find you. Then you need call international call to your third party at China. Remember your time zone, how inconvenient you will suffer. 2. If you can stand the bathroom odd smell, then pick this one. Nothing we can say. 3. Even you choose non-smoking rooms, you still feel free to smell smoking. 4. After we checked out, back to US. Later one, your credit card was charged by no reason. Remember you using your points to pay the hotel long time ago. Anyway, won't choose this one anymore.",0
63805,"Tried to find some certainty in the brand but failed…First night the thermostat inside the room had no effect on the temperature (it seems there is some central heating system in place - then why bother installing room thermostats?). Anyhow, the staff moved us to a different room with more appropriate temperature but here the shower drain was plugged. Maybe I'm too picky if I request some decent temperature and a proper shower in a 5 star hotel…Overall the hotel is dated with rooms and bathrooms especially screaming for major renovations if they want to claim any luxury standard. On the positive note, the breakfast reminded of some Sofitel glory. And of course they forgot about the Accor Club points…",0
63887,"We have chosen DS because of good reviews but we had a terrible experience. When we got to the hotel we did not found any information on how to call someone to open the door. After waiting for a while we had no choice but make a phone call. Why not having an arrow at the door bell to call someone to open the door? After taking a shower to go out with to have dinner but when just at the corner we started feeling the effects at tear gas. I felt it first in the eyes and my daughter soon in her throat. We moved to other direction and walked away. However, when we came back the situation was worst. As police moved people from Taskim Square the use to protest at the surround and the hotel is only 15 min from it. The hotel street was full of people and tear gas was everywhere. We tried to run but I hit my leg on a street mini post. We were together with the receptionist but it was terrible to find the hotel door. Once in the room we thought our problems were solved. It took a while to feel better after feeling the gas. But suddenly we felt the gas inside the room. I decided to open the door room by more gas came from the stairs. Then I called the reception twice but no one answered. We had no choice at the time (going out and run could be worst) so we tried to put wet towels at the door gap to avoid more gas to come in. After that I decided to call Deniz and describe the situation to her. She asked the young man to come around and he finally opened the terrace door so the air could circulate from the stairs. We spent the night listening to people running and shouting and hearing the bombs. When I remember that I sent to e-mails to Deniz asking if the situation was safe and I had mentioned the tear gas weeks before she told me not to worry. I finally decided to leave the hotel and look for another one but she said ""if you leave it is your problem"". I asked for any money compensation, at the least for the next three days that I would pay for other hotel but the answer was ""no"". I explain that I well travelling with a 16 old girl and I was divorced I could not stay there anymore and leave the hotel after breakfast. I am not saying the hotel is not good (breakfast was nice) but I think  we could have better support during that awful night and not listen from her that ""tear gas is good for the skin"" and that ""other guest did not complain"" (a couple left early in the morning and we say saw only a group of for the next day). What I am saying is that we deserve more transparency when asked about any unsafe situation and  comprehension and respect when problems happens. Unlucky only?! PS. We moved to Sultahmet hotel district and it was so peaceful.",0
63976,"We booked this hotel with a link from TripAdvisor to Expedia.  Our friends also booked this on Hotels.com.  Our room was disgusting.  There was peeling and chipped paint, frayed and filthy rugs, couldn't regulate air even when someone came to service.  Our friend's room was beautiful with a balcony.  When we tried to call front desk - no connection.  Called from  cell  and was told all the rooms are different as they are individually owned! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL -",0
63980,"Lack of equipment in the kitchen, just two plates, two spoons, two knives, two forks, two mugs and two small glasses, not even a wine glass or corkscrew. Nothing to prepare food with, no pans, cooking bowls or even breakfast bowls. Why bother providing two hot plates? No plug in the sink so we had to wash up in the bathroom. One single dining seat which was broken, for a room that accommodates two, the toilet seat was also broken. BUT THE WORST THING AND MOST DISTURBING THING WAS WATER COMING THOUGH THE CEILING VIA A SPOTLIGHT, (VERY DANGEROUS)  INTO THE BATHROON AND KITCHEN UNITS.  THE WATER ISSUE WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ONGING PROBLEM AS THERE WERE BROWN WATER MARKS ALL AROUND THE LIGHT FITTING. THE ROOM SHOULD NEVER OF BEEN LET OUT TO GUESTS IN THAT STATE. WE WERE EVENTUALLY MOVED, ( ON DAY 3) BUT NO APPOLOGY FROM THE FRONT DESK STAFF.  Customer service was so very poor to the point of being rude. All of these issues should of been picked up by the housekeeping manager, who should check the rooms before any guest arrives. The second room wasn't much better, furniture a bit tatty, it did have a balcony but we were a little hesitant to go on it. The kitchen was just a poor as the one in our previous room, but it did have the luxury of a plastic spatula, not sure what that was for as it was impossible to actually prepare any food in the kitchen because of lack of any actual cooking equipment.  This has been mentioned in previous reviews and management say in their reply that the issues in the kitchen will be addressed, well they haven't been in rooms 310 and 1002 The rooms are large but the two rooms we were in looked nothing like the standard of rooms on the hotel web site. This also needs addressing. No bar or restaurant, I assume because of COVID. There were notices about guests wearing masks whilst using the lifts and public areas in the hotel, this was not enforced.

Rude receptionist answered and had me on hold said she could not help, yelled at me, and HUNG UP! This is the type of trash behavior I would never expect but if you read the reviews it makes sense.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH HOTEL.",0
64056,Got stuck here for a conference. Horrible all around experience. They have a bizarre set of procedures regarding check in and check out.

64076,"We had booked and stayed at Divani Caravel in September 2021 and we had a very bad experience at the divani caravel Greece hotel. Rooms given firstly very small, no cupboard  with shelf’s to stores clothing no smart tv and nothing felt smooth as it was a very crowded hotel and very commercial with lots of conference and  flight crew members, so it was always busy hotel , loads of people in and out. Shocking what I will mention now - A theft in broad daylight at the breakfast table at 9:20am , a thief walks in and steals away my purse with money and other personal expensive belongings and walks freely while I was feeding my child some milk on the left side I had placed my purse besides me on the seat and when I looked around to grab something from my purse - the purse was no where to be found . No waiters seen an unknown person you mean entering the restaurant , ?when enquired they don’t have cameras in or outside the restaurant they apparently only have cameras at lobby entrance .. not sure now if it was actually a thief who came and took it or it could also be one of the waiters who quickly grabbed and put it under the aprons.. who knows but the purse  with my belongings gone . The restaurant manager only kept telling us go and file a complaint to the police station , we’ll we did that but was that of any use . The thief or whoever it was has escaped with my belongings . I insisted on speaking to senior authorities of the hotel since they didn’t bother to approach me and offer something , I asked to meet with GM since there was no concern from the hotel management and upon speaking to the general manager the next day ( when we are to board a plane this day) he said that they can’t control  control the traffic .  I mean how can you allow outsiders in a restaurant that is serving  breakfast , there was no one even taking down the room numbers as you enter the restaurant . He said we can’t stop anyone from entering the restaurant and taking a look or eating from the restaurant .. really that is such poor management. Security protocol is very poorly handled and thefts are major issues in Greece in metros and busses and now it’s reached to the hotels too . Divani caravel has lost its reputation when this incident has taken place in their own premises and they never took responsibility of it .. well the case of the incident that happened at Divani has been lodged with the police and so has The hotels  reputation been put down on papers. If you plan to go to Greece and stay at divani  or any hotel don’t trust their security and mind your own belongings .. or you’ll end up with the usual statement “ it’s not our responsibility towards your belongings “…well yes I understand if I leave my things and go and then someone picks it .,but this is while I was having breakfast my purse was picked from my seat while I was still there sitting looking at he other way and at the break saf table at the restaurant of the hotel . cheeky and very  confident to pick a bag in broad day light at a breakfast seating area .. very very disappointed . If they had a strict security protocol like how we have in the Uae  , this incident would have not happened .",0

Also lack of accountability since they tried to blame expedia. Do not recommend.",0
64190,"Room users nearby were extremely noisy starting from last night in corridor (public area) and I was being awaken early this morning by those people as they were opening the doors and shouting out loudly, it was terrible especially in Sunday early morning saying 7 am, I called the front desk to help and asked why hotel allowed guests to make noisy in public area instead of their own rooms. The manager returned call with ridiculous reply and asked me to change rooms (as I stay 6 nights in this messy hotel). I was shocked as I am the victim which hotel cannot take immediate and proactively approach to stop them making noise in the public corridor, the manager requested me to change room, what’s the logic behind? I told the manager, my request is simple. I want to have a pleasant environment for taking rest, is this an unreasonable request?  This hotel cannot provides you basic hotel requirements, sleep well and taking rest is not a allowed even in your room. And hotel encourage others making noise in late night and early morning in public area. This is the real case and I cannot sleep again. The noisy people only stay 2 nights while I don’t know why people will stay only 2 nights for making noise in corridor. Hotel manager concept is weird, he did not treasure long stay and punctual guest, they welcome noisy and rude guest. If you want noisy and weird hotel, this is the one you have to choose, I have many years of hotel stay experience and this hotel can rank “top 1 noisy weird hotel in the world”",0
64449,AC in room didn’t cool - bloody hot at night. Requested repair 2x. Staff continued to give excuses. Paid for a king bed or 2 single beds but room had a queen bed. No body lotion available.

64485,"We have been staying at this hotel for years. Today we arrived to check in to a twin room we booked months in advance and we were given the most ridiculous room. The guy on the desk said we had booked a twin suite but sent us to a room with a double bed and a shoe cupboard with a shower and toilet wedged into it. We went to return to the front desk to tell them they must have made a mistake but the lifts had closed down and all guests had to use the stairs. We passed a poor woman who had a seriously bad knee problem but had to schlep up several flights of stairs to get back to her room. When we went to the foyer they told us they would make up a couch in our room as they had a 100% occupancy. We declined that ridiculous offer and said we wanted a full refund. They told us we had to speak to the manager. She had her door open and was busy talking. She saw us standing at the door to see her but went on talking and ignored us. Eventually, we asked her if she could help us as there was a serious problem. She said she was too busy but she would send Justin to fix it. Justin was fantastic and gave us our money back. We immediately went to another better run hotel and will never return to this shambles again.",0
64517,"Had just checked out after a 4 night stay.   This hotel does have some positives and tick some boxes. There are many eateries in the vicinity and there is also a supermarket nearby. But the positives probably ends here.   Rooms are supposed to be of decent size room but we were allocated probably the smallest room at 806. Room 806 is probably a fraction of what other rooms in terms of size. Wifi was also mostly frustratingly slow.   In room 806, there is a gigantic blue neon sign shining into the room. It is actually the hotel sign. In room 806, the letter ‘T’ is just outside the window. When you are lying on the bed, it can also blind you temporarily if you happen to look out of the window and look into the letter ‘T’ which is just 30-40 centimeters outside the window. We had to keep the curtains drawn throughout our stay.   The hotel also has a very bizarre deposit policy. The amount of deposit is calculated per day instead of a ballpark amount. I had to put a cash deposit of  USD 300 for a 4 day stay.   The location is another big boo boo. While it is in Tsim Sha Tsui, it is very far from the nearest subway. We had to walk 468 meters to reach the subway entrance. It is also a difficult walk as the walkways en-route to the subway very crowded all the time.  I won’t recommend this as there are many choices at the same price point.",0
64657,Do not stay here. I booked through Expedia- cancelled the booking and they have still charged my cc the fulll amount. Even after Expedia advised them it was cancelled. They won’t  refund my money! Be wary. I now have to fight the charges with my proof of cancellation!!,0
64682,"I have NOT stayed at this property yet. However we are booked in for March 2018. I can say that we have asked on 2 separate writings general questions about shuttles, area, Cruise ship area etc.. and have never once received a reply. These people have not had the courtesy to even answer. I cant speak to the rooms or the property but if this is how they treat their customers we don't expect a good stay. Will advise further after our stay.",0
64873,I could not get on my flight (standby/buddy pass) so had to cancel my booking.  I am being charged extra for not showing up.... Although I emailed the minute I knew I could not make the flight (after waiting 8 hours in airport...) policy is 72 hrs for refund.  This is stupid. The hotel makes a profit on clients problem! I pay a penalty for a problem outside my control.  Needs to be changed!,0
65028,"Having stayed here on another occasion we were disappointed in the way the general upkeep seemed to be neglected, In Particular the bathroom where the toilet cistern would continue  to fill unless you jiggled with the flush controls. The toilet seat required fixing as it would swivel. The water pressure was woefully low.  The staff were asked to do something about the bathroom and we were assured the the ""handyman"" would be informed, did not happen during our two night stay. In the room the kettle had a broken on/off switch. The staff were very polite and helpful.",0
65111,"This is by far the worst experience we have ever had in a hotel.  It started bad and went to worse. We came early, fully aware that sometimes and early check-in is fine, and sometimes not. There was a snooty young man at the reception who snootily told us that the check-in is at 3pm and our room would not be ready before that. We said fine, left our bags and went sight-seeing.  When we came back at 3pm and got our room we found the following: -The room was dirty.  -There were no towels, no shampoo, no shower gel, no soap. -The hotel website said there would be a kettle in the room, and there was none. It also said there would be a free bottled water in the room, and there was none.  I went to the reception to inform them about the faults, they promised to bring the towels and some soap to the room. A bit later a guy brought us 2 OK sized towels, 1 tiny towel and 2 small packets of combined soap and shower gel.  As for the lack of the kettle and the mineral water, the guy at the reception had the cheek to say that it was due to Covid-restrictions.  They did not tell us the wifi-password either. We had to go to the reception and ask for it.  And the dirt: The room was so dirty that during our whole stay we did not dare to move in the room without our shoes on and were afraid to touch anything. There was no hot water.  Building work was taking place. Maybe that was the reason for the dirt and the lack of hot water, but it certainly is no excuse. If they cannot provide adequate and hygienic conditions for clients, they should have closed the hotel until the building works were complete.  This is one hotel that we will never come back to. We cannot recommend it to anybody.",0
65143,"Stayed at this hotel from 22/07/18 for 5 nights. When we got there temperature was 30c when booking in asked about air conditioning was told it was not working, but you have a fan in room. Over the 5 days temperature went up to 37c, it was last sleeping in a sauna. I found out the air conditioning has not been working for over 3 months. Paid extra for breakfast which was advertised as hot and cold buffet. They stopped the hot part 2 months ago, and the cold part was disgusting for the money paid. I spoke to one of the hotel directors about the above who told me Jet2 were told about air conditioning problems. He said he would send me an email about the 2 issues, still waiting.",0
65161,Visited 18-20feb. Double room. Very small aprox 8ft x 10ft. Very cramped. The real issue was the bathroom. At just under 3ft wide you could not sit on the loo normally. Only seated sideways as there was no leg room. Shower head broken. Excessive use of plastics. Plastic cups for tea and coffee. Plastic wraped soap. On the upside the bed was comfortable. Nice reception area. Nice location near Clichy. Rooms at rear of the hotel suffer from railway noise. Reasonable value for a coty centre hotel.,0
65164,"when I book the hotel, I required a quiet room. When I arrived, I found the room they allocate to me is near the railway station. So the window and bed are shaking when the train passed. I require them to change a room. They said all the quite single room has been taken. I said that I am happy to pay extra to book a quite double. However, they gave me double with door broken. And then gave me a double near lift. I asked that if possible to change. They said you either stay in a noisy double or go back to noisy single. Some of the staff is really unwilling to help.  Also, thy promise have free adaptor but it actually you need to buy with 10 euro. Also,  they rent wifi is for 10 euro one day not 3 euro.  When I book the airport bus, they said 18euro with 8 deposit. However, it turns out to be 26 euro with a single person. Try to avoid this one ! Really noisy one!!!!!!!!!",0
65194,"Took us a little while to find but eventually did and figured out the metro. The room was small but the bathroom was so small you had to have a degree on where to stand to get out. The bed was broken and standing on a paint pot. We were moved rooms which was above the metro so was noisy all night. The shower door had no seal (we didn't realise until after) so it was like a river in the bathroom. Unfortunately I wouldn't stay here again - shame because the pictures of the rooms look beautiful and they offer you wine, cheese etc which we never saw. Breakfast was in the cellar very very cramped and limited. ",0
65304,Worst customer service ever. Will never stay at this place again. Double billed and manager wouldn’t speak to me. From check in to check out it was a terrible experience. No conditioner in rooms and no Saturday breakfast was available.,0

65333,"While I was at work the hotel checked me out then threw out and stole my belongings. Front desk gave me an ""oops"" while realizing they made a mistake. Completely unprofessional way to handle something as serious as this. Nothing has been done to compensate me for my stolen or trashed possessions which I needed to purchase again immediately while traveling for work.",0
65334,"We stayed a second time as the first time was reasonably good. Second time we had so many problems. Keys didn't work numerous times, the bathroom fan next door was screaming the second night and no staff to fix it, so towels were used in the adjoining doorway, iron was covered with glue or gum. They even replaced the toilet seat with one that was too small and reservoir tank cover that was too big and the toilet paper holder fell off. Very unprofessional. Continental breakfast consisted of exactly cold eggs, bacon, yogurt, bread, cereal but no bowls for cereal, black bananas and coffee. So we had to go out twice for breakfast as it just looked very sad. The hallway was dirty and not vacuumed in the two days we were there. What I can say is the location was very good to shopping and decent restaurants. This extremely overpriced for what it was.",0
65335,They roof was leaking so my entire bed was wet. There were no other rooms cleaned so we just ended up leaving. The front desk lady was really friendly but there was no way I was sleeping in a wet bed or waiting for them to clean a room correctly being low staffed.,0
65339,"La Quinta, Domain, in Austin TX should be a premier destination.  Instead there is trash and beer cans on the south side, the plants are dead and haven't been tended in over two years.  There was no hot water during my stay although the front desk said the problem would be resolved within the hour when I checked in.  The room doors onto the patio do not work with one's key card and there is nothing the staff can do about that.  The last time I stayed there only one ice machine worked for the expanse of the first floor.  To top it off, the folks in the adjoining room were quite loud with their amorous (?) efforts, conversations and partying.  The night clerk was at least apologetic even though her reassurances never were fulfilled.  The day clerk the next morning was hostile or indifferent to my reaction to a poor experience.  I demanded a refund and am looking for another venue for my Austin stays.   ",0
65341,DO NOT STAY HERE!  I was in my room for less than 15 minutes and a freaking bed bug is crawling across the sheets. They told me they could not refund until bed guys came in and verified it. The dead bug in a kleenex and pics weren't good enough of proof!,0
65356,"I chose this hotel because it was the closest to St David’s where my newborn was in the NUCU. I needed a good nights sleep after having a c-section 4 days prior. Upon entering my room I found hair in the bed, trash in trashcan, clothes iron left out, as well as just general dirty surfaces. Not sure if there were any other issues with that room because I called the front desk and asked for another room. 2nd room I found 3 long hairs plus more in the bed. I called the front desk and asked for a full refund and left.   This hotel gives the Wyndham chain a bad name. Reading prior reviews this is pretty typical for this property. Shape up or change your name. NO EXCUSE!!! ",0
65360,Shared the room with bugs so that is never fun. I also thought it was strange that any type of room cleaning during the stay was not done due to Covid. Not sure why they couldn’t leave new towels and toilet paper at the door but it is what it is,0
65435,Noise from the train.. internet not working at the level 6 room 607.. smeling pillows.. tiny room.. and finally problems with the room light.. not Tokyo standard. I would say the location and the price does not worth the problems,0

65826,"We asked separate beds for 2 nights the beds were made like it was a double bed, unacceptable. The 2nd time we had to ask for the correct sheets (Monday night) and as the reception stated no service was available we had to change and make up the beds ourselves. Also we left some papers related to our voyage on a table which were thrown away. Also own shower cap + handtowel were removed from the room. The shower door is not fully extended leaving an opening resulting in very wet bathroom floor we had to continuously clean. Also toilet paper lacking last day.. ",0
65939,"For the prices they charge in this place, you should be getting top-notch service. Unfortunately, you don’t and, in fact, the bar and wait staff at the bar can get downright rude. Also, the homeless camp right across the street did not make me want to hang out on W. 6th St. much at all.",0

66257,"Stayed for 2 nights in early March.  Weather was Still very chilly, 1 to 2 degree c at night. Hotel is in good location hence I chose it. But I did not know that there was a major building under construction just next to hotel manu. It was so noisy, you can hardly sleep. Construction is 24/7 and hotel stick a signage that the can provide ear plugs. Worst nightmare!! Called the reception and asked them why is the heater nor the air conditioning not working. They said during this period they disabled it in the entire property. Omg! Room has no ventilation.  So I insisted on having 2 fans.  To top it all, the entire room only has one PowerPoint. Plug in the fan and you can’t charge your phone or other devices. Worst hotel I have ever stayed.  The staff attitude is also like take it or leave.  I am appalled that there is such hotel exist in this century.  ",0
66308,"After myself and a colleague both booking hotel cars to pick us up at the airport, neither of them arrived, even after I messaged the hotel for confirmation on the day, not a good start. Upon arrival at the hotel I explained to the guy behind the front desk about the cars, he didn't seem too bothered. He then told me that the king non smoking room I had booked a week earlier wasn't available, only a smoking room or a non smoking with twin beds, it was 04.30am and I was tired, so opted for the twin room, when I got to the 4th floor my room key wouldn't work, so I had to drag my bags back down to the lobby, where the guy reset my key, when I got to my room the key still wouldn't work, so, back down to the front desk again, this time he gave me two keys, and sent a member of staff with me, neither key worked, we then waited for a maintenance guy to open the door for me, only to find there was already a guest inside! At this point I was fuming, this is the second time I've experienced the incompetent front desk staff at this hotel. The bellboy went back downstairs and came back with a key for a non smoking King room, which I was told was unavailable! Overall it took roughly an hour to get into my room, words cannot describe how I was feeling after a 20 hour journey to the hotel, only to be put through all of that nonsense, completely unacceptable service from this hotel. I am lifetime titanium elite member, and have never had this status recognised when checking into this hotel, it counts for nothing. My company have been using the hotel for many of my colleagues to stay in over the past year, but I think we'll stay at the JW or Meridian in future, they're a little further from the airport, but when you factor in the lengthy check ins and check outs at the Marriott, and I mean lengthy, we'll be better off staying at one of the other two mentioned, and a higher class of service!",0
66385,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS  I wasn't expecting a great experience from this airport hotel, however I didn't expect to be staying in a hotel where I was constantly worried about my own personal safety.

This got me extremely concerned. When I got the new room, and for the first time in my life, I had to put a chair behind the room door during my entire stay to hear if anyone walks in on me, especially at night.   The same night and at the entrance, there was a security guard with an x-ray machine and he clearly saw I was carrying cash in my laptop bag. He stopped me to ask about what currencies I am carrying and also wanted to know what a $100USD bill looks like, because he had never seen one before. This got me even more concerned. Because of this, I didn't leave any cash or any of my watches in the room during my stay and had to carry all my belongings with me to the conference and the meetings that I attended during my trip.  Finally, during my second night at the hotel, and at 1AM in the morning, the night shift receptionist (Faisal) started calling my room claiming I only booked for one night not two. He also sent a person to knock on my door. I am not sure why he was calling me 12 hours after normal check out time.

She wanted to refund us 3 pancakes. Not 4 because one was already made. She saved it for us😳 (see picture). Long discussion followed were she blamed us that we should have informed her staff better😱. Finallly she made a call and than she could refund us almost everything. Loftel 22 really is a nice place, although the mattresses are hard, it's oke price-quality wise. But just remember if you are with a group... Take enough time to order food at the cafe. Or take your breakfast somewhere else... That's what we will do the two more days we are here.",0
67087,"Complete strangers walked into our room 3am. Hotel gave them our room key and called it computer error. Aside from personal liability, all our belongings were in the room. If we were not in room we could had lost our passports and belongings to strangers. ",0
67090,"Horrible front office staff, even though rooms were available, we were not given 30 mins early check in, below par service standards. The staff mentioned that it is a management policy to charge  half day room rent even if it is for 30 mins. I cant imagine the commercial mindset of this hotel.",0
67091,Had an extremely bad stay. Staff is very uncoordinated. Kept on making us change rooms. Charged extra rent almost as much as rent for one day for early checkin which we already notified them about and which was subject to availability as mentioned during booking,0
67205,"I arrived in Shangri-la Suzhou at approximately 4pm. I was not even greeted by the front desk. I assume that she(Jane) was the manager as she was in a suit and a badge indicating her role as a manager unlike other staff, but Jane was very unprofessional and rude. The way she got my attention to go up to the front desk was like calling her pet dog with her hand gestures. Her disgusting attitude towards the guests is totally unacceptable and spoiled my mood for my entire business trip. Also my room reeked of the smell of cigarette even though i was on a non-smoking level. I also felt like there was no security as the lifts in the hotel did not require any form of key card to be tapped before being able to go up. Therefore anyone could simply go up to any level, causing a breach in security. It was an utterly disgusting and disappointing visit to Suzhou Shangri-la, i would not come back again.",0
67206,"Shabby 5 star hotel ever!! Staff at front desk are not obliging and do not treat their guest nicely - shouting at customers in face their face? really? Is that how a 5 star hotel service should be? Bedsheet are being changed everyday, however, yellow spots and stains can be found on the bedsheet. I requested for a non-smoking level but was given a malodorous level due to the heavy pungent of cigarette and the carpet which i assume they do not vacuum.   Shangri-La is an international brand which has established its brand hallmark of 'hospitality from the heart', absolutely crestfallen. Hospitality was not even serve from the heart, compared to other Shangri-La hotels i have been to, this is the WORSE HOTEL EVER. Just shut it down. ",0
67239,"Shangri-La Suzhou used to be the best hotel in Suzhou but something has changed since I was here 6 months ago.  The Horizon Club lounge used to have the best experience of any Shangri-La in China.  Sadly this is not true anymore.  Although people come to the lounge, many leave because there is no food out and tonight only one person working the entire lounge.  No sign of the chef (if there is one) and with people constantly coming and going the one staff has to stay at the desk.  I had to go to the staff at the desk and ask for another bottle of red wine to be brought out and moments later I saw another person do the same for a white wine.  The menu was limited to fish sticks, bacon wraps, broccoli, chicken wings, and mushrooms.  Each small serving in a separate dish and only 6 dishes at a time.  It’s really crazy!  I’ve never experienced this before at any Shangri-La (my favorite hotel in Asia).  Usually they are refilling my glass and asking about my day...  i called the duty manager to discuss the issue and he couldn’t have been more than 20.  He was apologetic but didn’t even ask my name or room.  About a half hour later, I finally saw the chef come out to check on the food.  He was also no more than 20.  Don’t get me wrong about the staff here.  They are all very friendly and make me feel at home like all Shangri-La hotels.  Maybe they are using this hotel as a training facility now?  I don’t know...  It’s really disappointing and I am therefore writing about the experience to express my frustration.  ",0
67303,"Just an awful hotel. The rooms are tiny to the point where the bathroom door hits the toilet. Also, the air conditioner makes a loud bang when it goes on, every 20 minutes or so, then makes another loud noise when it turns off. Impossible to sleep. Oh, the Wi-Fi, awful. Room 314 is to be avoided. Just awful. I’m exhausted.",0
67406,"I made a reservation with Guesthouse Gotic last week through Agoda, which is the same platform as Booking dot com. According to the booking a EUR payment was to be collected by the property as a non-refundable pre-payment. I paid online by credit card.  During the night after I made my booking my credit card was charged in GBP for a different amount than the contractually agreed EUR amount. The property only has a minimalist webpage with only a phone number and no email address to contact. I tried to contact them via Agoda customer service, which is a hellish experience and called them to have the charge reversed, or a written confirmation that this is only supposed to be a pre-authorization, which will be reversed once I pay in EUR at the property.  Via phone they lied to me and claimed that they had not charged my credit card, which was a blatant lie since I had my credit card statement in front of me.  Via Agoda support they eventually acknowledged that they indeed charged my card with a fraudulent amount but both Agoda and the property exhibited an utter incompetence in getting the issue resolved.  After several days back and forth via Agoda automated support system and several phone calls to the property, my booking was eventually cancelled without my consent and the fraudulent amount PARTIALLY refunded by the property. I made a loss since they probably refunded the fraudulent GBP amount and not the actual EUR amount.  This cost me a substantial amount of time and nerves and is due to corrupt business practices and utter incompetence, STAY AWAY!",0
67559,"The hotel acted high and mighty. I and my friends took the shuttle bus to Gimpo Airport. But the bus took us to Incheon. You know… they confirmed the reservation when you booked、boarded. The bus driver shouted us and let us went Gimpo by ourselves. The worst is that the manager told us the hotel had thing wrong ,they will pay the fare to Gimpo. When we back our country , the manager told us that we booked a shuttle bus to  Incheon , it’s our fault. they didn't apologize . Anyway, the hotel is irresponsible. They will go back on their word.   出爾反爾的飯店與飯店經理，明明確認過幾次的飯店接駁將我們送錯機場，司機無禮外，經理說願意負責，等我們回國後，再把錯推給我們。",0
67573,"This Hotel is conveniently located in Myeong-dong area. The only plus.   But we encountered a lot of issues/problem during the stay.  1. Upon arrival we checked in at the front desk and a guy who  doesn’t have any name plate assisted me. I have several questions and he said “stop talking” with a hand gesture. 2. The a/c inside our room wasn’t working retaining the 26 degrees temperature which wasn’t really comfortable. I tried telling them 3 times but wasn’t fixed during pur 4 night stay.  3. The lounge access wasn’t really worth it paying extra.  4. They made a mistake regarding my bill. We stayed at the lobby for an hour to wait for the bus shuttle but did not realize the error they made. Upon arrival at the airport we weren’t allowed to go down the bus and an “employee” ( claimed he is) in civilian clothes, without any if id with him told me to pay them the balance i “owe” them. A girl who wasn’t even apologetic over the phone which the guy handed me. demanded me to pay them the money i owed them. I told them it’s your mistake and now you are harassing me? This is something that can be handled properly if they can communicate in a nice way. But the way they approach me and told me about the error wasn’t really right and even told me i cannot ever leave the country. THIS HOTEL MADE ME FEEL UNSAFE IN SEOUL.",0

I emailed customer service and was told that can't be true. I have sent in pictures of double payment and transactions and was told finance is working on this and will issue a refund that was 6 days ago. I followed up with email, no response. So 7 days have passed and still dont have a refund.  Also, if you didnt know, when you book through Booking.com it just hold the reservation, they will send you an email 24 hours before arrival to make the payment and behold that payment system is broken as well. How can you pay for your booking when it is broken. I am supposed to arrive tomorrow and already frustrated.  I was not offered any accommodation for the trouble and lack of technological issues. We'll see when i arrive tomorrow but as of now i can't pay for my online booking and still waiting on a refund for when i was charged twice.  Keep in mind you pay interest on credit card charges and if the hotel doesnt reimburse you or even try to own their mistake, do you really want to stay there?",0

22967,"The hotel is in a ""Red light"" district, some distance away from the nearest Metro terminus. We found a distinct lack of places to eat at night other than the odd cafe/bar style food. There was a recommended place next door however most of the menu was crossed off & priced high. The ""free"" mini shuttle bus to the metro was charged for on the final bill!! We found the sights of Rome wonderful ...but watch out for ""pickpockets"" we were robbed of my wallet cash & cards, police said it is common. Taxi drivers say they have no meters & charge almost twice the proper fee to tourists. Be prepared to queue for 2-3 hours to see the Vatican which is miles away from the hotel. Overall the hotel is in an industrial area well away from the centre of Rome so most of the day is spent traveling to & fro on filthy overcrowded graffiti smitten underground systems . On the positive side the most helpful member of staff being the multi lingual barman who was so helpful & knowledgeable (Diran) We would not return to such an out of town place, our nights were spoiled not being able to enjoy evenings in Rome!!! We did loose some clothes too? & if late to your breakfast 8-30am no orange juice or bread left. (breakfast opens & closes 6.30 -10 am)",1

57693,"I had a very pleasant experience staying at Wake up Sydney for 5 days. It is situated opposite to central station, so it is excellent for access to train, tram and bus services. The hostel was modern and there there was plenty of space to move about in the dormitories.   The facilities were clean and all the staff were really friendly. One of the staff members Charlotte introduced me to the side bar, which is situated below the hostel. The bar had excellent meal and drink deals for people staying at the Hostel. All in all my stay at Wake Up was pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hostel to stay at in Sydney. ",1
46427,"So this is supposed to be a beach hotel, that's why I stayed several days to enjoy Barcelona topless beaches.  Location: The best part, is very well located, indeed close to the beach, a short walk of 10 minutes.  Rooms: Although the rooms have all the modern facilities, it also lacks from some basic ones - No minibar/fridge in the room! How can a beach hotel don't have a minibar for the cold drinks after coming from the beach - No waste bin, yes there's not a waste bin in all the room, you have to go to the toilet to find one, so if you seat in the room's table you have to take your trash to the bathroom next to the toilet.  Breakfast: This is one I didn't like but not for the breakfast itself but for the way they try to make you have it. I don't know what happens with Ibis but they thing we are not in an hotel but in a fast food chain like where you have to pick up your food tray, eat on it and return it to the trash shelf. Like been in a jail or something or military service. Off course I didn't do it, but it was kinda unpleasant to feel like it was compulsotory or something when you were eating and the employees stared at you.  Pool: small, and full of children jumping and playing so better to stay on the beach  Reception: The best part of all, specially for the always smiling Italian girl , chiara.  Thanks",1

36087,I chose this location first because of the location and secondly because it is a Hilton.  When we arrived I expected an energetic and informative reception but was greeted by a lackluster staff who was determined to do the bare minimum.

65160,"Hotel is in a quiet back road. On arrival there was a pleasant, small reception area and the staff were very friendly and welcoming - but that, unfortunately, is where the good bits end.   We were given a room on 5th Floor and due to the main lift being out of action were offered use of a small service lift - barely large enough for two people.  Corridors both on ground level and outside our room were cluttered with large bags of hotel linen and cleaning items - which remained in situ throughout our stay.  Our room was extremely small and the bathroom even smaller!!!  The bathroom offered minimal space and had cracked tiles and a broken shower.  Our room was at the back of the hotel and was above the railway line and so there was rail noise until late at night and restarting in the early morning. There were coffee/tea making facilities in the room however the only cups for hot drinks were plastic and completely unsuitable.  We chose not to take the option of breakfast during our stay preferring to eat out so am unable to comment on this.  It was well placed for sight-seeing and plenty of places to eat within easy reach.  I will definitely return to Paris but I will not be staying here again and would not recommend it to others.",1
5981,"The hotel located just off the via Nazionale and a short 10-15 minute walk from the main train terminal, is ideal for the Vittorio Emmanuele II monument and the other major archaeological sites of central Rome. Despite this location we found it a very quiet hotel, with little street noise etc. The hotel is typical of Rome, relatively small on the first floor of a block with economy and standard rooms. We had an economy double which we found comfortable for our extended weekend break, though the on-suite was a bit small. If we'd been staying longer and had more than one suitcase the more expensive standard rooms would have been better. We did actually see a couple of these bigger rooms and they looked equally comfortable with bigger on-suites. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was typical continental style with an assortment of cold meats, cheeses, eggs, tomatoes, breads, pastries etc. There were a couple selections of cereals and yogurt. Coffee and tea were ordered separately and certainly the coffee was good. Overall the breakfast was more than adequate for our needs at the start of the day. The Wi-Fi and A/C were good.",1
42369,"This hotel was reasonably priced for the location. Includes everything you need (clean, up to date, water included). The staff are friendly and accommodating.  The room is very small (which makes sense in Tokyo) and if you are travelling with friends you may find the clear bathroom uncomfortable (as mentioned in other reviews). While there are curtains it may still be a little awkward. As a couple it wasn't issue, however I did find it added a clinical feel to the room which wasn't the best.  We found the mattress to be too firm for our tastes and it did give both my partner and me sore backs. If you prefer a firmer mattress this may be great.  Being in Shibuya the location is great, and the part of Shibuya it is in is nice. There are loads of food options and it is just the right amount away from the crazy Shibuya crossing. On the downside it is quite a walk (just under ten mins) to the train station.   There were no laundry facilities and there is no wash and fold within walking distance. There is a coin laundry nearby.  I would stay here again, however would prefer something closer to a station (even if it meant being in a less popular spot i.e. outside of Shibuya).",1

This would be acceptable if it were a two star hotel but given the price of €300 and being a top 5 star hotel in Brussels, I was dissatisfied with the state of the room and the quality of breakfast didn’t match the status of this establishment.   I would not return here and hope that the management team ensure that they can present clean rooms to their guests in the future.",1
8488,"I stayed with my family for 9 nights and the hotel was a disappointment. Some good things are the fact that it is surrounded by a supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants of all kinds (however, it takes between 7-10 min to walk to get to Toyocho train station, the closest to hotel). Also, it is good that the Airport Limousine Bus from/to Narita and Haneda Airport stops here. The concierge service is good and they were efficient in booking our Airport Limousine Bus tickets and giving us the right information about things related to Tokyo. Room service was also good, they responded immediately.  Unfortunately, the good things end here. There are a lot of things that are not matching average international standards. If the service continues this way, I don't see how the hotel can attract international visitors for the Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Tokyo Olympics 2020. These are the things were the hotel did not do well during our stay: 1) Since we traveled with a 1-year old kid, the hotel installed a child guard in one of the beds. The problem was that one day after staff cleaned the room, the child guard was installed in the wrong way, there was a big hole and our son could have fallen through it. 2) After check-in, we noticed our room had not been cleaned properly, we found a sock from a previous guest behind a sofa. 3) This is the only hotel in the world that I know where guests have to pay to use the gym 4) After we checked-out, the front desk forgot to give us a parcel that a friend had sent to us. They only noticed after we had arrived to the airport and they had to send it to us by airmail.(They acknowledged they forgot to give it to us) 5) Staff in the lobby lounge were not considerate. One morning, my son asked me to take him to the fountain in the lounge lobby. The lounge was almost empty, one two tables taken. I sat with my son in a sofa next to the fountain and I am asked what I wanted to order. When I told them I was just staying here for my son to watch the fountain, they asked us to leave the lobby lounge, no matter I explained we were staying in this hotel.  6) Some staff in the front desk cannot understand English well. 7) Trash bins in the hotel rooms are too small. 8) Only one English channel on TV (CNN)  My advice is to only stay here if you did not find accommodation in another hotel in Tokyo and/or you have to do something around Koto, Toyocho area",1

What happened to courtesy of coming over to give the key or an apology for the inconvenience?  Found a piece of steel scrub in our scrambled egg! when we told the staff - ""let me check"" - comes back after 10 min - ""sorry about that""  Would this be the response to any guest or is this type of response reserved for Indians?  Day of checkout, we leave luggage in the lobby to finish breakfast, Person at the reception shouts out rudely Staff - I am not responsible if you lose your luggage Me - I haven't placed it outside the hotel on the pedestrian path for someone to cart if off, its inside the hotel Staff - I am not responsible Me - Then what are you responsible for Staff - My desk Me - Ok. move the luggage to the restaurant  Btw, I did notice that other guests did leave their luggage at the very same place and other reception staff didn't have such statements to make to them (of course, those guests were not from India)  Is this how guests are treated at this hotel?

32530,"I have been to Mexico over 10 times, I have stayed in a different resort every single time. This was my first time at this one, I went on a girls trip with three girls who have never been to Mexico. I was utterly disappointed with this whole trip and had to hold it together for the sake of my friends. The resort appearance to start is just not welcoming, not comfortable and just over whleming. The check in area is crowded, your stuck standing for possibly over an hour as they get you together. The room we booked was not what we got. They trick you by saying there's an ocean view and an ocean front. We got the view, which I understood was partial of the ocean, when I got into the room, my view was a tennis court and the kids play area with screaming kids all day. I went down to the front desk over 8 times before someone actually spoke to me and the front desk was rude and had me waiting over an hour to even get another room. The room they ended up giving me was just as bad, literally it was one room over. At that point I was over the whole trip. They only have two pools, in which one is by the kids play area so it's not relaxing at all. The food was the absloute most disappointing thing about this trip. The options never changed, the buffet was disappointing, no varitey of meats, chickens or fish. I had to basically beg them to get us some shrimp for once. Nightlife sucks, there isnt even a nice enough lobby to sit and relax at. They had a show one night that was decent. Their resturants had a waitlist every night, I've never had that issue at any resort before. The staff just was rude and not helpful. I was so disappointed, I hate that I spent a dollar there. The rooms were never stocked with snacks, the housekeepers wouldn't fill the fridge if we took something out. I had to constantly call for more water. And to top it off, I would have to call room service two or three times before I even got through to someone. I pick all inclusive resorts because I want to relax, I want to be catered to after working hard and catering to others. This resort won't give you that. I cannot express how much I want to talk you out of booking here, look at other options and let this be your absolute last resort.  ",1

Given the size of the rooms you can hear your neighbours coughs and conversations. The street it is located in is quiet.   The service was fine although reception were on the phone a lot while we were their however ultimately depends who you get. You can get an Iron however have to pick it up yourself from reception. We arrived early however our room did not seem to be available. Tea is available in the rooms but you have to ask for milk from reception.

9532,"We booked this trip as a staycation for our family.   When we arrived we were greeted by the valet, his first words were “The Carkpark is full”, if you have something to say about it talk to the front desk, no hello or welcome.   We arrived at 3:00 and due to the massive wait we accepted a free drink card to wait at a bar. Unfortunately none of the drinks we like were available with these cards.   We tried to checked in at 3:30 and was told the room was ready but needed to be checked and would be ready in a few minutes. We waited 30 minutes and went and checked and got the same answer. We then waited another 30 minutes and finally was able to get our key (4:25pm) - so we had been waiting an hour and a half.   In the mean time we ordered a bottle of champagne in the chandelier bar, but after 28 minutes wait we were told you didn’t have it.   After we checked in we went to the members lounge, we ordered a cocktail which took 1.5 hours to get, meanwhile other guests were supplied multiple cocktails when we followed up our order we just keep being told there’s a long list and they are full capacity although we saw guests getting multiple drinks in between. While waiting for this we tried our luck with another bottle of champagne which took about 30 minutes to arrive.   After this we gave up and went back to our room. After putting our we girl to bed (Which we had to re-request) your turndown service knocked on the door at 9:25pm, oh and no child’s gift pack like advertised.   Once in bed we realised our room was under the lounge, so we listened to furniture getting knocked and moved around till 10:30ish pm, then again at 3:30am and then it started again at 6am   The pods you supplied for the coffee machine were incorrect and would not fit.   We were reasonably calm throughout all of this to just keen-getting told, sorry we are a bit busy tonight.  We are sorry we are full compactly    After asking to speak to the manager and explaining some of the issues we were greeted by a gentleman that didn’t introduce himself or his position but lead us to believe he was a manager, until he had to go out the back and speak to his manager.     We we’re offered 25% off and a gift pack with no other option, we took this as we aren’t normally the people to make a scene and we’re too tied to argue as we hadn’t really slept.

66571,"Atrocious, Unacceptable and Bad behaviour to say the least. Horrifying experience at Sofitel, BKC, Mumbai Front Office.   I made an online room booking “for a guest of mine”, through Booking.Com. The booking process was smooth. Since it was a pre-paid booking, I have mentioned my credit card details “and authorization” at the time of booking. The confirmation email sent by both Booking.com and the hotel clearly mentioned that my credit card will be charged, and NO payment will be required at the hotel. The test authorization was also done on my credit card at the time of booking. There was NO mention that the credit card used for the online booking needs to be produced physically by the “Guest” at the time of check-in.  Like any other check-in process around the globe, my guest checked in using the booking confirmation details.  The front office representative – specially Mr. Ashish and his colleague / Duty Manager Mr. Gaurav - literally tortured my guest to produce the physical credit card or make a cash payment immediately to retain the booking. My guest was almost making the cash payment when I coincidentally called and realized the misbehavior of the hotel guys with my guests.  When I spoke to Mr. Ashish and Mr. Gaurav over the phone, they were very rude and mentioned that it is the hotel policy to not charge the credit card that’s mentioned in the booking and ask the person checking-in for payment at the front office. I asked why they did not mention at the time of booking, and they had no answer.  I mentioned that they could have at least called me and asked for payment rather than bothering & torturing my “guests” and making them wait, again they had no answer.  Finally, after wasting a lot of time of my guest and making him wait for long hours, and of course a lot of embarrassment, they sent me a payment link on sms and I made the payment, post which a room was allotted.   This was least expected from a brand like Sofitel, located at a prime location of BKC, Mumbai.  Of course they have lost a loyal customer (and a corporate client) and I would discourage anyone who would seek feedback from me to ever stay there.  My 2 cents to the hotel & brand Accor – (i) Ensure proper training & induction of their staff on guest management and not to create an experience like this (II) Fix your processes and partnership with ecommerce brands. Clearly communicate the policies and expectations. Be aligned to how hotel industry works globally. Weird rules without notification to guests will only give you disgruntled customers and poor publicity.   Atrocious, Unacceptable and Bad behaviour to say the least.",1
67408,"Now this is a hostel I am willing to stay at again!    A friend and I stayed in a private room for 3 nights... good price for the location.  Spacious room, feels very clean.  Bathroom down the hall, and not too many people to a bathroom, as I never saw another person! 🙌🏻  I haven’t stayed in many hostels and had one bad experience, but Barcelona Gotic opened my mind.  Very modern decor.  Location and the hostel itself feel very safe.  2-3 blocks from La Rambla and metro stops.  Everything was very hotel-Like, which is pretty much the only way I’ll go.  Front desk allowed us free locker space when we first arrived while we went out on the town waiting for our room to open up.  Would definitely recommend for lodging in the Gotic Quarter, and Barcelona in general.  Happy I stayed here.",1
66012,"On the face of it, this is a magnificent property with a superb location and a distinguished past. The problem is that in the present, it appears seriously mismanaged, such that its best years are behind it. During my recent stay I found a number of basic things missing that are common fare for other top hotels in California and the following deficiencies:  — A lack of basic amenities such as free water in the room — we had to ask for it every night;  — Automatic free access to the hotel gym; turns out it was managed by a separate company and therefore required faffing around with an Accor membership for which I cared little. Which other 5 star hotel in the world  erects unexplained barriers to such basic amenities as gym use?  — A checkin process more focused on trying to extract extra dollars via unnecessary upgrades than on delivering useful info to the client; — No bathrobes or slippers provided in the rooms: at most top hotels these are elementary items but here they have to be requested; — A deficiency in basic facilities in the room such as adequate drawers and storage space for clothes; — An absence of normal services such as evening turn-down; — Patchy and sometimes very slow responses from front desk and other services. Overall, this is clearly a property where the owners are more focused on extracting cash for themselves than on providing a 5 star experience for their guests. A property of this size and potential quality requires exceptional management — but this is not what this hotel is getting. And in addition it is obvious that the fabrics of the rooms and public areas are tired and in need of renewal. Overall, a very considerable disappointment.",1
37136,"Good thing: this was a cheap Iberostar-hotel - the cheapest one of this brand that we have been to so far. Our problem though: we had the same expectations of quality standards as in the other Iberostar-hotels that we have been to already - that was our main mistake, I guess. Overall, to European standards, some parts of the hotel experience are probably worth 3 stars, but not 4. First the good thing: much of the ""hard product"" is actually quite good: the corridors, swimming pools, sports areas, etc. are quite clean and well maintained (despite some chaotic equipment arrangement in the fitness room, the mini-golf being half covered with sand, and the plastic lining of the tennis courts being loose).  Some problems are probably related with the primitive overall development of the country as a whole; but still: if you build a hotel with a specific number of guests in mind, then all the standard facilities should be installed as function of that number. For instance: *we spent one evening without hot water *we spent one evening with repeated power outages in our building (not in other buildings, so not a national grid problem) *the WIFI jumps on and off the entire time, and there is a network without password, and then all of a sudden there is a password with login needed, which is never communicated but which is written down on a small sign next to reception. Don't count on getting any work done here, the WIFI is too unreliable.  Communication and organization is problematic: *no information brochure, nor explanation about facilities, nor map of the hotel, nothing. *if there is a problem then you can ""call reception""... there is indeed a telephone in the room, but there is no directory with numbers! More generally, there no directory or statement of facilities, services, ... ANYWHERE. There are probably still facilities in the hotel that we did not find, I found out the last day, for instance, that there was a second restaurant, which we never used. *I contacted the hotel prior to our stay via e-mail. Never received any reply. *This is also the first Iberostar branch were we did not get any recognition whatsoever for the loyalty status that we have with Iberostar. *As an extra example of the lack of communication and eye for detail: at the sign board next to the restaraunt announcing events, the spectacle to be held in the evening is only announcement approx. 1 out of every 2 days - the other day it is just left empty. This lack of attention to detail is disappointing.  Restaurant: *the variety of food is really not up to standard for Iberostar. Not enough variation - the same offer every morning, noon, evening, apart from one or two hot dishes that change. *No fruit apart from figs, apples, and oranges: every morning, noon, evening... Sometimes frozen strawberries. Where are the grapes, melons, pineapples, water melon, pears, ...? Also the ever-present cheeses are of terrible quality (were they frozen and defrosted?) *organization of the restaurant is terrible: no-one helps you find a table, so you have to walk in, find a dirty table that is not being used anymore, and then try to get a waiter's attention to clean it (which means: whipe the dirt off and flip over (!) the placemats). Why not have someone at the door show you to a table, like it is the case in many other Iberostar hotels? *organization of the restaurant (bis): many dishes, including pasta, meats, fish, ... are cooked on the spot per order/person, meaning that there is a long queue all the time (despite this being a buffet restaurant). At peak moments, the staff should make those ""to stock"" instead of ""to order"", meaning that they should be ready and available and guests should just be able to serve themselves with finished products immediately. *an easy fix already: label all the dishes! There a 7 jars with jam at breakfast, all with slightly different colors. Just put labels so that people know what is the strawberry, the fig, the apricot, etc. - how can we guess? The same for all other dishes: at the warm buffet, there is usually only one label ""cooked fish"" while there is no fish... Just put the actual names of the dishes there! I can imagine that this can be especially important also when someone wants to avoid specific ingredients such as pork/meat/dairy/... There were typically some labels for the juices, but those were more often wrong than correct.  Staff: *the animation team does its best and they are a friendly and pleasant bunch overall, this was a good experience. The mini-club, however, is managed in a rather chaotic manner (you always have to guess the hours, and very often it just remains closed despite the announced opening hours), and the older lady running the mini-club is simply plain rude to many guests - this is not how staff should treat guests (she talks to parents in a demeaning and demanding tone as if they were three-year olds).  That being said, the lady does have a very good way with kids. *the reception teams lacks professionalism, and especially lacks kindness. They are rude - if I pay for towels and you cannot give them immediately, and I come back a fourth (!) time to get them, and then you have the towels but you don't want to give them to me because you question whether I really need them???? COME ON!!! I also already entered all personal data of all travellers upon online check-in via the Iberostar platform (took me 15 minutes at home) - but why does the reception then again need 20+ minutes to process our check-in? At a normal hotel you just arrive and pick up your keys, here this takes WAY too long.  When they tell you to sit down and wait while they are working on your documents, and 20 minutes this is STILL the case, while you are trying to manage 3 kids who are tired from the journey, you easily get annoyed. *asked for late check-out multiple times - always was referred to the last morning of the stay. Again refused the last morning - had to get client service involved to be allowed a (paying) late checkout (while it was crystal clear that rooms were available, because a lot of tourist flights, were coming in very late in the evening, but our room was already assigned and they did not want to re-assign at first). *some of the waiters in the bar and the restaurant really show their complete disgust of their job. Perhaps the fact that we were visiting during Ramadan made more people more grumpy than usual, but this should not be reflected in the client experience. *even in the hotel, and esp. also at the beach, guests are constantly ""harassed"" by people selling massages, trips, excursions... These people were suits, badges, ... which make them seem ""official"", but their connection to the hotel is unclear, and possibly shady. I really don't want to be constantly brushing off salesmen during my stay, esp. not even when IN the hotel. *congrats to the cleaning staff: they are a very pleasant and kind group.  Despite all of this, the hotel seems to get very good reviews on some platforms. This can probably be at least partially explained by the fact that the animination staff is actively ""recruiting"" teenagers in the hotel to login to Tripadvisor and to leave a good review (happened to my 16-yo daughter).  By the way, one practical thing to note: you can pay in EUR in the hotel but you never get EUR back; they tell you to change them in the airport. The nasty thing is: there is a change office only BEFORE the passport checks, and all payments in the secured zone of the airport are ONLY in EUR. So we are now left with around 200 dinars that are useless to us. This, of course, is not the fault of the hotel, but it adds to the frustration at the end of an already sometimes frustrating stay.",1
6977,"Unfortunatly upon arrival we queued for 40 minutes only to be told our room was not ready, after 2 hours in the bar we received our keys. Our room was quite large and the bed was very comfy. Parts of the room had a basic reno including the very small bathroom. The shower over a bath was overly small and difficult to enter/exit. One wall was quite dirty and rubish from previous guests was found during our 5 day stay. The hotel is in a great location and very quiet with large rooms, however is not currently upto Novotel standard. The restaurant although shown as being open on the website was closed, so no dining discouts wer available. I would stay here again but only if standards increased substantually.",1
60238,"We chose this place because of the great reviews and what described as excellent host,  which is a reason we like B&B’s.  We spent five nights and saw Jon only twice at breakfast and he seemed more interested in his computer than his guests.  We never saw his wife.  There was no one around to help or answer questions and we were told we could email if we needed anything.  All very impersonal.  The place itself was fine.  Well located for Gaudi sites.  ",1
52036,"Very negative experience from many points of view: in the online description of the hotel it is not known any reference that the entrance is from the shopping center where there is a corner with a security officer and from where you take the elevators to go up to the 5th floor, where the reception is located. After a security check, which I do not understand why it is not on the ground floor, you enter a design entrance hall with zero practicality, especially if the security staff looks but does not speak! If you have many suitcases, as in my case, you have to arrange because nobody asks you if you need help ... At my demonstrations, the receptionist and the night manger told me that they MUST be the customers to ask for assistance … 4 stars hotel … Fast check-in but arrived in the room there is another nice surprise: the 25sqm superior room is not a room for a 15/16 square meter room ... and they have thought well to put a corner sofa instead of a free space to put the suitcases (there is no classic suitcase stand). The double bed positioned so indecent because from a high there are about 40cm to get off the bed, always to make room for an almost useless corner sofa! Another nice surprise are the plastic or paper cups and no teaspoons, in a 4 star it is unacceptable! The small room was as clean as the bathroom (perhaps with some improvements to the amenities). Good but a little complicated internet connection with multiple access codes (one for each element) Breakfast: good to be in Russia, quite varied but. another beautiful surprise, with a napkin broken by wear and by the little clever arrangement of the cutlery in the napkins that create this damage. Finally, the most unfortunate aspect for a hotel is the lack of seriousness of the manager who, urged on my part for explanations, did not show up but sent a staff member. Summarizing: choosing a 4-star means having a kind of reception and respect for the customers that this hotel does not show.",1
66639,"all in all rather disappointing experience, not like in the past. as a diamond accor member we were put in the noisiest room of all (stay away from the elevators, which by the way are a complete mess). on top, some rather painful and totally unnecessary payment issues at checkout. not to be recommended anymore, especially during high season.",1
12126,"the hotel far from the city, few guest, no need to long queue for food.  Hotel staff were nice, but John seems unskilled in using the card machine, he charge me 3 times the deposit.

But I need to print 60 pages, so I went to printing shop at Kowloon.  Dinner buffet was good. Lots of seafood for choose. Oyster was not very fresh. Botan shrimp was extremely good. Chinese soup was delicious. Pancake has cream eventually.  Under the COVID-19, the Lounge allocated at 1/F next to front desk area. No staff check my access.  When I get on the shuttle bus, The cockpit was empty, I went back to lobby and ask the staff, she said the driver will start on time, I was waiting near the front door outside that coach.

44334,"Had a one-night staycation. The main purpose was to enjoy a BUFFET breakfast. Called to confirm one month before stay and also before booking, and the staff told us that yes there is a BUFFET breakfast. The website also had no indication of any changes.  When we checked in, the lady at the counter was very rude, spoke in an impolite tone and seemed to feel ""annoyed"" that she had to interrupt what she was doing to check us in. Didn't provide us with any information, such as how to access the internet or asked us if we needed help with our bags. Service was more like a 2-stay hotel. No Japanese bow either. We definitely did not feel ""welcomed.""  Worse - she informed us (when we asked) that the breakfast would be set menu and NOT a BUFFET.   While the hotel advertises on their website that they follow hygiene standards, etc, we found that many staff did not wear masks, and only put them on when they see guests. This was the case in the restaurant where they served breakfast - all of the staff did not have masks on. They also did not use gloves or face shields.   Another complaint is that the menu stated that the Western option included a ""bread basket,"" however, they only gave us toast.  We asked for croissants and were given two small pieces (one per person) and not offered any more.   Lastly, they did not have anyone checking our temperatures once we got off the elevator from the parking garage. They also didn't have people at all doors/entrances at night.   For a Japanese hotel, they did not properly follow Thai government rules concerning COVID-19 measures.  When we left the elevator to go to the parking garage, there was also no QR code for us to ""check out"" from the Thai government  Thai Channa application. There was no way for us to ""check out.""   This hotel ""appears"" to be a five-star hotel, but it is all smoke and mirror.   Poor management (never once did we see any Japanese staff or manager) who does not care about the hotel.  When asked to speak to a manager, he/she was conveniently in a meeting.   Complaints made at front desk, but no follow up. No attempt was made to address customers' concerns during our stay.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.",1
33694,"On arrival I informed the receptionist ( only found out now he is actually the hotel manager) that I would be extending my stay. Shiva (manager) advised me to book directly with reception for the best rate. The next day I went to extend my stay which seemed to be an issue as it was not as simple as I would of thought considering he had known I was going to extend.   I was charged $204 per night to stay in the same room, paid the amount thinks I was getting the best rate from the person who told me I would.   Got back to my room and went online to check the rate to see that I was charged the same rate as a 1 bedroom suite (original room was junior).  I called Shiva and was told that ""that was weird considering I got the rate online"" asked to moved to the 1 bedroom the following day as I had already paid for the room.  Sent a few emails to the email address they tell you to send any requests through to advising that I would like a late check out and if they could send through via email confirmation, with no response. Ended up extending for another night and asking for a late check out on my final day, again via email. This time I received an acknowledgement and the time I could stay to.   As this was my final day I wanted to  sleep all day before having to go back to work.   I put a do not disturb sign in the door and started to relax ONLY to hear knocking on the door with DND sign from the HOTEL MANAGER.   I do not know any other reason to wake a guest after a request was made to have a late check out and the DND sign other than thinking someone was dead inside.  Called head office to let them know and also give them the opportunity to explain/rectify the situation   There was only an apology and request for more information so the relevant departments could be notified.

52194,"Amenities was better than the other Hilton that I've stayed previously. For me, the staff is what makes or breaks stays in the hotel. The housekeeping, front lobby greeters/bell hops, lounge staff were all awesome. Executive lounge was good, staff were all good except for one lady named Zyon. I requested a small container so I can bring 2 slices of snacks as I am diabetic and need to snack later at night. She adamantly said no because of policy even though other guests take food out. I just felt belittled at that time and thought that my status as a diamond member was not even worth it. I surely didn't get treated like this when I stay at Marriott Manila. I didn't think that she valued me as a guest. Other than that I say that these Hilton staff were outstanding: executive lounge staff Cecilia (knowledgeable and well poised), MJ, Harry, Michael. Housekeeping staff Allan, was detail oriented friendly and always willing to help out. Concierge desk Lloyd and  John were always cheerful, helpful and attentive. For my return trip, I will be skipping Manila Hilton due to my negative experience at the executive lounge.",1

34523,This was one of the most disappointing stays I’ve had! The room for a family of four is so tiny we are falling over each other! This wouldn’t be too Much of an issue but the facilities within it are simply not good enough! The bathroom has no ventilation so after a shower the whole room is wet and mirror not useable! The room as a family room only has a shower which I appreciate for some Might be ok but how to do you effectively wash small children?  A family room to me should have a bath and maybe that’s just me but it certainly was not a “family” bathroom! The sofa bed for the children has hinges that stick out higher than the bed panel and my daughter pulled Herself out of bed and skinned her bottom on this hinge! It’s not fit for purpose and again not safe! I’m generally so massively disappointed in this hotel as a family room I will never stay here or recommend it to a family in good conscious,1

64215,I’m so conflicted about this review so I’m just going to preface this by saying the staff and GM are WONDERFUL and nice people. We were supposed to check out after 4 nights but ended up checking out after the first night. The GM refunded me the 3 nights we didn’t stay immediately and apologized profusely. They did try to move our room but we were so cranky and mad after having a horrible sleep/experience that we didn’t want to stay.  We arrived and there was a ton of locals staying here. This is obviously fine except they’re very loud. The wifi was super spotty and barely worked. The hotel is near a mosque so be prepared to wake up at 4am everyday. (We had just experienced this on Gili T for the last 5 days so we were excited to sleep in). The room had a really weird smell - I think it’s their cleaning products cause the room did appear clean. In the morning we were first awoken by the mosque and once we fell back asleep the guests beside us were being incredibly loud and smoking. This wouldn’t have been a problem if the rooms were sealed but they aren’t. So at 6am I woke up to our room filled with cigarette smoke. I’m not a smoker so this made me instantly nauseous and furious. I give this review 3* because the manager did tell us the big group that was causing issues was leaving that day so this may have been a one off experience,1

64184,"I have stayed here on about six occasions and have had multiple disappointing experiences. I have only kept (grudgingly) coming back because it is so close to my work. If you have any other options, I strongly encourage you to consider them.   --I needed help scanning a very important document for my work at 3:00am (after their business center was closed). The man at the front desk refused to help and went back to watching a movie on his phone. Mind you, this was a scan, not a copy (i.e. It costs the hotel $0, especially at 3:00 am when the lobby is empty and nobody is checking in).   --I went on a few day long trip away from Hong Kong and planned to return to the hotel afterwards. I took the hotel bus to the airport express station in Kowloon. Upon my return to Hong Kong, I planned to take that same bus back to the hotel. I went outside 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time at the same place it dropped me off at a few days earlier and the bus never came. Upon calling concierge, they said the bus had arrived at the scheduled time and already left. This is false. The area where the bus stops is not crowded at all so it would be inconceivable to miss one of the few busses coming into that area. Do not rely on this bus.   A couple of smaller negatives about the hotel:  --You WILL get a twin bed room if your travel agent does not guarantee room type. Among my roughly six stays, I have tried calling ahead, checking in at the earliest possible time, and leaving a note with my travel agent. All but one time I received a twin bed room. I'm convinced there are very few full size bed rooms in this hotel.   --They charge for luggage storage. Keep this in mind if you want to take a trip for a few days away from the hotel. This is unheard of at any reputable hotel brand (think Hyatt, Marriott, Holiday Inn, etc... ).  --General unenthusiastic attitude. Staff are a bit cold. I'd recommend that they be a bit more welcoming at check-in or at the door.   It wouldn't be fair if I didn't include a couple pros, so here they are:  --Bed is soft --Rooms are generally clean",1

The rooms are also quite surprisingly mediocre and could use upgrading. Our room's bathroom has a faint ""public restroom"" odor but since we only stayed for a night, we didnt bother to ask for room change.   The exteriors are great for photography though.",1
57980,"A nice hotel regarding the entrance, restaurant and bar. But if you come in short pants as guest no warm welcome! They should treat you same as others payers. The rooms with mold everywhere should not be there and close to the airco so  bad for the health. A no go for me!",1
12345,"It’s located in a nice location but the room & the toilet are really small. There is only one small& old  lift in the hotel with max capacity of 2 persons + 2 luggages.  With the similar price, i guess we can get a better hotel on the same street.",1
34705,"Hip, trendy and chic L7 is smack right in the Myeondong shopping paradise, sans the loud street sounds as it’s pretty high up affording a panoramic view. We had the cathedral view. It’s a bit of a squeeze here but they make up for the lack of space with Malin + Goetz toiletries. The most exciting part of the hotel is the foots that faces the Seoul Tower. There’s also a rooftop bar and restaurant. There’s a perky breakfast box every morning. It’s literally across Myeongdong station making this super accessible. Also, all the shopping streets are behind.  Unfortunately, I was tested COVID positive and sent the results late afternoon upon arrival. So I managed to have a quick walkabout before quarantine.Here are the quick lessons in a nutshell if you find yourself COVID positive while staying there: 1. The protocols are unclear. Front desk gave me conflicting information such as the need to do a second PCR test at 9 am the next morning (thankfully I slept through it). I was told not to leave the room. Then told to vacate the hotel as they aren’t a COVID hotel. 2. Koreans can be rude and cold. As we are living in Singapore which is super efficient and English-speaking, we aren’t used to the third-world citizen treatment the moment you’re COVID positive. You’re literally ostracised as lepers. Even taxi drivers refuse to take us (before I found out about COVID status) and taxi drivers will not help with your luggage into the boot. 3. You can’t just be hospitalised. The national health centre will contact you once you’re COVID positive. They will monitor you (I literally got a text from them saying “Mapo-gu public health centre will control you”. You have to apply for permission to be hospitalised. Even so, you will get rejected. My young son who was with me was vomitting so bad that he couldn’t be hospitalised. 4. At the Inje University Paik Hospital, 2 Beavis and Butthead security guards REFUSE to let us into the hospital. We had a very quick audience with someone kitted up outside. Thankfully, a foreigner who spoke Korean helped us negotiate for medication. People don’t speak English much in this country. Add COVID ostracism to the mix, you’re doomed.There’s seriously a lack of empathy in the cold city. 5. You can’t stay at a hotel while under quarantine. You got to pick a homestay at Wehome. It’s all pretty last minute so expect cut-throat prices with sad options. 6. Invest in a good insurance plan that gives you lump sum if you’re diagnosed with COVID. I found out ours only gave us medical coverage so the quarantine miserable days are out of our pockets. 6. It’s 7 days of quarantine then you are sent a notice 2-3 days after which you are then clear to fly. So be sure to buffer the days in.",1
56946,Reception staff were very aggressive. I came to meet a friend at the bar and I arrived early. The staff kept asking me what I was doing even though I told them I was waiting for a friend. They made me very unwelcome and I decided not to have a my drinks there and went to a place around the corner instead. ,1
66295,"The location of the hotel is good, able to walk from train station.  Can walk to shopping places easily & hv a casino nearby.  However, the hotel is quite small & sound insulation is not good.  There are sounds whenever people use bathroom next door & air con have a bit sounds also.",1
59956,"Very trendy and a bit self important. This tower hotel is well placed in Bangcock to take advantage of the sights. Food was OK, nothing special. Every surface in both rooms and public spaces is black or dark wood. OK so I am 75  years old but found the whole experience very difficult in all that blackness. Kept loosing my way not helped by the fact that you had to change lifts to get up to the bars and restaurant at the top. The bar had very loud 'music' blaring out so you couldn't hold a conversation with the person next to you! All very fashionable but a prime case of fashion over function. Hated it I'm afraid, though the staff were friendly.",1
7979,"A nice hotel in a GREAT location but beware do not expect AC to work. We were told it would be fixed the next day...and then the next day and so on. The rooms are tight and there is a tiny elevator and some steep spiral stairs. Also not super welcoming to families, the man at the desk often told us to quiet down after we were trying to get all of us in our room (2 rooms, party of 6). But all that aside the location is really unbeatable, close to Notre Dame and the Ile de la Cite metro stop is really close by too. Nightlife on Ile de Saint Louis is just around the corner, but not too loud.",1
27745,"The hotel is centrally located to all the shopping and food trips you can do in Myeongdong. The rooms are impeccably clean and spacious.   Just a comment on the customer service though. Just two days ago, on a Friday afternoon I asked the receptionist for help in getting a taxi going to Gwanghwamun, since the Kakao Taxi app I downloaded couldn't find a taxi for me. The response of the receptionist was, if I couldn't find a taxi thru the Kakao Taxi app, she also couldn't find a taxi for me since she also use the same app and she suggested that I just walk. It is a very peculiar response which I didn't expect coming from the hotel, to not offer any assistance at all.  Then I asked her about the feature in Kakao Taxi app which would require a local Korean number, if that might help in getting a taxi, and if she can help me with that, her response is the same and it seems that she is not willing to help at all. She suggested that I should just wait outside the hotel and flag a taxi... at that point it was getting to be on my nerves at how unhelpful she is. So I shrugged this off. The following day, I asked again about the fastest way to get to Gangnam and again, there was no good answer except that I should just call a taxi on my own.   It is really quite surprising that the great hotel from Marriott would deliver such appalling service. It made me more than a little bit disapppointed considering that the hotel has such high standards in everything else.   Would appreciate if the receptionists are better trained to handle similar concerns like mine and I'm sure there would be other guests who would need the same help.",1
18861,We occupied 2 rooms both were clean and warm . The cost of the 2 rooms were modest compared with other hotels   We were well looked after a call resulted in someone bringing more towels coffee etc .The room size is adequate.,1
59800,"Curt reception staff, tables not cleared in the restaurant at Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner not enough staff and management just standing around watching the chaos. Some food labelled although not a lot. I have a nut allergy so could only eat what I hoped was pretty sure nut free.  Had to go to the pool bar to get your own drink waiters too busy talking. Indoor pool advertised - closed! Booked the hotel as it was Adults only to find children staying in the hotel.  Opus A La Carte restaurant very poor menu selection if All Inclusive There were no spoons often for the soup, while you stood waiting the soup got even colder. When they eventually came they often only bought two spoons. Also the large plates ran out for the main course. It was quite entertaining in a sad sort of way, watching people wandering around trying to find salt & pepper pots. They were very few & far between, if you left unattended you lost them.  Spent the first two or three days depressed in shock discussing awfulness of it all with British guests. When we booked the holiday on 13.1.19, the reviews were pretty good across the board. Don’t know what happened as from Aug 2019 the reviews were diabolical. This was not the best start to a holiday, if I had wanted to feel stressed & depressed I would have stopped at home for free.  The few people in the hotel who were up to scratch were the cleaners. Our room & the toilets were all kept beautifully clean, shame the rest of the staff didn’t shape up. ",1
42420,"I've stayed at the hotel with 3 others. We booked 2 rooms for a total of 5 nights. Checked in twice for our stay as we checked out for a day when we travelled to Hakone.  During the first check in we noticed that one of the rooms was slightly smaller than the other. But the difference wasnt great and we understand it's normal for the size of the rooms to be a little different so it didn't bother us. However, on our second check-in we were rather puzzled when we were given significantly smaller rooms. (We had booked the same room type for all 5 nights) From a rather spacious room where we can open two big luggage and still have walking space to a room where we can only open one luggage with not much walking space. When we checked with the reception we realised that the range in room sizes for the same room type was rather big. If one is lucky they would get the bigger room which we got for our first check in. In the end we decided to pay an extra 1000yen/nights to upgrade our rooms. The amount of space we got for tt extra 1000 yen was rather significant. The room was spacious and one could open 4 big luggages and still have a lot of space. The large room was definitely worth it. But we did prefer the rooms we got for our first check-in as the sink was not in the bathroom, this reduces washing up time as one could use the bathroom while the other wash up at the sink. I had made this reservation through booking.com. Not sure if that is why there is such a significant difference in room size for the room we reserved. Perhaps it might be better to book the room through the hotel website where there more details on the different room types.   Besides the odd room sizes, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The location was good. The rooms we stayed in were clean and tidy. Staff were also polite. The complimentary water, tea and coffee were topped up daily. Would definitely return to this hotel if I ever travel to Tokyo again.",1
18601,"You are paying for the location for this hotel. The hotel is in the middle of Ginza, with great access to the shops.   The rooms are quite dated and in need of a makeover. The staff also weren’t as helpful and welcoming as the staff in other hotels we experienced across Japan.  ",1
57363,"Stayed here from 12/3/23 - 19/3/23. Overall the hotel is decent and most of the staff are friendly. There were a few exceptions! Firstly we arrived late evening and were checked into a building that was quite a distance from the main building. Block H…reminded me of the 80’s show ‘Prisoner Cellblock H’😂 Next day the manager Hasan Ali managed to get us decent rooms in the main building. So when you are booking make sure to specify that you will need rooms in the main building. Unfortunately the weather was not good (It rained for 5 of the 7 days we were there!) So most outdoor pools and amenities were closed. This is where I felt that the animation team should have picked up on keeping guests occupied and not bored. However this didn’t happen as for the first 2 days we didn’t even know who the animation team were! Eventually we managed to figure things out for ourselves and did one or two activities, even though the animation girl called Gulben could not have been more disinterested of she tried! I found her to be rude and aggressive during archery, so I walked away rather than have an ugly confrontation. The other girl called Merva was much better but unfortunately didn’t speak any English. This was a theme in the hotel where some staff did not speak English and literally avoided speaking with us! However the staff that I have to give special mentions to are: Hasan Ali - Reception & Manager. Lovely gentleman who went out of his way to ensure we had a great stay. Hasan - Main waiter in restaurant. Always ensured we had our table and drinks at breakfast. Halil - waiter in restaurant. Always had our table and drinks ready at meal times. Ermik - Barman and waiter. Lovely friendly chap who always served us with a glowing smile and was very courteous, The all inclusive food was more or less the same every day. This could do with improvements. Don’t get me wrong, the food was of a good quality but it gets very boring having the same options daily. The guests in the hotel were mainly German of Russian. The Germans were a lovely friendly bunch but the Russians were quite rude and arrogant. This is a hotel geared towards sports, and there were a lot of German and Russian football and rugby teams staying here. In an evening they would get rowdy as they would drink like crazy and be well plastered before 11pm! There were some good shows on in the evening provided by the animation team. We particularly enjoyed the Madonna show and the Michael Jackson show. After the shows there was the usual live music which was decent. A mix of Western pop songs and some Turkish folk songs. There is nothing in the way of shops or restaurants or bars outside the hotel and you have to go into Belek town centre for any of this. The town centre is about 20min walk down a fairly straightforward road. It is very very expensive and sells a lot of fakes! So not worth bothering with unless you are after that kind of thing. So overall I would give this hotel a 3 out of 5. Good, clean hotel but could do with improvements to attitudes towards English speaking guests. Animation team needs to improve interactions with guests from England. Would I stay here again? I would have to say not as for the same kind of budget, the resorts in Side are much better. In particular the Pegasos Splash World in Side is absolutely superb!",1
6669,"YOU COULD DO WAY WORSE THAN STAYING AT THE CAMBRIDGE....  Lady Eldo and I have stayed at several Sydney hotels in this range in recent years – this is one of the better with service, rooms, facilities and location better than the average. We were also impressed with speed of check-in/out, the quality toiletries and other inclusions and the general lack of noise which we have found is a problem for inner city properties.  The one demerit I could think of is that the pool is kinda small – abt 9mx3m. It has a separate shallow shelf for kids and a spa to the side. No worries, it was closed for repairs, although reception said they could organise a complementary visit to a nearby pool – nada: a bit cold to be walking the streets with damp hair.  Note too the hotel no longer runs a gym – but gave me a complementary pass to a fantastically spacious and well equipped commercial gym no more than 5 minutes walk.  TIPS – this is a good area on the CBD fringe no more than 17mins walk from city central (TOWN HALL), and closer to railway stations (MUSEUM STATION’ = 9min walk), and CHINA TOWN (17min). Major bus routes run along nearby (4 min) OXFORD ST (most start at CIRCULAR QUAY or CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION and go thru to the beaches or WATSONS BAY near the harbour exit). The ferries at CIRCULAR QUAY or DARLING HARBOUR (both 30mins) are a fair walk but the former is say10 mins in a bus or train. The nearest tourist attraction is the ANZAC WAR MEMORIAL (9min walk). - the area has a host of eats joints covering all budgets incl. the nearby OXFORD VILLAGE mall’s (4mins) several inexpensive sit-down places. But note I had a look at the hotel’s own dining room – it was packed with a boisterous crowd (didn’t seem just hotel guests) on a slow Wednesday night, which suggests it might be a local must-go (I didn’t on account I’m a dedicated cheapskate – the cheap and cheerfuls at OV are more my scene) - OXFORD VILLAGE has a good variety of other businesses -  a bottle shop, that good gym, hairdressers, an ALDI supermarket and several others. Well worth a visit. - OXFORD ST is a bit of an entertainment precinct after dark.",1
50619,"Stayed here for 8 nights for our family of 4. Great location. Literally less than 20 steps to reach Myeongdong station exit 2, where a number of tours will gather. They upgrade us to the blue corner room which oversea Namsan Towel.Hotel room size is ok for us with 3 big luggages.  Pros:  -Near Myeongdong market, Daiso beside the hotel, uniqlo opp the hotel -Near day tour meet up place -alot of eating options nearby  Cons: -bring your own toothbrush -tried the hotel breakfast once. Too expensive and the assortment is not alot. Better to venture outside for other food option.  There seems to be another Prince Hotel as a Taxi driver brought us there. Be careful when telling the taxi drive the location.  Overall a rather fuss free stay. Will consider staying here again next time.",1
9850,This hotel is a refurbished Ottomans palace ... Has a history too .. A boutique hotel   It is on the Bosphorus bank directly .. The hotel is safe and secure too.. Has a good wifi and free   The room are in good size .. And also has different rooms ... I think has 14 rooms only.. The receptionist is a nice person called Eflaton .. Very kind and he can speak English too which is good.   I had small issue with the hotel the AC system is not sufficient and not cold especially when you are next to water ... There are no elevator ( or I didn't see one )   I had to check out from it because I couldn't stay in it because of the hot weather and AC not working properly.   I recommend this hotel in winter not in summer ...,1
53483,Seems ok an location is good. Close to 24 hour restaurants etc. The service needs impovement.  The rooms hould be serviced daily and items nees to be stocked up fully.  We had to keep asking for items multiple times. The location of executive studio had very little view. Located in the corner. Had requested for higher floor with view but got lowest floor and no view. Am a member of Ascot Hotel and booked with ASR. Messy booking system.  Staff welcome is very average.,1
29654,"Location, lovely. Moorea is a wonderful island but money grabs ahold and morphs into an equation that gets repeated all over the world. It’s for people who sit by a pool and say they went to French Polynesian. It’s not me and so it was ultimately disappointing. The restaurant relies on you not wanting to leave. Service is mediocre and the food uninspired. Everywhere else we have been, the local people love what they do and are proud. Here they were going through the motions.",1
43866,This hotel is well located - 15 mins walk to the centre of Milan.  Very helpful staff - concierge and reception Modern design; rather characterless  Standard rooms are small; basic finish. Bed quite soft... Breakfast 3/10,1
50158,I stayed with 3 of my girls in one DOM . Double dacker bed without toilet but the toilet just right next to our room. The only part that annoy me alot is when ever someone using the toilet/showerroom we can hear the sound and its annoying when someone shouting and having fun with friends inside the toilet at 2am its very loud and annoying. Well this is what you get with that afforable price.  When we get into that room the floor is sticky i think their cleaner over put their detergent on the floor. Overrall service is good but is not a mandarin speaking hotel as the staff cant speak mandarin only fluent in english which is good enough for us. Nearby hotel there is 3 7E11 and near Neon Night Market. Walking distance to massage place too but its kinda dark near by the hotel as that place still under development. We used phone's light to walk back to hotel during night time . So far im happy with their service so i might go back to this hotel but to book room with toilet and stay away from their public toilet/showerroom .,1

No apologies, no smile, no welcome in fact the check in girl made you feel a nuisance for being there!!!  Hotel has really gone downhill.  No more buffet and NO ROOM SERVICE OF ANY KIND.  Room grubby and very tired.  Everything overpriced.  We've stayed at this hotel many times over the years but NEVER again!   ",1

65157,"I stayed here for a weekend in August 2017 on a last minute cheap deal as I had Eurostar tickets and a ticket to see PSG. I've stayed in a number of hotels in the 8th as it's close to our office. The Cervantes represents great value for money and is a worthy 3 star. I've stayed in worse 4 star. It's conveniently located for St Lazare, Europe, Rome and Place de Clichy metro stops and is well served by the bus. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and the area feels safe late at night considering it's proximity to the red light district. It's sits on a quiet street and my inward facing room meant that the train noise from didn't bother me. The room was clean and comfortable although the bathroom was tiny. Not that much of an issue. The aircon was good and quiet. Breakfast was fine and there was plenty of it. The Wifi was also good. The free Nespresso machine in the lobby was welcome and the staff were friendly. I'm actually booking a weekend in May here on the strength of my previous experience.",1
49671,Next to hyundai outlets. 5mins walk to dongdaemun culture station. Isaac toast take away is nearby. Room size is not too big but able to open 2 large luggage. Not too many restaurants nearby.

65927,"I wanted to love it..   The pillows were so thin and uncomfortable. Of all the five there was only one semi-decent one. I asked for a new set as these were thin and flat, worn-out and after about 30 minutes a staff member delivered one pillow.   It’s hard to give a good review for a hotel when you didn’t  sleep well for two nights. It’s a shame because the bed is very comfortable and you can tell the thread count of the sheets is high so to have such awful pillows is thoughtless.   The location is very central, although 6th street (which is right next to the hotel) had a lot of homeless population.   The overall look of the hotel is very old-school, classic.  Room (1 king bed) was rather small but okay for a couple.   I’d consider lower priced options for your stay or bring your own pillows..",1
13180,"We were advised this was a 5 star hotel but this is far from that. The reception may be that but not the rooms. Old, dated and small but the staff were friendly and accommodating. Very overpriced for what you get. Shop around.",1
44866,I have stayed at this hotel many times and love the location and the rooms but sadly on my last visit I was confronted verbally and physically by an extremely rude and angry manager who proceeded to vent his anger on not only me but other clients who were tying to check in. What I witnessed was unlike any other treatment I have ever seen on this poor couple who were simply trying to get a room. They were allocated the wrong room and politely requested that the matter be fixed and the young girl in reception did not know how to do this so she requested that the manager and man name TON. When Ton came out to deal with the customer he clearly was angry before he even spoke to the customers. His tone and demeanor suggested that something had happened out the back because he was angry before he even started talking to the customers. The end result was that the couple ended up leaving the hotel with the wife in tears. There were several English gentleman along with me who confronted him about his behaviour but he was also rude to us as well. It is such a shame as I like the hotel but will never set foot in there again after witnessing this rude act.,1
6217,"I’ve stayed at this hotel twice before and had great experiences both times. I was expecting the same experience on my third stay, but was very disappointed. Perhaps the hotel is under new management. The room was about the size of a walk-in closet and should have been half the price of the others I’ve stayed in. The HVAV system, the hallway activity, and the street noise kept me awake. The bed did not seem freshly made and the linens were of poor quality. The hair dryer didn’t work and I had to search for a housekeeper to get another one. The restaurant on the first floor does not begin serving until 11:00 am, so there’s no chance of getting an early breakfast without leaving the hotel. I would not stay here again. There are too many better options for a lot less money.  ",1
54537,"you can cook in the room and there is a supermarket open 24hr nearby the hotel.The staff could speak English fluently. A great place for foreigners .Besides the price is appropriate in Tokyo city. Not so far from the subway station. Thus, in my opionion It's worth it to stay here.",1
10544,"As noted by my profile, I am a budget travler and do not expect luxury, but I do expect cleanliness, safety and basics.  This hotel, in my opinion, was lacking some basics. In particular, a refrigerator in the room. Normally I get bottled water to refill our own bottles with ice water. Likewise, we could not bring any left overs home because there was no refrigerator.   They also did not  have ice water available in the lobby except for one evening where it was not refilled. We ended up having to buy $2 water from the vending machines until all the vending machines on each floor ran out of water.  The room is also very small. The one bed is up against the air conditioner.  There were also some cosmestic issues- areas in the bathroom that needed to be repainted and a towel holder on the back of the door falling off In general, it was one of the more expensive hotels I have stayed in and also one of the most disappointing.  The pros? Location- near public transportation- both the Metra and L. Also near museums and walkable to multiple locations. ",1
32558,"The overall experience with our stay was OK.  Hotel staff very friendly and serviceable.  Unfortunately the service of the front desk is lousy.  I made my reservation through the hotel website, in the front desk, when I checked in, they overcharged me.  A month later, when my credit card report arrived, they made me another charge out of nowhere.  I wrote twice to the e-mail they sent me to try to receive at least an explanation for the charges...so far no response.  With the good staff attention and the niceness of the hotel, the threw it all away with the front desk service.  The only explanation I have is front desk people overcharge you on purpose.  Would not visit this hotel again, even though I like it.",1
31072,"This was my 2nd time to stay here and this time I paid extra to have a view of the Eiffel tower, however when I arrived they told me that they only room they had left was on the 5th floor with a pool view.  They wouldn't refund me the extra money I paid for the room, but instead tried to upsell me on a suite.  The $50 resort fee PER DAY is also quite expensive for what little you get -- the gym doesn't open until 7am and you are not allowed to use the steam in the spa, which most other hotels do.  Cocktails were around $25 each in Vanderpump -- quite an expensive place.  Trying to get a chair or service at the pool was very difficult. Plus the whole resort atmosphere is very loud.",1
58786,"The Vincci Resort is one of these huge hotels that cater primarily to organised groups and tours. It is large, impersonal and very average. The rooms are disappointing and cheaply furnished. They have no WiFi; they have no fridge; they have no kettle. There is a safety deposit box in the room but you have to pay to use it.  There is a very wide selection of food in the gigantic restaurant but none of it is really good.   The outdoor pool area is pleasant. If you are a large family looking for a holiday full of activities planning to spend little time in the hotel, it may be a good fit for you. But if you're going to relax in pleasant surroundings, you'd be better off elsewhere.",1
55928,"I've never been one to post reviews, but after being scammed by one of its own staff members, I know feel compelled in this case. The hotel reeks of cigarette smoke, I understand that its legal to smoke indoors here, but people were smoking in the undesignated areas. You'll be asked to pay a tax on arrival at the desk for 75 dinar (£20). The TV channels are locked so they charge 10 dinar for the remote and it's 10 - 50 dinar If you loose your bracelet or key card. You'll probably be approached by your rep offering you excursions on the first morning of your stay and a guy wearing glasses and white overalls overing you a spa deal. These are all legit as we went on the camel ride and the spa session which was cheap and very good. The camel rides were great, the camels appeared in good health (no baldness or cuts to there legs). Its not in a desert tho, its a track on a waste ground used often by fly tippers. The spa deal was half price but we didn't seem to be in there very long, so we believe we were only in half the time THE SCAM.... I must urge you to be aware of a man named Walid or Wahid that will approach you on your first morning of your stay as well, offering you a service at 70 dinar, where he will take you around the mosque and markets of old medina, keeping you safe from scammers and criminal activities in the town. Infact Walid is the scammer, and after picking you up in a old Peugeot 206 with his mate, (look out for his one liners, 'luvly jubbly', 'cheap as chips' and 'asda price', funny until later!). He'll take you to the mosque and appear as a genuine tour guide before trying to lure you into the back of a carpet shop, where an aggressive hard sales pitch is put in front of you by the shop staff, making it impossible to leave without offending them until you agree to buy, (trust me i tried to get out of this in my more detailed review called carept scam linked to hotel) then be promptly marched to a cash point to buy carpets at a maximum value that the local cash machine will allow you draw from, which seems to be  £300 ( 1,100 dinar roughly) after looking at other similiar scams. When you arrive back at the hotel he'll demand an extra 50 dinar as a tip. This incident ruined our holiday, as we had never felt so scared and intimidated on any other holiday we have been on. And totally severed our trust with anyone else working in the hotel. The worrying thing is, is he seems to have an agreement with the hotel to allow this to happen, as he is seen hanging around, chatting to door and reception staff every day. I wouldn't trust your holiday rep either. As it was a guy named issam from Love Holidays ( real rep who knows??) that put it into my head of all the dangers outside the hotel, which paved the way for Walid to step in straight after. There obviously in cohoots, these pair. Another man, named Ahmed but called himself Ali BaBa , wore a white polo shirt and organises the travel for guests to the camel rides and harbour for the pirate ship. He seems to have an agreement with the taxi company. He seemed concerned when I told him about Wahid, but was a mistake on my part as he told Wahid straight away. This prompting Wahid to abruptly follow me till he caught up with me and angrily made me sign a letter that wavered him of any wrong doing. To make sure my impending complaint to Love Holidays would be invalid. When Ahmed would talk to me and my wife, he would always reference his liking for English people, and stated how much he hated the Russians or 'ruski' as he called them. It just made me think what he was saying to the Russian guests about English people. The bar staff were very nice at first but there niceness dwindled after 3 days of not giving them a tip. When tips where issued they'd shout you from afar asking what you'd like, with more table service and bigger glasses. I didn't mind tipping all the bar staff as they are so poorly paid. The restaurant was basic as can be for mid March. My wife is fussy at most times, so she just lived off pan cakes and toast at breakfast and salads during the day. Luckily there's a Papa John's and KFC down the road. I do like trying new foods and local dishes but even I found a lack of choice for Europeans. No fries or ice cream at all! There was just one working coffee machine as well in the restaurant which always caused a never ending que, and none of the juice machines worked. The room cleaning staff were very good but stingy with the toilet paper, as i had to keep asking until I eventually just helped myself from the trolley. There was sick in the hallway near the lift, and wasn't cleaned up for 2 days. The WiFi is very good as we could stream on Netflix in our hotel, hopefully the signal is still as strong when it's more congested during High season. I witnessed one of the locals grabbing hold of an old European lady on the beach, I thought he was joking at first. Her partner tried to step in but got pushed away by him. I started to rush over but he walked away laughing to himseld. The beach watchman didn't do a thing.  Obviously all the usual scams are taking place down the road, ie 'I work as a chef in your hotel, I'd like to take you to my brothers shop for good price, special price'. But to have been scammed by a man associated with the hotel acting to keep you away from scammers is the worst you could possibly imagine. I'd say this is a 4 star hotel at a push. 3 during low season.",1
62211,This hotel was a chock for me. It’s dirty and there is black mold in the shower so you cant even feel clean after a shower. There was also mold on the walls. Please see pictures. Allowing visitors in such room should not be allowed. This is a health risk.,1
62559,"Had another 3 day stop in london on my way home back to australia. Once again i was looking fora place in Fulham. I posted for another Pub hotel stay after my last stop at the Malt House.  The manager was helpful and shoed me to my room, Very nice room, looks new and was very comfy. Bed was good and the desk was large and internet fast, I had a lot of work to catch up on after being in Italy with no WIFI. Google maps clocks this place as 11-18min walk to fulham broadway, it also takes you the long way around i think. found a few back street options off the North road.  They didn't offer breakfast, they did offer a 10% discount at a place 5min away. i walked passed it one day and it didn't look very inviting. Went to shot in Fulham instead.  Check out was a little annoying. My flight wasn't till 930 pm i wanted to leave bags at the hotel somewhere and grab them later in the day. Unfortunately check out is at 1030am and no-one is actually on site till 12pm.  i was told if packed a bag of things i needed for the next day i could i leave my bag in the bar over night and and collect it next day when i was ready. This wasn't very convenient. i ended up taking my bag to paddington station and leaving in there locker system for 12 pounds for the day, that would i could just jump on the heathow express and not worry about the tube traffic. That and breakfast probably the only 2 minor problems i had at the captain cook. other wise its a great place stay. Bus stops out the front too which head in every direction.",1
13458,The superior room is clean but small.  The street noise from the construction being done facing our hotel is unbearable. It starts at 9am until 5pm. We have to use earplugs not be disturbed in the morning and afternoon. The air conditioner is written in Dutch and cannot be set more than 20 degree Celsius. It is too cold. The director dismissed our complaints.  The room was booked 3 months ago. Why were we not given a room at the top floor knowing that there would be construction? If you want peace and quiet do not take rooms facing the streets… it is a nightmare.,1
48132,"We paid 270 per night for a very small room, with a very noisy airconditioner. The service was medium, the room very basic and the location far from the center. Not a nice choice.  The reception personnel not very professional neither polite. At 19.00hrs they told us that the room was not ready!!!!",1

As well if I told you that coffee is freeze dried coffee packets.

11636,"For a 'capsule hotel' The Millennials Shibuya is quite good - the beds are bigger than a capsule you'd find elsewhere and there's good space for storage under the beds. The location was great, within short walking distance of Hachiko entrance/exit of Shibuya station, and close to loads of shops and restaurants.  That's about all I can say this place has going for it though. I booked in for 10 days and I'm currently preparing to move elsewhere at day 7. In summary, my main issue has been with the other guests in the hotel, but I also had issues with the hotel itself. Yes, in booking a capsule hotel, you should be prepared for little privacy or quiet - but I don't believe this place is worth the price they charge.  The pods/rooms don't have any soundproofing whatsoever - you may as well be staying in a dorm room with a curtain in front of your bed. Two ladies staying in pods directly across from me would make multiple speakerphone calls to home each day, sometimes late at night, and were not trying to be quiet at all. The cleaners come through from 10AM and seem to spend about 2 hours on each floor.  The 'happy hour' with free beer from 5:30-6:30 PM is nice if you want that kind of thing, but this is done in the kitchen/dining area. On the days where I just wanted to eat my dinner in peace, it got very noisy and some of the loud conversations I would overhear were vulgar and inappropriate. Would have been nice to have a separate area for this sort of thing.  There's only one lift and it's not very big, so if you're trying to move luggage in or out at peak times, good luck. The staff I encountered seemed to have a bit of an attitude - similar to what I'd expect from teenage retail workers. I wasn't shown where the ice maker was or how to use the coffee machine, and no one seemed particularly approachable.  For a stay of a few nights this place is more than fine, but any longer and it really starts to feel claustrophobic and quality of sleep is pretty low.",1
37855,"This is not 4 star , also the room does not worth the amount I paid.   Breakfast re filling they stop at 9:30 and when we asked their attitude were  very rude . Overall not a pleasant stay  Location is good , pool is good",1
59217,"Located near Monumentale, the hotel is new and very well design.  Room are almost perfect and hotel's bar & restaurants speechless.  Unfortunatelly, the service is not in line:   - Concierge/Guest relation was trying hard but end-up giving us bad advises and adresses for dining. They were also unable to book us tickets to an exhibition as they required our credit card to do: charging our room was not an option proposed!  - At the ground floor restaurant, we took an order that didn't come after 40 minutes: the waitress explained to us that staff in the kitchen gave our order back and forth to each other and end-up that nobody took in charge of it!!! We cancelled our order as they request us to wait for 10 to 15min more..  So in 2 days stay: that was enough i guess..  Hopefully, management will fix that problems to be at the level that international standard required.",1
61840,"I'm writing this review from my room before I depart early because wow. I highly recommend staying somewhere else.  I stood in line respectfully waiting for my turn and they spoke to everyone else (including staff) for quite a while. One of them even picked up a phone when I clearly had been waiting to be helped. Another was doing absolutely nothing the entire time I stood at the desk, she never acknowledged me or even looked up. 5 people at the desk and no one could help me? Odd.   When I finally was helped, I asked to extend and the person told me yes but that it would come with a fee. Totally fine. Then, another person quite rudely tells her own associate I cannot extend because they had 10 rooms left to sell. I mean, really? When I was willing to pay extra and you have available rooms? Her associate even apologized to me behind the rude woman's back, unreal.  There is no shampoo or conditioner so, make sure to bring your own. Toilet paper is super thin so, you may want to bring that as well. The shower had rust stains and I had to wipe a hair away with one of the towels.  There is a tea kettle in the room which is nice but, no water. If you try to use the tap water, the kettle does not fit. I'm used to hotels with at least one bottle of water in the room. However, there are vending machines on each floor so, I ended up doing that.  If I have to mention anything positive, it would be location. It's central to Temple bar and the shopping. So, if you like cleaning your shower, don't plan on spending any time in the room or speaking to the staff, it may be convenient for you.  The industry is called hospitality but there is none to find in this place. They clearly do not need your money, best to spend it somewhere else. ",1
55458,"I wrote this letter of complaint to the hotel 3 weeks to give them the opportunity of reply - but no reply:  Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about our stay at one of your hotels.  My wife and I were very upset and disappointed by the whole experience.  We stayed at the Best San Francisco Hotel in Salou from the 13th May 2017 until 23rd May 2017.  The tone was set as soon as we arrived.  We were informed that there was a charge for the safety deposit boxes in the room.  This is not mentioned on your website, it states that the boxes are optional.  I think it is incredibly underhand to avoid mentioning that it is chargeable.  Then I discovered that it wasn’t a nominal charge – it cost €45 for a 10 day stay which I find absolutely outrageous.  For many families on a budget, that is a very large charge.  I believe that a safety deposit box is an absolute must and checked that you offer them – if you had not then I would not have booked your hotel.  I have never been charged for the use of a safety deposit box in any other hotel – only a deposit.  I had no choice but to pay the fee and then go to the room.  The room was very hot so I tried to turn on the air conditioning but there was no remote control, so I went back down to reception to ask where it was.  I was then advised that the air conditioning is not available until June.  I was amazed.  I had specifically checked the website to ensure that we would have air conditioning before booking.  After re-checking the website, it does indeed say that the rooms are air conditioned.  It does NOT say that it is unavailable in May.  This must be contrary to Trading Standards and is morally wrong.  After a very poor noisy first night’s sleep we were then in a dilemma about how to sleep.  We had 2 choices: 1.	Sleep with the patio door closed to keep the noise out – this meant that we were unable to sleep because the room was so hot 2.	Sleep with the patio door open – this meant that we were kept awake most of the night with the noise from people outside and later from delivery trucks and traffic in the early morning.  I had the worst 10 night’s sleep I have had on any previous holidays.  Your website is wrong and should be changed.  Nevertheless, we tried to make the best of it and spent as much time away from the hotel as possible.  However the staff in the hotel did not help.  They were all so unhappy.  I can only assume that the ‘Best’ chain of hotels is not the best place for employment.  I think I saw 1 smile in 10 days.  This has been one of the most disappointing holidays and I would welcome your responses to my comments before I leave my review on Tripadvisor.   Thanks David Baxter",1

66735,"Clean and nice, but: - temperature too high in the room (brought it manually to 18, but didn’t work) - one towel per person is unacceptable.

67562,"Stayed at the Royal Hotel Seoul in mid December and January which was very cold. The airport shuttle arrived on time to pick us up and drove all the way in front of the hotel. The check in was very smooth and timely. This hotel is literally the centre of Myeongdong, was very easy to shop for hours and let us run back due to -20 degree temperature.. Although the train station is 7mins away, taxi cabs on right in front of the hotel while they have frequent shuttles that go to Seoul Station. This was a good service as it made it easier to plan our trip to Busan. This would definitely be the hotel to choose when staying in Seoul, I am extremely happy to be coming in next week to this hotel again! ",1

Staff was useless in helping us with the issues. Encountered Sabrina at the bar by the pool, 100 % unprofessional and very disrespectful to us. I think the fee’s this location charge are completely a rip off as well. Parking at night was joke. We should have heeded the warning so many others have given and stayed elsewhere.  This experience will make us rethink our decision when choosing an IHG property again.  We may even try to complain to IHG, not for compensation but for piece of mind.",1
30496,"My initial experience in my first three nights in Pullman was positive. I booked a deluxe room. Check-in, room, and general service were ok.  But then I tried to extend my stay by two days. The receptionist Mr. Ilham informed me that deluxe rooms are not available but I could book a superior room which is more expensive (250USD) per night. I asked Mr. Ilham whether I could pay for the more expensive superior room but could stay in the deluxe room where I was staying to prevent me to pack and move rooms. Mr. Ilham - entirely incompetent - informed me that this is not possible (his boss Mrs. Meiske informed me later that this would actually be no issue and could have been done). I asked several times Mr. Ilham whether I could speak with his boss in this matter but Mr. Ilham refused to contact his boss as she would be busy.   The booking process for the extension of my stay took around one hour although I agreed to move rooms. Mr. Ilham was constantly typing something and I had to stand and wait beside him. No clue what actually he did.   When I insisted after 40 minutes to finally see his boss he went to get her and Mrs. Meiske apologized for the incompetence of her colleague but did not shortcut the procedure which after she was called still took 20 minutes.   The preparation of tax invoices with my company name, address, and tax id was further a disaster. As I needed two (initial stay and extension) the receptionist needed for each four attempts before my company information was properly populated. Also for this, I had to stay beside this guy.   The room I then got is shown in the picture below. That is what you get for 250 USD as a superior room in Pullman Thamrin. Besides this, the internet was not working and the sockets were defective that I was not able to work. It took several hours to get this fixed.   In summary: Extremely poor customer experience and the room is a disaster. For 250 USD per night one can just expect more.",1

Check in time was 4:00, we showed up at 3:00 and the front desk told us the rooms were ready, but because we were one hour early, there was a $56 fee. Came back at 4:00 and there was a huge line up, finally check in at 5:45. Informed the front desk that l paid for a full day, not for a 6 hour period...she barked back in such a rude manner.  The room was dirty with 2 dead moths near the window. Both bed light fixtures were broken. The safe was locked and the wall fixtures were covered in dust.  The bed boxes were both in rough shape.  4 days later, after having complained, the safe was still locked, both dead moths were still on the floor and the light fixtures were not fixed.",1
49974,"The positives: we appreciated the location - away from Thera but with some nice bars and restaurants just a few minutes walk south along the coatal path. We also enjoyed breakfast which was well put together.  The staff were very friendly though did not seem well trained to help with anything other than a positive enquiry.  The cleaning standards were acceptable, though not great - a pizza crust and plastic cup were thrown onto our terrace one evening from above and were not removed as part of general cleaning.  The disappointments: this hotel (based on room 6 which is sold as a ""Superior Double"") is dated and in major need of renovation, particularly the bathroom. The shower is not big to start with however the shower curtain does nothing to control the shower water (partly because it is too short) and therefore the room is flooded with each shower. The shower head also falls of each time the tap is switched from shower mode back to tap. The door to the bathroom is glass and as there is no shutter or blind on the bathroom window, you cannot keep light out and the bedroom starts to get light from 5AM onwards, with no way to block it out. The staff kindly taped up a bin liner which helped, though not exactly nice for a ""Superior"" room. The room was also in a generally poor state of repair, with a bundle of exposed wires hanging out one corner, the fuse box door hanging off and the terrace parasol broken.  The room also had its original wooden (singled glazed) doors, windows and shutters, which looked cute but offered no noise insulation at all. Our room was underneath a general terrace area therefore every time someone dragged a chair the sound vibrated into our room. The general terrace also overlooked the room terrace, so this along with being next to the reception meant the room and terrace were not very relaxing places to be, and often did not feel as private as they should.  I did discuss my disappointments with the staff during our stay and the staff did what they could (for example, see above re bin liner) however to be fair to them these are issues that are not easily resolved and there was no dissatisfaction with them personally.  However regarding hotel management, they are not onsite and I was advised they work remotely (how you can manage a hotel without being there I am not sure). It certainly felt they were not supportive of their staff. I was promised a manager would get in touch a number of times however I have now departed and am still awaiting to hear from them, despite following up myself while at the hotel. It will be interesting to see if they reply in a public domain even though they had the opportunity to do so in person.   We did request to leave early and for unused nights to be refunded which was eventually agreed by the never-present manager, along with a refund for one further night.  On a general note, the bed was one of the hardest I have experienced (I use a lot of hotels due to work), but would not mention this as a negative as I understand this can be personal preference.  Also, for any sunset hunters, you will not see it from this room terrace as you are too far around the caldera. Not an issue for ourselves but worth noting for anyone that thinks they may see it from the position of the hotel.  There is also no staff coverage after about 11PM therefore if you have any security issues or problems with inconsiderate residents then there is no one onsite to support.  Out of five different hotels we stayed at during 3 weeks in Greece (including Mykonos) this was the most expensive per night, however was by far the lowest quality accomodation.  Therefore I would recommend either resetting your expectations of what you may be hoping for from a ""Superior"" room at the Nefeli or consider one of the many, higher quality alternatives in the area.",1
61254,"Stayed at this hotel for the second time over three months. While the first time everything was fine, this time regretfully the service provided was inconsistent. Got a room upgrade due to the loyalty program status for which thanks. Interaction with the reception staff was definitely nice, however some other departments such as room service left a lot to be desired. On departure day, ordered some breakfast as I had an early flight. After 45 minutes, still no news until someone called me to ask me if my order had been delivered. I informed it was not the case and that I probably would have no time anymore as I needed to check out soon. There was not even any sign or any word of apology, instead the person on the phone did even sound like he was finding this situation amusing. I personally do not find it amusing to experience such discomfort. In view of the very high room rates they charge, they could at least have some customer-oriented attitude. Needless to say there are more than enough other hotels in Singapore for a next visit, obviously the lesson learnt is that loyalty does not mean anything.",1
57832,"For those looking for an alternative place to stay in NYC which is not a hotel, Mont Morris is highly recommended. The place we stayed at is in a typical New York residential house, in a residential neighborhood outside Downtown NYC but near to Central Park. The room we got is a themed room (old world style) using shades of red, pink and orange. The room came with a comfortable bed, small sofa set, coffee table, some ornate drawers for storage, wooden floors and an ensuite toilet+shower. Lighting-wise, the room is dimly-lit which I think is in accordance to the  room theme, but I feel it is too dark for my liking. Our host provided us with a quite extensive guide to visiting places of interest in New York, as per a local New Yorker's experience. Out host (Paola) was responsive and accomodating to our small requests (e.g. flat iron). Overall, a reasonably-priced and spacious place if you don't mind staying in the Manhattan Uptown area.  A side note- I noticed it is called a ""bed and breakfast place"" here in Tripadvisor, but they don't really serve breakfast (at least they didn't serve any during our stay). Also, the bill balance needs to be paid in cash.",1
15011,"First the positive-Every staff member we met was courteous.  -They made sure my feather free request was taken care of before we checked in  -The location was convenient and hotel was quiet and clean.   Not so positive -Very tiny room for a 2 queen.  So small the luggage cart could not be brought completely into the room.  -Not enough storage for 2-4 people who are only friends/not related. No real drawers only 3 very small wire baskets so not good for two friends traveling as they are open and see through so don’t really want to put underwear and clothes in them. Had to leave folded clothes clothes in suitcase and then try to store the suitcase. Small items also fell through the large holes in the metal sliding baskets.  -No real nightstand(s) only a tiny single shelf between the two beds and the space was taken up by a clock and a phone. So it was difficult to have two phones, two bottles of water, and keep our purses close by at  -There appeared to be possibly a USB port by the bed to plug in phones but it was broken out.  -Coffee pot and ice bucket were in the bathroom by the toilet-gross!! Not sure why this was the case when there was a counter in the bedroom area.  -Antiquated air conditioner controlled on the unit even though there was a thermostat on the wall so unable to get the room to a comfortable temperature. Also the vent area of the AC was filthy.  -No towel hangers by the bathroom sink so hand towels had to either be left laying on the small vanity or hung on hooks directly over the toilet.  -Wall/baseboard peeling/broken in the bathroom.",1

The Changi airport lounges were all full booked but luckily, the airport staff directed us to Holiday Inn Express in Katong, which was a 10-15 minute cab ride from the airport.   The staff were extremely helpful on the phone, considering it was 1am in the morning and we told them we would be arriving in 20 minutes at their hotel. They checked us in, without fuss and very friendly front desk staff.  Our room was small but had everything we needed to freshen up and have a good nights sleep before our travels the next morning.

49153,"Check in today at Sunrise and decided to pay for an upgrade to the Grand.  Told me room was clean and they would move our stuff over.  Got here and the room wasn’t ready and had to wait an hour.   Finally got to the room and they didn’t give me the room type I paid for and had to wait 3 additional hours for it to be ready.  In the meantime, my 3 year old who had been waiting in the sun all this time had a febrile seizure walking outside.  I picked her up as my other children screamed in horror watching her convulse.  The lifeguards and paramedics came over but spoke absolutely no English and were trying to use google translate to assist.  The paramedic tried to put a towel in my daughters mouth because she was shaking but from training this is absolutely the opposite of what should be done.  I begged for someone to take us out of the sun into some place cold but no one understood and the resort is so big that carrying her was so much slower to get her care.  Ultimately I got a ride but they made me wait for a public relations person to join us.  The first thing they asked me to do was sign a waiver.  Didn’t even wait for my daughter to recover or for my kids  stop crying.    This place is the absolute worst and if you need to count on them in case of an emergency you will be in bad shape.  Hours later I went to speak with a manager as we still weren’t in our room and all I got was an apology.  The first day of the family vacation was gone and the kids scarred and this place could care less.    Give your money to literally anyone else.",1

They have complimentary breakfast every day of bagels with cream cheese, jelly (aka jam in my world!) and peanut butter as well as fresh fruit, juice etc.   My only drawback is that each floor only has 5/6 bathrooms with showers and toilets. This means first thing in the morning it can be difficult to find a bathroom. It would be better if there were a couple of toilets as well as just mini bathrooms with shower and toilet in one.   Incidentally I will be returning for my 7th or 8th stay in a month and cannot wait!",1
42091,"The experience with St Regis ZH was excellent from the moment I started making contact with them. For this trip, I probably required more advanced planning as it was my wife's birthday, so I am glad that the team was so accommodating.   Right after confirming my hotel room reservation, I contacted Iridium Spa to make a reservation. There was no email address available on the website, but they emailed me shortly after I called them to ask for the menu. The reservation was made with little to no hassle.  Then I contacted 2 other teams, the Butler Service and Concierge.  I told the butler service the reason for our trip, and they immediately offered to decorate the room with flowers and balloons. Eva and Elaine from the Butler Service team were very helpful and polite, and upon my arrival, there were rose petals on the bed and bathtub, balloons as agreed, and even a birthday cake for my wife. When I arrived, Elaine came by deliberately to say hi and make sure everything was in order. Eva was unfortunately on leave, so I didn't meet her, but she (and Elaine) prepared a HAND-WRITTEN greeting and birthday card for my wife. There is rarely any business that provides that level of personal touch nowadays. Hats off to Eva and Elaine for doing an excellent job.  As for the concierge, I wanted to contact them to buy a bouquet. They put me in contact with Martin (concierge supervisor) who I communicated with through WeChat. He got an understanding of the type of flowers I wanted, ordered what I wanted from the florist, then confirmed my arrival date and time. When we arrived to the hotel, we went down for lunch, but the flowers had not arrived to the room. So I messaged Martin, who immediately responded and brought the flowers up to my room in person! Again, another amazing level of service.  No hotel is perfect, for example the water was leaking out from under the glass door of the shower room, and the outdoor pool was not open (due to weather), but the service and attitude of the staff more than compensated for any minor problems.   Well done St Regis ZH, and especially thank you to Eva, Elaine and Martin. They are a true asset to the hotel.",1
23431,The hotel itself is relatively new and in decent condition. Location is also very central. The issue is the staff are just not trained to the standards of a 5 star international hotel unfortunately. They are young and enthusiastic but are clearly lacking experience and training. I needed a DHL envelope to be collected for shipping and despite checking 4 times throughout the day it never got sent. I also needed to scan something in the business centre and none of the staff seemed to have any idea how to do it so again the task was never completed. It’s a real shame because the hotel has so much potential and being a regular traveler in the region my experience at 5 star hotels such as those in Dubai are impeccable.  I really hope for the sake of everyone that the management takes this review into account and acts to improve the customer service standards.,1
17409,"I do not recommend the hotel to anyone. We had a reservation by the end of March, but the borders were closed due to the virus, so our trip failed. The accommodation fee deducted last November was not reimbursed despite repeated requests, they promise, but the money is nowhere to be found.",1
5671,"We booked this hotel as a last minute get-away for the family. We had two adults and two teenagers (15 & 16) with us.  We arrived at 2am and the security on the door were more than happy to help with our luggage. We were greeted at reception by a German receptionist. Luckily, I was able to speak a little German so was able to inform her we were English speakers. They had even gone out their way to prepare sandwiches, fruit and cake for us. They gave us the password for the wifi which we were told worked all through the hotel.   The rooms weren't massive; just enough for 2 beds, a dresser and a chair. The bathroom was a little small with the toilet behind the door, but they were ok for the week. We stayed on the seventh floor, the floor which you had to press your phone against the balcony door to get any wifi. I was in room 720 and the views off the balcony was a nice view of the beach and you could see for miles. Rooms were cleaned pretty much everyday and the cleaners were nice and friendly.   The hotel on the whole was pretty good. The majority of the staff were friendly and it was always clean and tidy. There was a decent indoor bar opposite the restaurant which had a pool table but you had to get tokens from the bar. There were very few English speaking people there so if you like to be sociable then this isn't the place for you. The majority of the people there were German or Russian.   The pool was outside the hotel, connected by a bridge. The water was pretty cold but it was clean. The outdoor bar ran all day, serving snacks at lunchtime and ice cream at 3. There was minimal entertainment in the daytime but the 4 entertainers kept the day going and were always keen to get everyone involved. There were 2 slides that went into a separate pool and a smaller one for younger children. There were a few lifeguards around the pool but didn't seem to care what was going on. Inflatables and balls were allowed in the pool. The only downside was the fact that the pool was boltic. It was absolutely freezing!!!   The night entertainment wasn't the best and one of the things that let the hotel down. I really recommend going into town for a few drinks in the evening. There are plenty of places to get drinks and some bars cost 1 lev for a pint (that's 50p). Town is really cheep and there are lots of shops that sell copy/fake items but at a really decent price. There were lots of places to eat out and some places are really generous with their portion sizes. Just down the road from the hotel is a kebab stall which is what we needed after seeing (and tasting) the food in the hotel.  The food wasn't great at all. The meat was uncooked some night and by the time you'd got your dinner/lunch it was cold by the time you sat down. Breakfast wasn't the best so after the first day I'd chosen to lie in and skip breakfast. Lunch was 12-2 and cold chips and raw meat was on the menu everyday. I recommend that you have lunch by the pool and have hotdogs for the pool bar. Tea/dinner was alright but it was the same kind of food everyday. The drinks were juice, tea, coffee, water and milk on tap along with wine. If you wanted beer or fizzy pop then you had to ask a waiter but who knows when it comes.   ",1
42434,Nice and modern renovated rooms. Fresh water bottles every dat. Clean. Excellent location in Shibuya with some nice pubs around the corner (Mikkeller!). Unfortunately very noisey in the weekend caused by the bar at the 1th floor. Even up on the 5th Floor the music was really loud untill 3.30am(!!). Spoiled the stay for us a bit.,1
8339,"Can’t give a better rating based on lack of detail by staff resulting in 3+ hr wait for room on arrival, a 38% tip charged to us for burgers and the wrong drink to my wife who’s sober 20yrs.

66035,"I was granted an early check-in which was appreciated. The staff were friendly and professional. However, the sound proofing of the room was non-existent. Between the noise from adjacent rooms (loud snorer on one side, young children on another) and from the hallway, I barely slept (and I’m not a light sleeper). I would not stay here again based solely on that. The mini bar was not stocked and room service delivered my beer without a bottle opener (because apparently my empty bar fridge was supposed to have one). Not what I would expect from a Fairmont, especially given the nightly rate I paid.",1
56584,"Note: I’m reposting this under my profile, as the earlier one was in response to an email I received from Expedia, which I did not realize would end up here.  I’ve revised and added some photos.  We chose this guest house because we were in town for a conference but also intended to do some sightseeing and exploring. There were things we particularly enjoyed about the guest house:  The international staff:  Butlers—Veronica (Kenya), Abdul Razek (Pakistan) and Nathan (Zimbabwe). All were very kind and service oriented.   Wait staff—Ahmed (Egypt), Samir (Pakistan) and Mary (Cameroon).  The accommodations:  The guest house is an 11 room Emirati home that has been restored. The building—exterior and interior are charming and a peek at an earlier life, at the edge of the Bur Dubai, a historical neighborhood.    It feels like a bed and breakfast.  When the house is not full, the butlers prepared breakfast for us to order; when it was, there was a buffet.  The location:  Adjacent to the Metro, it is also close to the ferry and boats on the Dubai Creek (as well as buses).  Souk Al Kabeer, the textile souk, is a 5-10 minute walk. And my husband reminds me that Carrefour, a well stocked grocery store is nearby.   Photos are from the rooftop and interior courtyard.  ",1
42262,"I rocked up to the breakfast buffet with the intention to pay for breakfast. RMB180 per person is not cheap for China. I asked for the bill be charged to the room. They said it was not possible since the room was booked using points (which is correct).   There was a sign saying Marriott Bonvoy members get 20% off dining. I said I was a member, but the staff said it was only applicable for lunch and dinner (how convenient).   I said I'd pay using Alipay but pls make sure the Marriott bonvoy points are credited to my account. They said I was not able to get points for the breakfast as it's not included in the points system.  Then they said I could get the points as long as I paid cash. I said ""who carries cash in China anymore?""  In the end, after 20 mins of back and forth, they were able to charge Alipay, and credit my account for the breakfast.  Something fishy is happening at this place.  Got to the breakfast at 9, and could only start eating at 9:30 (breakfast concludes at 10:30) so it was not pleasant.   Food selection I'd give it a 5 out of 10. Not the best but enough. And it was CROWDED but it was also a Sunday morning.",1
41169,"An affordable place to stay at a central location. Close to light rail and darling harbour. Metro woolies close by to for snacks which was handy, as well as a 7 eleven.  Tidy room, very spacious. Bed was comfy. Nice big bathroom, and everything in the room seemed modern. Also had coffee facilities at reception area.   Check in was quick, and liked the late check out of 11.am (will keep in mind for next visit).  Down side was noisy guests in the room next door. Could hear everything,  as the parents couldnt keep the kids quiet, upon their return to the room at bout 9pm. Sounded like they let them jump round the room.",1
64640,"Arrived at the inn and was met by a slightly moody and unwelcoming receptionist ( think she was the owners daughter), checked in and was told I had to sign to say I oils to smoke in my room or anywhere on the premises , there was a slight problem with my credit card and someone else came to the rescue, was told once again about the no smoking policy and was then asked if I smoked.  I can’t see what that has to do with a hotelier!  Apart from that room was quite pleasant for the price however there was a slight aroma to the room and it could have down with the wall either washed or re painted !  Overall you get what you pay for , quite a good location 👍",1
9077,"Very quiet. Bed was quite soft but supportive and good quality. I felt that it was a bit too soft for me, but beds are very much of a personal opinion, and at least I woke up after a long, uninterrupted sleep and with no aches and pains. The room is clean and spacious. Staff speak adequate English. Location is good but it's on the periphery of the area containing the main attractions, so some attractions are far away eg the Archaeological Museum, but others are close. My only serious concern is that the rooms need a room safe, and room numbers on the doors! You can't buy bus tickets nearby but the taxis are very cheap (for taxis go L out of the hotel then L again) to avoid the huge flight of steps when you go R out of the hotel.",1

He was a Chinese  young male, very, very unfriendly and really rude! Jacuzzi is cold water and approached staff about it and they said they would never upgrade to warm water. This was the staff looking after the spa, 2 men. This hotel should be rated 2 star, due to unfriendliness of front staff.   Mr Foo Chinese chef very pleasant and the day he was on, always had lots of variety for breakfast. He deserves a medal and pay rise. He deserves recognition for his hard work. Indian lady waitress Karamjeet lovely and pleasant and accommodating at breakfast time. Breakfast was included in our stay and breakfast staff very pleasant. They need to train the front desk in public hospitality.  Front desk need to be trained and educated in dealing with public relations. Manager, shift manager Chinese male in restaurant very pleasant!! He was the head of restaurant, very approachable. And ran the breakfast to a very high standard. We were only there at breakfast time.   Will never return to this poorly unfriendly hotel, extremely disappointed, due to front desk.

44898,"This park hyatt certainly doesn’t live up to its name. When I got off my limo, there was no one to help with luggage and I had to handle myself with the driver. Then when I got to check in, there is no membership lane - first I have seen that after staying at so many hyatt hotels (low to high end). As you know it is still the pandemic time and I was told occupancy is only 60%, then I was allocated to a standard room (not even river view, not to say suite). Throughout my experience, except the “GLOB” signal on the check in form, I nearly forgot I am a loyal hyatt customer.  To be frank, I don’t quite care all these, but I do think having a fast lane for frequent traveler is the basic.   In terms of hardware, you can tell immediately that the door is made of cheap wood and not sound proof. And for bottled water, they only offer very cheap local brand that not ever heard of. It’s not comparable to park hyatt in other Chinese cities shanghai, Guangzhou or shenzhen (not to say Paris and Milan of course)  I can’t say I am not disappointed. But I guess I have no one to blame for trying an adventurous option while the grand hyatt by the WestLake is such a safe option   这家柏悦酒店确实名不副实。当我下了车，竟然没有门童帮忙拿行李，我只好自己和司机搬下车。当我要办理入住手续时，这里竟然（再一次）没有会员专用道——我住过许多凯悦酒店（从低端到高端），第一次看到一家凯悦（更是柏悦）不重视会员。现在还是疫情的时候，我被告知入住率只有60%，然后我被分配到一个标准间（甚至连河景都没有，更不用说套房了）。从check-in开始，除了登记表上的“GLOB”标注，我几乎忘记了我是凯悦的Globalist。坦率地说，我不太在乎这些，但我确实认为为常旅客提供一条快速通道是最基本的。  在硬件方面，你可以马上看出门是用廉价的木头做的，不是隔音的。而对于瓶装水，他们只提供从未听说过的本地品牌。  这家柏悦无法与中国其他城市的柏悦相比，上海、广州或深圳（当然，更不用说巴黎和米兰了）。  我不能说我不失望。下次应该选回西湖旁的君悦酒店 ",1

46488,"It is with great regret that I bring up the poor and shoddy room and service that I have experienced at the Hyde Park Inn Sydney.   I have stayed in hotels in more remote countries where service and the state of the room is better and at a more competitive rate.   I attach an image of the long unsightly window stain which was conveniently covered by the curtains.   From the look of the stain it might have been there for some time but no one had bothered to look or clean carefully.   I further attach an image of the towels which I have left in the morning on the towel rack.  Since I was given the option to leave them to be dried for reuse, I had hung them there. But I was in a rush and didn't hang them well.   When I returned in the night,  to my shock the towels were still left hung in the hurried manner as I had left them.  The least that your staff can do is to help me to fold them back neatly and in presentable manner.  I was told by your duty manager Ashley that the staff will not touch the towels that are hung on the rack...can they not use gloves??  When I informed Ashley of the window stain instead of coming up to check and see for himself he expected me to have the answer for him as to whether the stain was on the inside or outside of the window.   This is not acceptable,as the duty manager it is for him to come up and see for himself.  It is not for him to simply expect the guest to feed him with the information.   Then he told me that he was going to arrange for a staff to hand me a pair of clean towels. Ashley said that I could then inform the same staff as to where the stain is so that they can clean it tomorrow.   When the staff appeared at the door, he looked grumpy and simply handed me the towels.  When I told him that he was also to take a look at the window stain he said that he was not told of that and that Ashley was waiting for him downstairs.   I insisted that he was supposed to come in to check on the stain and he just held out the towels to me and asked me "" Do you want the towels or not?""  When I insisted that he came in he abruptly and grumpily turned away from me and took the towels with him.  If there is a negative work environment, I see it in your hotel. You just throw service out of the window. Your staff saw us entering just now and even when our eyes met there was no reaction, not even a ""hello"" or a smile.   The entire experience is just disappointing and dismal. I will also be uploading my feedback on TripAdvisor as it is fair that other tourists are warned about what to expect here.  ",1
7412,"I’m a business traveller, usually stay in Sydney 5 nights in any given month. My experience at this hotel is disgusting.

The room mini bar fridge is not filled with anything, even a bottle of water.

47473,"Location and view is great. It’s Rosewood. What do we expect? If you have stayed at other Rosewood hotels, please do not expect the same level service.  Service is really mediocre or even worse than some hotels. Some of the staff are rude. I’m Japanese who isn’t so great with Chinese and I understand that I should be speaking Chinese because this is in China but my English is fluent. My wife is German who is also fluent in English. At the 107F “Too high bar”, if you don’t speak Chinese they treat you like you are a dumb person.  They will expect you to speak Chinese because you are an Asian looking.  Also the 95th floor lunge cafe is not available for guests since it’s booked for afternoon tea for people from outside. I was told to go down stairs at 1F and find some cafe to meet my friend who I invited over to catch up.  They didn’t even provide cafe name or location.   I appreciate the hotel facilities and its brand but I really didn’t appreciate the service level they have. I hope the hotel service isn’t racist to their customers in the future. I will definitely stay again. I’ve been enjoying almost all Rosewood hotels in different locations I’ve stayed.",1
55401,"Hotel is clean and modern enough. Plenty of sun loungers around the pool at this time of year and entertainment in the evening(even if it’s too quiet to create an atmosphere and questionable).  They never had more then possibly 5-10 tables filled. We did not opt for eating in the hotel so cannot comment. Unfortunately the two negatives of our stay are as follows. 1) Met by a very rude receptionist (Roma) on arrival. Definitely the most rude experience I have ever encountered from hotel staff in all my years of travelling. We were placed in a room at the back of reception meaning our balcony view was to a brick wall with a few plants. It was on the lower ground floor and adjacent to the pool on the other side was a gritted fence out onto the main road. Also inconveniently placed right behind the entertainment stage. We swiftly returned to him and requested a pool view room as paid for on booking.com. €657 for one week accommodation with no food is pricey enough afterall and the booking did come with a pool view. Roma did not like this and tried to argue that it was a pool view room. This is like trying to argue that an apple is a banana. Not going to work. He reluctantly gave us another room whilst huffing, puffing and acting like a sulking child. It was almost like a comedy show by the end of it. All I could do was laugh. New room was adequate. Rooms match interior and they are modern and clean.  2) unfortunately we could hear everything in our room. I could tell when the neighbours were brushing their teeth or washing there hands based on how long they ran the sink for. I am not a fussy traveller and I sleep well in noise but this was pretty loud. The friendliest member of staff we came across in the hotel was the lifeguard who did his job well and was always smiling. We didn’t talk to him or even require any of his assistance but a smile goes a long way.  The hotel is located close to everything and this was a plus.",1

47471,"This hotel has amazing views but some real patchy service which is really unfortunate. Although some of the staff were nice and attentive, others were obnoxious and there were several moments that really made me feel exasperated or cringe.   Bad experience 1:  I asked the front desk where I could find the nicest views in the hotel to take photos. After all, you’re about 100 floors up. Because the front desk is next to a terrace, the woman merely said there outside. It was a very unhelpful answer because that terrace on all sides is stacked high with greenery I presume as safety measure to ensure people don’t get too close to the edges. You can’t come within one meter of the sides and also the height of the plants blocks the view. You simply can’t get a clear shot.   I pointed that out that it’s not an optimal place to see the view and asked, isn’t there anywhere else? A bar or swimming pool? And this woman replies that I’m not allowed to take photos in the swimming pool out of privacy concerns. First, I really doubt that’s true given all the social media photos of the pool floating around on the internet. But what really rubbed me the wrong way is that she offered the lamest answer and only seemed to take interest in telling me what I was not allowed to do. She didn’t offer me any help in suggesting a place I could actually take photos, just really seemed to enjoy shooting down what I was asking for. Since I wasn’t going to get any real answers out of her, I just shook my head and left.   I would assume that 100% of the people who go to the Rosewood are interested in the view so I don’t know why this question is handled in this way. Anyway, over the course of my stay, I found out myself by just using the hotel that the swimming pool does have a fantastic view, as does the gym, as does the bar on the higher floors. She could have even pointed me to the lobby cafe lounge just beyond the front desk and check in area. Really, it’s just extraordinarily lame what she did.   Bad moment 2:  On my last day there, I wanted to arrange a takeaway breakfast as I had to catch a flight. I assumed this would mean they would give me a box or two and a to-go cup. I paid and then the staff disappeared for 5 min leaving me outside the restaurant. When they came out they said they had packed me a breakfast. I said actually no, I would like to pack my own as I have some dietary restrictions and also just taste wise, I would prefer to choose items myself. They told me I’m not allowed to choose and it only includes bread and fruit.   I told them if that’s the case then they should’ve explained that the to-go breakfast is very different to the dine-in, that I do not have all the options from the buffet available to me before I signed and paid. I looked at what they packed and it was 3 sweet pastries. I loled and told them I didn’t want this at all and there was no way I’m going to eat it. It’s richly processed carbs and unhealthy for anyone as a breakfast. All I wanted were some eggs and fruit. They kept on telling me no, that I couldn’t go in. So I asked for a manager. Only because I demonstrated how unhappy I was and said I’m not going to take this box did they finally allow me to go in and choose items myself.   But it didn’t quite end there. They insisted on following me around and watching what I took as if they’re some kind of bodyguard for the food to protect it from me. When I went to get the fruit, they told me they only want me to take whole fruits. I said what’s wrong with cut fruits? The restaurant manager herself told me it’s not easy to takeaway. I told her, it’s completely fine and why don’t you let me decide what I find convenient to eat or not. I was finally allowed near the cut fruit station. But then they insisted on holding the tongs and grabbing the cut pieces of fruit on my behalf. I was really really sick of them. I asked for the tongs myself.   I don’t have an issue with reasonable rules. Of course the takeaway breakfast is not going to be the same as the dine-in experience but to pay over 200 rmb to just be shoved some random unhealthy pastries because of some inane rules, I find unacceptable. I would think a logical rule would be something like you’re limited to two boxes and one beverage. Or maaaaybe, I can see the logic if they said you’re not allowed to take liquids like soups out—although honestly it’s not a big issue to pack a soup either in the right container.   For drink, I asked for a coffee--an espresso with a dash of milk. They seemed confused so I suggested why don’t you bring me the two separately and I can add my own milk. I don’t know why, maybe they themselves don’t drink coffee and therefore understand how it works but they brought me two cups: an espresso and then a FULL cup of milk both in to-go cups. I sighed and just opened them and added a splash of milk into the cup that held the espresso. I really wish they would’ve not wasted an extra cup. Going back to the original point, if you just let me take my own food and drink, it would be much more straightforward and less wasteful.   I’d really love to hear an explanation for the above two situations. I asked about the general manager and they said they have none. That could explain why quality slips.   Anyway, if they are going to be so obsessed with rules, it would be nice if they could enforce the ones that count and actually detract from the experience. For instance, the hallway of the floor I was on sometimes smelled like cigarettes, so they could care more about that than fretting about cut mango somehow not being portable.   If you look at other reviews, the patchy service seems to be a trend. Please fix your subpar members of your staff and bring them in line.",1
44494,"On the positive,  the hotel was great,  clean, friendly staff,spacious rooms and good value.  However it was a long way from the centre.  There is tram 14 which goes from nearby the hotel but the journey is 35 to the Duomo.    This is fine but just be aware that the hotel is at the end of the line.  We got some good value rooms and were prepared to travel to save money but you lose on convenience.  You can’t go back to the hotel and change for the evening as its too far.  It depends in your priorities.  Also the hotel is right by a petrol station and in a business/ high rise flat kind of suburb.  The area has zero Milan charm.  ",1

As a tourist, I asked few questions at the concierge getting around Tokyo and was astonished when asked “don’t you have a cell phone,” as if I should do my own research. Typical of the service targeted for non-Japanese tourist but they could do better. ",1
15537,"We arrived at the Hostel early evening on a Friday having flown into Oakland. Powell street train station is a couple mins walk to the Hostel and is also the start of the famous Street carts/trams, so it was easy to navigate via these landmarks. The Hostel staff were very welcoming and had no problems in answering any questions we had. We opted for a private dorm and stayed for 3 nights. If you are reading this review you would of already found out how expensive it is to stay in San Francisco, this accommodation was no different. I would say the accommodation was a bit overpriced however it represented value for money for the location alone. The room was clean and pleasant and had a wash basin, towels were also provided with the room. On each floor there were several toilets/showers that were cleaned daily. The shower cubicles were a tad small but you never had to wait that long for one in the morning. The breakfast provided helped save us some money as were travelling on a strict budget. It consisted of bagels, breads, preservatives, porridge and fresh fruit with fruit juice and hot beverages to accompany, It certainly filled a hole until early afternoon. We found eating in San Francisco was very expensive and to combat these costs we opted to buy our lunches for the day from the Wallgreens from around the corner. For less than $15 we could buy a substantial packed lunch compared to paying $30+ for two sandwiches in a restaurant.",1
29002,"With every light on in the guest room, I still had trouble reading. No lamp at the desk. Beds comfortable, slept very well. High floor. Don't be fooled! My ""view"", which I thought would be awesome, was like looking into a courtyard of a quadrangle. All we could see was offices and buildings. Front desk and concierge personnel were very nice, helpful, and hospitable. No in-room coffee! Had to go to lobby to access and bring it upstairs. I don't remember the last time I didn't have this basic amenity. If ever? Good location, near most touristy things by foot or short cab ride. Oddly configured room (""mega""). Big screen-wall mounted TV off to the side of the beds. Very awkward. Shower pressure very low. Hard water. More of a business person clientele? Only newspaper on site was WSJ.",1
13550,"Rooms are quite big, clean and apparently they have been refurbished recently.  The beds are comfortable. However, I would expect more sitting space, especially that the rooms are big enough to accomdoate a sofa or at least another chair. There was only one chair and one stool for 2 people which does not really suit a 4 star hotel. Bathroom was also spacious and clean, towels changed regularly.  Swimming pool was lovely and it was very comfortable to be able to use complimentary sunbeds on the beach. The staff was very firendly. However, breakfast was very disappointing. There was little choice and  literally nothing healthy to eat, everything packed with sugar, maybe some ham, eggs and provolone, but no vegetables and limited fruit options. Milk was ice cold and juice was too sweet - undrinkable. For people from Europe - you will be totally disappointed as it is nowhere near 4 star standards of breakfast in a European hotel. I would recommend  to skip breakfast while booking your room, if possible. It would be much better to eat  breakfast somewhere else.",1
33155,"- Direct access to the beach - Resort style facilities including the large pools (both indoor and outdoor) and hamman were well maintained and designed - Rooms are large, modern but tastefully decorated with some Tunisian elements.  - Buffet restaurant is excellent in terms of quality and variety of food. We had full board and entrees were seldom repeated. I particularly like the live cooking stations  Cons: -They mixed up our room registrations (with our wifi login- and it took a while to resolve) - We were routed in circles when we wanted to borrow table tennis bats. The reception asked us to check with the pool area. There was no one at the pool area. The staff at the beach bar said they didn't know and asked us to go and check with the reception. We just gave up after searching for a while. - The indoor facilities close at 7pm (Indoor pool, hamman, gym etc) which is odd for a beach resort. You are limited to the bar area if you want anything to do night.",1
16218,"This place looks horrible! They are literally hanging on by a thread. This is by far the worse hotel i have ever stayed in. There is mold everywhere, including the rooms. They have used several coats of paint to try and cover it but it didn’t work. I honestly think sleeping outside would have been safer than staying at this hotel. My friend saw a roach in the bathroom. The air conditioning broke! Twice. We stayed there two days and each day it broke, oh let’s not forget the massive leaks we had in our room from the air being broken. I had to demand some Sort of compensation because the staff could care less. Probably because they had air in the lobby. This hotel needs to be demolished! The pool looks suspect as well. It looks dirty and unsafe. Please do NOT STAY HERE!! It looks nothing like The pictures!!!",1
29919,"The mattress/bed were like sleeping on crunchy plastic. Every move you make, so you were being woken up by this blasted noise. Very annoying. The pillows are crap.

There was no counter space in the bathroom for more than a toothbrush.  The air conditioner kept blowing the curtains open so I had to pin them closed.  Kids in the house next door started screaming in their back yard early in the morning.  Inadequate parking, I was forced to use parking at the restaurant next door and damaged my car trying to back out of the tight space partially blocked by a concrete post in my blind spot.  The price was high for what I got.",1

50051,"STAY AWAY!!   This place is a joke. I honesty cannot understand the good reviews of this hotel on this site. The rooms are small, dark, smell and do not look anything like what the pictures show on booking.com.   Our room was tiny. Although this was not the issue as we do not mind a small room. The room we were given (room 4) was located underneath the pool and smelt very strongly of chemicals. The air conditioner was also full with mould and was producing smelly air. Within ten minutes of being in the room my partner and I were feeling very ill and light headed.  We informed the manager and asked if we could please move to a different room and she told us that we could not change as the hotel was completely booked up. We returned to our room to give it another go but found ourselves feeling ill again. We had the tiny windows as wide open as they could be and it still smelt like chemicals (very strong smell of bleach and other chemicals).   We then asked if we could please have a refund as we wanted to find another hotel but were told that due to the cancellation policy this could not be done. We have stayed in many hotels in Santorini and throughout Europe and do understand the cancelation policy but given these circumstances (the room being completely unfit for a human to sleep in) we thought there was justification for a refund.   We decided to leave the hotel as we could not stand to be in that room. It is completely unacceptable to offer a room of this standard to guests, regardless of the price.   Other areas of the hotel:   Pool - The pool is far smaller than it appears in the pictures. It is also mostly shallow (knee depth - not joking) and very unclean.   Outdoor areas - The hotel is small and the rooms are basically on top of each other. No one has any privacy as guests have to fit in where they can on chairs outside other people's rooms. As a result every room is very loud. All the rooms are extremely dark.   Service - Reception isn't open during the day. The manager comes to meet you when you arrive but then leaves for the entire day. We did not get any explanation of the island or where the closest restaurants or supermarkets are - we weren't even provided a map!  We checked in at midday and then called the manager at 1pm to ask if we could speak to her at reception (to ask for a map of the town or advice on where to eat etc, or if we could change rooms) and were told there was a map in reception (there was no map) and that she would not be back to reception until 5pm.    Price - This place is incredibly over priced for what it is. We asked neighbouring hotels if there were rooms available last minute and there were immaculate rooms for just 20 euros more per night than we were paying in Nefeli.   We are mid twenties and have stayed in a number of places in Santorini (and throughout Europe) and trust me there are plenty of better options to stay on the island! I would not recommend this hotel at all. You are completely paying for the view (from the crammed public spaces). However, ALSO NOTE - you CANNOT even see the sunset from this hotel. ",1
42240,"we arrived at 5.30pm and have to wait for 1.5hours for check in and there's no sign for accor silver member counter. The lady said that i should come to this counter, well how do i know if theres no sign. Long wait for lift especially certain hours. Some of the lift doesnt even work and one of the lift's door are having issue with the door.   Hotel room is old and kitchen appliances especially spatula are bad quality one.  Our room, 1 bedroom with kitchenette, we cannot access the balcony. Dont quite sure the reason but we saw other side was able to use the balcony. If there's any construction/building maintenance, you should inform us in advance so we could consider since the rate was included the balcony, so why should we pay much of we cannot utilize it  Hotel shuttle pick up area was close but no sitting area neither roof.   We booked grand circle tour with the tour hotel at the reception, but they didnt pick us up. Is worth $218 and they said we didnt show up. While we were buying coffe at starbuck at 6.25am and wait sitting in front of the lobby since the mahukona st doesnt have any sitting area. They refused to refund instead we only get free airport shuttle  The only good thing for us is well located, near groceries and less crowded area.  Overall this hotel is over rated especially in service and quality. We will never go back to this hotel",1
12151,"Extremely functional hotel. On the airport grounds. With shuttle service to airport terminal (every 20 minutes) or to metro station. Room was larger than many in downtown. Bed comfortable. Linens and towels were large and fluffy. Robes and slippers provided, but obviously sized for Asians, not Europeans or Americans. Shower, but no tub. Only issue was a non functioning hairdryer, which was replaced within 10 minutes. Stayed on the club level. Didn’t use ‘happy hour’ but did use breakfast. Well staffed with usual food choices and an omelette station. Concierge made dinner reservations for us downtown. Highly successful stay. Will return.",1
55566,"I have been disappointed with this Ibis location. With Ibis, you get your basic needs fulfilled. This time, it seemed basic needs standard was even lower.   First, they advertise sleeping like rock stars, but in fact, you feel more like you are sleeping on rocks (especially pillow-wise!) covered with a thin blanket that has seen better days. Then, there are the threadbare towels that feel like paper on your skin. If you want to work, well watch out for the counter edge which has whittled down to wood shards. Since there is no fan in the bathroom, you will want to open the window for the condensation to disperse and there, you will find the window is surrounded by black mold! I could go on to say that they advertised 24-hr food service, which is not the case, but I will stop here because I am sure you get the picture (or look at the pictures attached haha). Oh, and their self-serving coffee machine has been out of order for over a week!  This being said, there are other Ibis hotels that I would return to when back in London., This location, however, is not one of them, especially for longer stays like this one.",1
11196,"My girlfriend and I stayed here in 2014 and in terms of service it was fine albeit a bit brusque at times.   As others have mentioned, the 800 baht for a very small room really is too much, especially considering the fact that the bathroom is shared. AC in the room worked fine.  The communal area is great though and the beer cheaper than elsewhere. Breakfast was meagre; you won't make it till lunch.  All in all a decent stay but indeed overpriced. The atmosphere is lovely and it's centrally located.   I probably wouldn't stay here again, at least not in the corridor  downstairs ",1
18823,"This is a convenient, efficient hotel close to Hudson Yards and Javits Center with decent walking access to other midtown destinations. The hotel has relatively few rooms per floor and decent views from nearly any spot given the surrounding building layout.  The room type I reserved wasn't available when I arrived, but they offered me another selection along with a willingness to move me if I wasn't pleased. My high-floor room was a rare, corner unit so I had views of both the Hudson and up 10th Avenue with windows that opened a bit to allow for some fresh air. While a little worse for wear, the room was clean and functional with a smallish desk, comfortable desk and side chairs, and a wardrobe closet with plenty of hangers. There was also a mini-fridge in the room (not sure if that's standard as it wasn't listed in the amenities, but was a welcome surprise).  The room and bathroom were clean and fresh. Housekeeping was only offered every second day, but there were plenty of supplies and towels to bridge the days. The elevators were prompt and fully functional (a surprisingly rare thing for NY hotels these days). Despite being on a high floor, I never felt stuck waiting to get to my room or the lobby (or making excessive stops on the way).  There are many convenient spots nearby including the small bar and restaurant in the hotel lobby, a Fresh & Co salad and sandwich spot just outside, and a Friedman's restaurant on the opposite corner. Whole Foods is just three blocks down 10th and Hudson Yards with many restaurants is even closer. The Highline north entrance is close as is the Javits Convention Center. If coming from Newark Airport, this hotel is practically immediately outside the exit of the Lincoln Tunnel which made for a fast and easy arrival into Manhattan.  The only immediately close subway line is the 7 train, but a modest walk of a few blocks will take you to Madison Square Garden/Penn Station or a variety of North/South subway lines.  My only negative experience outside of not having the room I reserved ready was that the adjacent room had some sort of door latch problem which led maintenance staff to try to fix it by slamming the door against the jam over and over again for approaching an hour late on my first evening. It made for a challenging start to the trip.    Given the quirky nature of the problems I experience, I will still gladly return to this FP Sheraton for future business in the area.",1

66702,"Stayed for 10 nights at ibis canning town. The room was nice and mostly clean. Very good location and we got a quiet room that’s facing away from the tube station. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was affordable with a good spread of options. However there was no room and laundry service and the room lacked some necessities - phone (had to contact the front desk via WhatsApp and later on their WhatsApp phone seemed to stop working for a few days), fridge (really needed this), iron and ironing board, and safe. Also when I got uber eat and asked for a fork they refused to give me one and said only paying customers who bought food at their cafe could have it. That was a bit annoying actually. But overall a decent stay for a 3 star hotel. ",1

56705,"I was staying in the Hotel for 3 nights because I got attracted by the lower rates compared to other 5 star hotels in the city. That was a big mistake: The location is horrible, no public transport available and no cab driver knows that place. Seems like it is in the middle of a whole sale market area. I was always stuck in traffic for 15-20 minutes leaving or coming back. The management doesn’t seem to care about anything happening on- or besides their area.  Rooms are clean and full of light. However the hotel is surrounded by construction, 24 hours ongoing loud construction!!! Sleep was hard to get.  Breakfast is a JOKE! Staff is nice, choice and quality is ridiculously BAD for calling themself 5 Star hotel. I went there once during my stay - absolutely no need to go again as a frequent visitor of other REAL 5 star places. Overall evaluation: for sure not a five star hotel and I would never come back when in Shenzhen, as there are a lot of better choices.",1

23610,"Whilst the property looks nice from the outside, unfortunately when you get inside everything changes - there is a strange musty smell and the floors are filthy. The entrance feels more like a Hostel than a hotel with an old desk and only one person working who couldn’t speak English - not the welcome we had hoped for!  I hoped the room would be better however the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned - the receptionist did apologise and she came to clean the room herself.   Throughout the night the bed felt itchy and the next morning we woke up with bites.   Looks nice on the pictures but don’t be tricked. In need of a good renovation and clean - certainly not worth the risk particularly in these times where cleanliness is of upmost importance.",1
28731,"I had booked a private room. For the price you pay for a centrally located hostel in comparison with normal hotels it is a okay deal. Very friendly and accomodating staff, had good tips of where to go and how to get there. They are interested in how you are and how your day was.   The breakfast is limited for the price paid. Also the exact same breakfast is there every day, which isn't really special. And served a little late (07:30) in the morning. Early starters need to find breakfast elsewhere or make your own.  The room I was in (29B), has a window facing the hallway. The curtains aren't thick enough to block that light from illuminating the room. That should be fixed, as rooms to sleep in should be really dark. Other than that the room was clean and the bed comfortabele with a locker box that holds a suitcase and a trolley underneath the bed.   Showers are kept clean and provide enough water at a good hot temperature. And there was always one available for your needs.  Other guests could consider sleeping guests a bit more, woke up at night when conversations were finished in the hallway.  Other than those few points, I really had a nice stay and would consider them for a future visit.",1
37995,"Our stay was okay. Staff are lacklustre, but it’s fine.   I asked for a quiet room and was put on the ground floor right next to a large room for hire which was not quiet.  Breakfast was self service, but that didn’t stop the waitresses putting requests for tips in leather folders on the table for every member of our party (4!) before we had even started eating. All we asked for from them were pots of tea, and apparently they had no lids for the teapots.  I’d stay here again, but only if it was booked on my behalf.  ",1

Could not get the TV casting to work which was frustrating as well. Wouldn’t really recommend unless you had no choice. ",1
13010,The staff have been very helpful trying to accommodate out check-in time.   Location is the best as well: a 2 min walk from the embankment and 10 min away from all central attractions.   However the air conditioning did not work in our room and the staff did not attempt to change the room or fix the aircon. The windows of our room opened onto a construction site where heavy duty machinery were banging on until midnight. Obviously we could not close the windows as the aircon was broken. So check your room!   There was no soap in the dispenser and the staff did not once attempt to fill it in until we complained.   Breakfast is now is a next building which is a little inconvenient but not a big deal. The breakfast was very tasty and we enjoyed the atmosphere.

52133,"You are taking your chances when you book at this hotel.  Apparently, some of the rooms are lovely, but not all.  When we booked, we were promised an ocean view and the online photo looked charming.  The actual room, seven flights down very steep stairs, was a dank cave carved into a hillside with creepy inaccessible storage lofts looming above. What might be up there peering down as we sleep? Your guess is as good as mine!  The damp musk smelled atrocious, which the hotel clearly knew, given the presence of an unplugged dehumidifier in the middle of the floor. We could not leave the only window open at night to air out the stench, since it opened to an exterior service corridor, making it a simple matter for any person to easily step into our room.  As two female travelers (or any traveler, really), this wasn't safe for our person or belongings.  A few of the electrical sockets didn't function, the towels were old and frayed, the bathroom was tiny and moldy, and the beds were uncomfortable and hard.  Charging 225 Euros a night for this is unconscionable. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were told that he wasn't available to speak with us, nor was he willing to call us back, but that we could email the hotel at the generic address to voice our concerns.  After several minutes of vigorous objection, I was told by the receptionist that she would attempt to locate him.  About half an hour later, he called and spoke in an extremely combative fashion to my traveling companion.   I felt so sorry for the lovely young woman at the front desk valiantly attempting to manage a situation clearly not of her making or under her control.

We booked our hotel room in advance, and when we arrived at the door, we were told that Americans were not welcome.  When I explained that we had not been in America for several months, the front desk stated that it did not matter and that we had to leave.  I asked why we were not informed before coming, and they said that they assumed we were Taiwanese when we booked.  This is an odd statement, since our names are as western as they come.  I will give the hotel credit for helping us to book another hotel and escorting us to the new hotel.  But, as one can imagine, the whole experience was rather uncomfortable and a bit humiliating.  Please do not book this hotel right now so that you do not have to go through the same ordeal.  ",1
62903,"This is a hotel of contradictions. The room we had was very tired, the room was dull with brown wall paper that must be years old judging by the lifting and peeling, the same is true of the carpet brown in colour worn and ill fitting the dullness was not helped by the single small window. There were no USB outlets, of the two unused plug sockets, one socket didn’t work. The TV channels were limited and the claim of a streaming link didn’t work, appeared out of date. The bathroom is exceptionally dated parts aren’t fitted properly including the toilet flush and shower bracket. There is no shower screen so taking a shower is difficult, nor is the shower thermostatically controlled. On top of this the air conditioning is either too hot or freezing cold, there is also an a/c unit running full blast outside the room which is intrusive. On top of this we were bitten by bugs or mosquitoes which was most unpleasant. I started this review by saying its a hotel of contradiction, the public areas are in total contrast, bright and high quality, the staff are polite and helpful as you would expect from a 5* hotel, the breakfast high quality and served in the bright atrium. This makes the contrast to the dreary dilapidated room even more stark - at over £300 a night (we stayed 3 nights) its very poor value. Having completed the hotel survey with the same sentiments I would have expected an appropriate reply. We would not chose to stay here again, very disappointing.",1
37712,"A couple of days ago me and my husband came to this hotel to check the facilities because we were considering staying here in September. Plus we are Hyatt members. The reason I'm writing this review here is not because we stay here, but because of the service we got. At the reception the staff completely ignored us, I guess it was because we travel with a backpack, so for them I guess we don't look like their ""normal"" costumers I guess. We ask to see the facilities and they denied to show us the pool/gym and just show the room, with really bad manners the girl from the reception was constantly on her phone checking messages instead of guiding us through the facilities. Such a bad attitude and again I feel this was because we don't look like normal costumers we are backpackers. She just tried to change her attitude when we told her that we are Hyatt members. Please remember that not all backpackers are counting cents, and if they are and they decide to treat themselves with a nice stay in a hotel they should be treated equally the same. Please educate your staff. Definitely not staying in in September.",1
25154,"I am a fan of this hotel from long time but recently i was really shocked how poorly they protect clients from Covid. The people working wear masks, the place are cleaned and you have gel dispenser but... BUT... nobody check if clients wear masks in elevator... clients go around breakfast restaurant without mask speaking close to kitchen, to bread, to juice... is such a pity.  It is needed to create a barrier to Covid or we go again in lock down!!! People is crying about low guests... you do not solve the problem letting people doing whatever they want... you do fighting against the spread of it!!!  Put someone at the entrance of elevator, breakfast lobby... for the respect of your employees and your guests!!!",1
21504,"Our experience was tarnished by the fact that this hotel never got around to refunding their 300 USD deposit.  When checking out we were assured that the it would be refunded in 7 days. After 10 days, we followed up and they said refunds can take up to 3-4 weeks for international cards. It has been over 4 months and we've got nothing back. They don't respond to emails and calling them over and over again has just resulted in them saying that they don't know what's wrong.  We used the same card at other hotels in the US without any issue. At Hyatt they issued a hold for the deposit and never charged the card. ",1
4270,"I reserved an easy access disabled room for myself and my niece who has Cerebral Palsy and is wheelchair bound.  I reserved this room on the 30th November 2021 in plenty of time for our stay as we were going to Wimbledon, and even checked on the 16th March to ensure it was a disabled access room and it had disabled access bathroom.  Which I was ensured it was.  Upon arriving at the hotel, I was told the room was not available!! I had no notification that the room was not available, apparently it had a leak !!!  I explained I need a disabled access room and was again told, not very nicely that the room was not available, but we could go into a Studio Room .. I said does it have a disabled access bathroom .. no was the answer !! but that is what we have.  I am absolutely disgusted that I was not informed that the room was not available, had I known I could of found another hotel with the correct facilities for what we needed.  I said to the reception guy, when will that room be available.. he said it could be tomorrow I can let you know in the morning.  I explained we will see how me manage for the first night and if someone could let us know when the room was available the next day we could move over.  No one checked to see if the room was ok with us, we didn't actually have any communication with anyone until we left.",1

16800,"I had an opportunity to have a stay in Lotte  city hotel mapo recently. I was staying in a double bed room. The room is not considered big but it is comfortable enough. What I enjoy is the bathroom is big. The shower room and toilet seats are separate so it can keep dry. There is a bathtub too. The facilities in hotel include gym and pool.   The location is very convenient. It is located at gongdeok station and it is very near to the subway station. It is right beside the subway station! You don't even have to go out from the station because there is a lift link to the hotel. at the basement of hotel, there are lots of restaurants. Convenient shop is just at the opposite of the hotel too. Besides, it takes only one station (5mins) to hongdae! gongdeok station has the airport railway so you can go to airport directly. It was a nice stay. If u have some budget and prefer for a comfortable stay, u can consider lotte city hotel in mapo!",1
31116,Lovely hotel but unhelpful front desk staff. Check in was for 2 and I arrived after 1. I couldn't get my room til 3 as room not ready. Lady on reception wasn't very helpful.. While I was there there was construction going on in the floor above me. I was up and out early (before 7) the 1st morning and came back at 11 when I noticed it. The next morning it started at 7. I told front desk but they said they would tell the manager my concerns but I never heard back. I was able to pre book breakfast for the mornings I was able to make breakfast and this was very good. Location is close enough to vatican and a decent walk to the city centre. There is a metro station close by should you need it. ,1
17077,"There are several areas that are severely lacking. Although we only spent one night our experience was riddled with service failures.  Very basic, more 3 star and it is not a wine estate. They do not produce any wine and they do not have wine tastings and their staff have no knowledge of wine let alone what's on their wine list. It basically has a somewhat architectural appearance in the common areas of a wine estate   Room: - Safe was broken (apparently a common occurrence  according to the front desk, so why hasnt it been addressed?) - Phone not working, so you have walk to reception if you need anything - No hair dryer available  - Clogged  and leaking sink  - Leaking toilet     Spa  - Booked the use of the facilities but the facilities were not working 2 hot tubs not working, Steam room not working, Sauna not working and the ones that were working were overcrowded  - If they knew this, why didn't they inform guests or better yet why did they accept bookings  - The heated pool was not heated   Restaurant: Library Bar - Incorrect drinks orders - long wait for drinks (even finished the meal before drinks arrived )  Granita - Several wines not available  - poorly trained waitrons - Waited one hour for starters because the waiter forgot - Overpriced and not value for money... over exaggerated descriptions with very poor execution in delivery   Kingsley  - Just an overall shambles  - Not enough glasses or plates, when you ask staff they tell  you to ask someone else  - No basic labels for the food buffet, a very basic requirement for a buffet so you know what you're eating especially when it comes to meats  - Takes ages to get a cup of coffee - No management/manager overseeing operations   - too few waitrons   Overall a very poor and disappointing experience, They're execution is a very far cry from what they promise.",1
1902,"I would never go to this beach club again. I do not understand all the hype surrounding it. From the time arrived I got a negative vibe. The valets only cared for the money men in big cars, didn’t help direct us to the right place and outside was absolute chaos. Once inside it was hectic, it was over crowded and staff were just rude!   We were offered sun beds with no umbrellas which everyone that were guest complained about. I can’t understand why a big hotel that holds major events can’t accommodate all sunbeds with umbrellas. We were then moved to multiple different tables like musical chairs. It took over an hour for our food to come and when it finally arrived mines had hair in it.   Anyways, to cut this story short. It was absolutely disappointing, I made a reservation for my best friends birthday and I felt like I let her down because of such poor service and just an overall bad event. We went for ladies day and it was anything but !    Don’t waste your money here, it’s full of girls looking for opportunities and the staff are horrible. ",1
31376,"I see advertisements about Lykia World on some websites.    These advertisements use pictures of the facility when it was first opened.  Everywhere is sparkling and shining.    I wish the current state of the facility could be like in those pictures!    Currently, many units of this facility are unusable due to lack of maintenance.    The furniture in the rooms is quite old and even the cooling function of the air conditioner does not work in the rooms.    The facility is infested with giant mosquitoes.    A new investment of several hundred million liras may be required in order for this facility to become as advertised.    While this is the case, I do not find it appropriate to use these nostalgic pictures, which hide the current state of the facility, to gain new customers.    I wish this facility could return to its days in those pictures, so we could pay four times more and enjoy a holiday in such a facility..",1

66954,"We  stayed for 4 days and 3 nights in this hostel. We stayed as a family, with three adults and one small child. We got one family room with four beds. We loved it. The atmosphere is fairly quiet and close to the train station. Cheap price for the size of the hostel in Bangkok and family. The problem was  the location is far enough to the tourist sites in Bangkok. You can't reach by walk. You need public transport or Taxi.",1
5046,"Ok so first the positives: the room (executive king) was great - large, comfortable with a wonderful bathroom (with gorgeous Molton Brown toiletries). The bed was super comfortable with wonderful sheets and great pillows. Views were also great. Indoor swimming pool was nice also. Breakfast was really amazing - literally anything you could want was provided and the service was good too. Sadly our stay was marred by poor service at times and their weird additional pricing policies. Now I’m sure this review will just get the the standard, identical reply that all less than positive reviews seem to get from the hotel but here goes anyway! I booked a twin room for 2 adults and 1 child via hotels.com. Photos on the website and information provided by them made it look as though there were 2 double beds ie. big enough for 3 people, however the room had 2 single beds so clearly not suitable for 3. I spoke to the hotel to ask for a king bed room with an extra bed and was told the only room free was a suite at a substantial additional cost. Funnily enough when my Korean friend called the hotel for me, they found an executive king room with an extra bed available... There was an additional cost for the room which was expected but we also had to pay KRW30,000/€23 per night for the extra bed for my daughter which is weird in a room supposedly for 3 people. We’d been told on check in that we could only use the outdoor pool if we paid extra - a total of KRW160,000/€122 per day which is frankly ludicrous for the use of a swimming pool. I went to use the sauna one evening and was told it would be KRW45,000/€35. The sauna reception desk neglected to tell me there was a small, free sauna in the indoor pool, I only found that out later by talking to someone else. We paid extra for a B&B rate but again we had to pay additionally for our daughter’s breakfast to the tune of KRW32,000/€25 per breakfast. The list of phenomenal additional charges just goes on and on and on. It’s so distasteful in a 5 star property, the hotel is clearly there to cater to well heeled Seoul locals who want to use the facilities in their spare time. I’ve stayed in plenty of 5 star hotels and have never encountered this. The hotel also took our suitcase from us at check in and 35 minutes later still hadn’t brought it to our room. I called them and finally it came but they had clearly misplaced it. On our first night, a light beside the door kept flicking on and off when everyone was in bed which meant we had to get maintenance up to the room to disable it which is also something I wouldn’t expect from a 5 star property. I could keep going but you get the gist - in spite of the lovely room and breakfast, it just isn’t 5 star service and the extra charges are beyond reasonable. I’ll stay somewhere else next time. Just waiting now for the standard TripAdvisor reply from the hotel now ;)",1
27841,"When I book hotels in Asia, including Hong Kong and other fairly dense cities, standard rooms often have some semblance of a view. The hotel should specifically indicate that some rooms may face another building's wall, as opposed to rooms with a view -- if I had known that the standard room may *not* to have any view (though it could be that some rooms have a view -- I don't know), I would have booked one that *did* have a view. Considering that we stayed at the property for 8 days, and that the fees we paid were not negligible, I really feel that we could have been provided a better room than one that faced a wall. Granted, the interior design had a few interesting bits, but that was something we got from every other hotel we stayed in in Japan anyway.  The other issue that I had was that wi-fi was abysmally slow. While I stayed at the Niwa on holiday, I still wanted to dial in to a couple of meetings abroad -- impossible with wi-fi where it took a full 5 minutes to upload a 2 MB document.  Yet another one is that for a room with two people, the storage space was almost non-existent. This was NOT true for other hotels in Japan that we stayed in, so I'd definitely say it's below standard.  Would not stay here again.",1
29022,"My colleagues and I come to Chicago for NEOCON every year. Our room was much much smaller than expected. No chair or sofa area- just two beds. I had specifically asked for two queen beds and even called and waited on the phone for 20 minutes to talk to someone just to confirm they are queens. However, when we got there they were double- you could even tell by the queen sized frame that the mattresses were much smaller. We asked for an upgrade to a room with queen sized beds but they ""assured us those were queens"". I wish i had photos just to show how much of a lie that was. They didn't have a cot so instead we got an air mattress for the floor to serve for the extra room... I couldn't believe for the amount we spent we had one of the girls sleeping on the floor... We had to request a  microwave to the room because there was nothing. Overall so disappointed. We come to Chicago every year and we will never stay at the W Chicago City Center again.",1
59498,Stayed here last 2 nights of my vacation in Japan. Service was exceptional as they helped me with directions to the closest subway lines and any sites I wanted to see.

48863,"for a 5 star property charging 5 star prices for everthing from food to spa, this is quite an old and run down property. the only reason for its mediocre popularity is probably the water park, which ALSO was not maintained with clean water. The Beach coast was dirty too. Not at all worthy of the price it demands. Construction work was going on on the floors above us and repeated calls to the reception and managers did not work.",1
5385,"After several years of visiting Nairobi and promising ourselves we would experience the obvious luxury of this beautiful hotel, we finally did and were somewhat disappointed. While the hotel staff were generally friendly and customer centric, there were a couple of noticeable gaps.    1) stranded in Nairobi: we made arrangements with the concierge for a taxi to drop us at a nearby shopping mall, with promises for collection within 15mins of us calling to request a return journey. After we had finished at the mall, we phoned several times over the course of 30minutes before someone answered the phone, at which time the young lady took my phone number and promised the driver would call me when he arrived. After a further 45 minutes I tried phoning again several times, and again no one picked up the phone. We eventually walked to nearby Sankara hotel to request if we could borrow their taxi services. We were back at our room 15minutes later, at which point kempinski concierge phoned me to ask if we still needed a taxi. We were lucky in this case - we found our own way - it might not have been that easy for a stranger visiting Narobi.   2) left hungry: trying to get breakfast before 7am is a challenge. We got to the dining room at 6:45 on a Monday morning and were informed that we were too early - the kitchen only opened at 7am. Since we had to leave the hotel at 7 for an appointment, we inquired about getting a cup of coffee and a slice of toast - but were informed by the waitress that this was completely impossible and we would have to wait. On our way out the hotel we tried the k-lounge only to find they also had nothing available... luckily a waiter took pity on us and produced a quick cup of coffee and a croissant. We never got his name - but his kindness went a long way on a day where we had to sit in queues for 7hours.   What a mixed bag of good and bad; certainly not what I expected.",1
45457,"Disappointing experience for a Ritz Carlton. Although recently renovated (2-3 years), the property is dated. The suite assigned to me smelled of cigarette smoke.  Mainland Chinese Customers smoke in rooms. Changed suite and although better, the thick carpet was still permeated in the persistent  smell of smoke. The automatic blinds did not working smoothly and the room had a dated feeling. Service as far as the attention to the small details is concerned is missing.No WOW factor. Concierge service is inexistent.. Check in  process is convoluted. Breakfast is ok, but not impressive. The hotel seems to lack command and control from Management. Good location. Conrad Hotel is a better overall Property!",1
59245,"Train noise maybe isn't an issue in every room, but in ours (top floor, north side) it was comically bad. It started early in the morning, and could hear the brakes screeching thru our earplugs. Shower pressure at 8am was literally a dribble, but water was still warm. Breakfast was pretty fair, toast/spreads and cereals. Four floors and no stairs as its an old building. Wouldnt come back here but they've done a fair job w what they have.",1

16487,"We booked our accomodation for 2 nights, arrived and they claimed to not have our reservation. We got downgraded to hotel next door which was quite upsetting and was difficult moving between two locations for two nights. They were also quite un-accomodating and did not offer to carry our luggage up the stairs even though we were clearly struggling. We also received no compensation for the booking mix up. Besides this the place is pretty and in a good location. It has a very nice balcony and pool. I would recommend this place but we just had an unfortunate experience and hope the staff can improve in the future.",1

On first glance the room seemed clean, but i dropped something down the side of the locker and when I pulled it out it was filthy! Very dusty and clearly not cleaned in a long time. The rest of the room had grubby walls and very stained carpet. The pillows were exceptionally thin and we asked for extra. They were certainly pass their sell by date.  The receptionists were very unfriendly, apart from one nice male receptionist. He was friendly.  ",1
57148,"Probably the most disappointing international hotel I've visited in the last few years. Room I got was quite small, toilet room was even smaller so that it was not comfortable to seat in there. Window curtain is not dense enough, so in the morning you get some amount of sunlight in the room after dawn. Add some amount of noise from the street in the morning (even with closed window) - and you cannot sleep later in the morning. Probably the best thing about the whole hotel is its room service. Some personnel at breakfast was rude.",1
50240,Unfortunately I could not rate this hotel any higher  The staff wre great & helpfull  but I dont know how this hotel got a 3 star rating our usaul 2 star hotel we stay at is a lot better We arrived to a hot room & turned the aircon on unfortunately after a couple of hours the room stayed hot.Our usual hotel has the room aircon alredy running when we arrive The next morning after a restless sleep we reported it to mangementand he sent a maintainence guy to check it. Unfortunately it did not really fix the issue  the aircon just was not adequate.We still slept every night with no sheets or bed covers to be comfortable You need to leave a keycard oin a reader to leave the power on and their solution was to give us a spare keycard to leave in there so the aircon run all day. We also reported the bar fridge was not working only to be informed it was not actually a fridge but a cooler????.The manger had a proper all be it noisy fridge put in the room The breakfast was average to say the least with no real variety & the restarant if you call it a restarant is only open till 2pm.(Not a restarant at all just a basic kitchen) The deck around the pool is dangerous with nails & screws poking out & loose boards & why the pool closes at 7pm is beyond belief .Our normal hotel has a similar set up with rooms close to the pool and it is open till 10pm. This hotel just has no ambiece  but is good if you just want a cllean room to sleep in>,1

19438,For $300 a night we expected more. The room was not big at all. The view was the pool and breakfast area plus the beach if you could call it a beach - I will get onto that later. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast had a great amount of choices and the pool area was very nice due to not having to fight for a sunbed due to two pools and the pool attendents being mindful of people reserving sunbeds. Great hotel for children with activities going on all day long. If you swam in the pool there was a layer of oil from sunscreen which is probably unavoidable. Staff were accommodating and the spa wonderful. We are beach people and were very disappointed with the beach only having a couple of  metres of sand then went into mudflats/black sand. The tide comes in only for a few hours and you have to walk a long way out to get any depth. What really worried us was alongside the hotel 5 minute walk to the left is a huge open drain that smelt so bad that you gagged. This drain must have been sewage and spilt open onto the mudflats. For health and safety we did not swim in the ocean for this reason. There are massage tables near to the drain and for the life of me the smell would not be pleasant if you were trying to have a relaxing massage. You need transport if you are here as you are in the quiet area and there is nothing much around.,1
38919,"Location is quite good, it is 1,5 km to Sacrada Familia by walk. Metrostation (L2) was near. But we did find this bug in bed. Luckily only one and not bites in our bodies. Very basic hotel. Friendly staff. But I would not choose this hotel again.",1
32746,We booked 2 nights at this hotel for 2 adults and 2 children only to arrive in the hotel room with no extra beds for our kids. It took us 3 trips to reception to ask what was the issue as we had our proof of booking and paying for 4 occupants. My kids were tired and wanted to sleep. A cot bed was provided about 2 hours after our initial request. Service is slow and not up to standard. Definitely won’t be my first choice of 5 star in Bahrain. The last night we were there the shuttle from the water taxi was 45 minutes late is the summer heat and we walked to the hotel. Not a great experience,1

Smaller hole-in-the-wall style, non-chain hostels lack the modernity of the Generator chain of hostels, but make up for it in hospitality and warmth by the staff.

246,"We were disappointed by our stay at Le Clarisse. The room was nice, spacious with a huge bathroom, relatively clean. The courtyard is a pleasant to have breakfast and relax, however the breakfast was of very poor quality - it felt like the items were first price, tasteless ham and cheese, disgusting coffee, chewy bread,... The Relais is conveniently located to explore Rome with lots of restaurants and bars for the evening.  I was unpleasantly surprised at the end to see that we were charged nearly double what we were expecting to pay. We had booked via booking.com. I hadn't read the fine prints as even if you ""declare"" the kids when you book, they are not included in the cost per night. I use booking a lot, and it's the first time I see this. We ended up paying 250 euros a night instead of 150. The kids (under 7) shared our room, and the extra cost seems unjustified. The hotel also charges 30 eurso per night for a cot bed! Not only it feels too much for what it is but it also feels a bit like we were scamed.",1
57914,"The hotel is a really quirky one. Very immotive atmosphere. The room I was in room 0. Dark wood, and darkish walls with orange and terracotta interspersed. A sort of Moroccan or Mediterranean feel to it. Very spacious. TV and WIFI provided. And a hairdryer. It was one of the typical brown houses with the steps at the front. Although this room as down a couple of steps in a court yard. So at ground floor. I felt the atmosphere of the place, could imagine previous owners playing jazz etc. lol. However I so have some negative things it add, saying that I'm so happy that I did stay there and experienced Harlem. I'm a solo traveller. So at night I felt a bit vulnerable as there are a lot of homeless people around the park, which is at one end of the street. Saying that you can avoid that by knowing you way around and avoiding that end. I got lost one night and went the long way home. Haha. There is also a very radical church at the other end of the road, with emotive signs. Freaked me out a bit. But I also saw a Racoon crossing the road that freaked me out too at first, then made me feel chuffed as I'd seen it. They are as big as a dog btw. I wasn't approached by anyone and when you get it right the distance to the underground is about 5 minutes walk. On the Friday afternoon I wandered and the place was full of happy families with children coming home from school all in neat little uniforms, as if from a private school. Other travellers at the Bnb were mainly couples from Europe. Plus the place is very clean, but one night I did go to the loo and turned the light on and a beetle scurried away under the skirting board. ( happened twice) so I left the light on in the bathroom! It was definitely an experience going to Harlem. Loved it really, even if I was a bit frightened walking home in the dark. Lol.ps. No problem if you are with someone I would imagine.",1
41086,"As I am writing this review, I can tell you I have just survived a tragedy with six unruly men led by their ring leader Jill at Le Meridien.  I’m a senior journalist and my wife is a TV host.  I am writing this while sitting at the front desk interacting with an operations head Jill.  This man is a scare for us. He threatened us to delete the review on Tripadvisor or else he wont allow us to stay at Marriott hotel.  When my first review got published, he barged into my room with two men and a bell boy, giviing us two options — to delete the review or make a fresh booking with praises for him & his boss.  We have managed to survive this man’s onslaught on us. Al action is recorded in their camera.   While my demure wife kept pleading before him to pack her luggage, he tried to move luggage with his shoes.  He was visibly chafed and livid with our review which i had written.   But now my wife & I are out, we can safely expose their nexus how they ask people to chronicle only positive reviews  Having stated at Marriott for more than 168 nights I, as a platinum elite member, was eligible for an decent room and honour. None of it was available  Jill maintained a hawkish and intimidating stance for pointing out that door was broken, water from basin would overflow into the room. Or basic amenities like bathroom slippers, water, dental kit or shower gels were missing. Or that there were hair strands near the commode.  He used intimidating language, used F word thrice with the same gestures and got lift up to tell me that I must never raise the issue publically or else he would instruct the staff to teach me a lesson.  Believe me or not, within minutes of my having this heated conversation where I maintained politeness as he used profanities, he sent two men barging into our room as water spread into our main room from nowhere.  He never apologised even once  He insisted that no Marriott executive should ever get to know how they run this hotel with staff as he treats this as a fiefdom — visible from thrre men who tried to manhandle, eve tease my wife while she gingerly & innocently packing her luggage.  Later, as we gained cofidence and collected strength to exit Meridien hotel as he mouthed profanities at us, we pleaded to keep our heavy luggage to see the casino around, Jill kept four men on our surveillance to ascertain if we were going to alert local police or tourist police or expose them on Tripadvisor or Marriott’s internal groups.  But I have kept Marriott customer care in loop to ensure his dangerous lies aren’t concealed & the brand image isnt hit.  We as a couple are scared for our life from this man. He’s disgrace to Marriott brand.   I’m attaching the screenshot of previous review which he forced us to delete.",1
31077,"Be aware of the very frustrating fact that you have to pay a so called Resort Fee, but this only gives you access to Gym, and not jacuzzis, steam saunas or any spa facility.  You can also get NO WIFI ACCESS, if someone on the front desk forgets to turn it on for your room.  Also, its absolutely normal if you spend 5 days on the hotel and get housekeeping (cleaning, towels, sheets) on just ONE day.  There is definitely better choices to stay on Vegas, like Aria. (Had the greatest time there).",1
54698,Stayed during Christmas week in room 9. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. You do have to share a bathroom in the hallway but it was kept clean also. My advice is to put a do not disturb sign on bathroom door when using the bathroom. The continental breakfast had a nice selection that stays the same in the morning. The pool area was nice but is only 4 ft. deep so more of a wading or kiddie pool. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because you do have to park 4 blocks away and pay $20 . There is a city parking lot that is a lot closer at Flamingo that maybe could be a better place to park but did not inquire about overnight parking there and also the safety risks. The stairs coming up to the rooms can be loud and out room door slammed when we forgot to close it slowly.  It is a older property which is of course is going to make noise but it is kept up nicely. Would defiantly recommend this place unless you have mobility issues and need to park.,1
67063,"We are a family of 4 with 2 Adults and 2 Kids and 3 big luggage. The room is so small that you can’t even put an extra bed. This room can fit ONLY 2 with 2 luggage. We ran out of bottled drinking water when we returned to hotel at 10pm. Requested staff to provide Bottle water for kids and they told that they can’t provide at that time as services were closed. We are left with no option but to go out of the hotel at that time and buy drinking water bottles. Singapore is a place where one can drink water from taps. Since kids are not used to drinking water directly from bathroom taps, I feel as a hotel one should provide basic necessity at all times. You can’t say that service is closed at 10am and drink water from bathroom tap. Very unprofessional. Passengers returning from Singapore to India need to get Covid test done. Receptionist is not ever aware of nearby covid testing centres instead handed over a list of hospitals to choose from.   Overall I feel that this hotel is not upto the mark for family of 4. I would look for other hotels. ",1
35315,"I have visited a lot of radissons around the world, but this one was baddest.   What was good: swimming pool; big room. What was bad: awful food in the restaurant for high price enough; poor choice of breakfast; poor service, sometimes i was calling twice to service to order something because one call was not enough for then; another bad thing i remembered happened during check-in: girl on the lobby (does not remember her name) gave me my card without any additional information and so on, and just explained me how to reach my room. Btw when i visit radisson i would like to here where is the restaurant and where is the pools and spa and what other services they can offer me else. That’s why i consider my visit like one of the worst.",1
66937,"We stayed here for 3 nights Jan 2017 at the start of our South East Asia trip. The place has a nice feel to it once you step in off the slightly run down area. It is conveniently located and pretty easy to find from Hua Lamphong station which you can get to via a change at Phetchaburi station from the airport. Tickets cost about 70baht together for both trains.  We stayed in a private room with a shared shower facing the room. The toilet was just around a little corner and the sink was pretty large in the hallway in between. We were initially sceptical about sharing facilities as this was our first stop in the trip but we need not worry as they were clean and tidy and others respected the shared space! The owner was really welcoming and made us feel at at home every time we saw her.  Wifi isn't great at this place however and we kinda struggled using it in our room on the fourth floor.  There is a 7-Eleven just below the hostel which is great, the hostel also has its' own cafe open 7am-8pm which sells coffee, beer and snacks. Chinatown is about a 5-10 minute walk down the straight road until you see the archway. Would definitely recommend visiting here for the street food and desserts as well as the street and building signs. Facing Chinatown is the Golden Buddha temple which is also worth seeing, entry is about 40 baht I think.  Tuk tuks or taxis will take you into the centre, around the grand place area as I'd say it was a bit too far to walk.",1
61445,"This is a very conveniently located hotel with very cute, modern rooms. The rooms are small but that is the norm in Japan for the price point. We don't spend much time in the hotels except to shower and sleep so the size doesn't bother me. It has nice amenities available in the room and the hotel offers free ramen from 930-1030pm! The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the shower goes from hot to cold rather quickly, stays cold for a couple minutes before the hot water comes back. It's a bit of a shock!",1
31681,"Have stayed at this La Quinta several times. This last time, very disappointed in the cleanliness. There was trash in the hallway, like it had not been vacuumed, and trash in the elevator. The place looks like it needs renovation. Not like I remembered it from the last time stayed there. Daughter said maybe they were short on help.For the price we paid, it could have been cleaner. Our room was ok, though shabby looking.",1

We seat on the bar because they ask minimum charge for the table...and honestly speaking this kind of service and corkage fee are illegal in china, but let s go to the worst...We seat and after 2 min the waiter come to us to mentioned about the waiting time will be a little bit long because the bar was busy...I saw at the least 30 people working there...how many do you need to serve 50 clients? after my negroni arrived, very small portion ( usully 1/3-1/3-1/3) even can t cover half of the glass with the ice!!! ...we decide to seat outside and pay the bill...the waiter come the first time with the bill...completely wrong ( could be happened), and we mentioned about it...he back again with the same wrong bill plus more drinks inside..third time back again with an other bill....after the 4th time they come with the right bill....What s wrong to this Roosewood? the food and beverage manager has to improve a lot his training....horrible experience and I will never back!!!!",1
477,"The location is top and there is a subway which you might feel / hear but the infrastructure of this hotel is solid (quiet), new and generally well maintained.  We stayed twice in this hotel and unfortunately the second time, now with my parents visiting Milan, we got totally disappointed.  We (couple / young) got the handicap room which was setup for one person only. After complaint I was told that second set of towels can be found in the cupboard and although the hotel had rooms available we were not moved to a regular room.  Also the remote control was probably never cleaned since this hotel opened (see picture).  Last stay for me - try your luck.",1
7438,"The hotel has charm and is centrally but quietly located. You can reach the Opera House in 30 minutes on foot or Kings Cross station in 5 minutes. My room on the 2nd floor was small, but clean and the bed comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. A breakfast possibility is not offered, but all around it is teeming with restaurants. The laundry, which is available for guests, is practical. Unfortunately a late-check-out was only possible until 12 noon, after that a whole night had to be paid. Maybe this is usual in Sydney, I don't have a comparison here; for me it was very impractical. Nevertheless, I would consider the Challis again and also recommend it if one can live with a small room.",1
63407,"The only good thing about this hotel was the location for which I gave the two stars but everything else was lacking. I got a room for 3 people but at check in they gave me only two keys and when I asked the front desk lady for a third key she said that I needed to pay extra money. That should not happen when I’m already paying extra for a third person.  Each adult needs a key as you need to leave one inserted to keep the lights on and to access the elevators. The bathroom in the room had only one partially used toilet paper and no extra anywhere in the room.  With 3 people sharing the room, the second day we ran out of toilet paper so we called the front desk and they told us to come down to get one. Since we were going out, we told them that we didn’t need housekeeping for the day but to have the housekeeping leave fresh towels and toilet paper. When we came back they only left towels and not toilet paper so we had to go down to the front desk to get one. Guests running out of toilet paper must happen frequently as front desk keeps toilet paper with them. Also, when they give you toilet paper is not even wrapped which is unsanitary.  They are cheap with toilet paper so you can imagine what is with the rest. Anyway, I'm not going to get into detains but you can get an idea. Also, there is not enough lighting in the room even with all the lights on. During the day we opened the curtains to let some light in, but because the window is facing another building that is in very close proximity, it does not allow much light into the room.  Overall this is a 2 star hotel. Actually 2 star hotels have better service and amenities. Stay somewhere else.",1
10603,"The hotel is in a nice location. Yolk, the restaurant around the corner is a GREAT place to eat. THe aquarium and Museum are not far away. However, it is VERY hard to find a taxi at this hotel, and it takes lift a while to get there. The Front Desk did not help us wit this. Room ad no fridge, bathroom was not super clean, no TV guide in the room, and overall not the best experience I've had at a Best Western. ",1

There are quality services and friendly personel, I haven't seen drunk or unfriendly bartenders. I saw many germans (maybe over 80%), english, russians, romanians (my case:). Recomended for families because of the silence and order. 3 minimarkets downstairs with everything at regular prices.",1

We arrived and checked in, went to our room and it was like a sauna… we turned the air conditioning on, half an hour went past and it still wasn’t cool. It was that uncomfortable that I laid on the bathroom to try call down!! I called down to reception and they sent someone up to look at it, he couldn’t fix it and said he would get maintenance up to look. An hour or so has no passed without air conditioning. We then get a call from reception saying they can’t fix the air conditioning so we are being moved to another room. We got to reception and collected the new key. We then got to the room and opened the door and got hit with the strongest smell of cigarette. We had an event that night and kinda just had to deal with the smell because at this point we only had 45 minutes to get ready.. the following morning we checked out and explained our experience, quiet disappointed in the receptionist response of “we are sorry you feel that way” no offer of a discount or a refund. So my overall experience is very disappointed.. ",1
43266,"Not a very happy experience with this hotel from the beginning till we checked out.   Firstly we weren’t given a room till 6pm and they aren’t really apologetic and considerate at all when we requested for a late checkout instead.   Secondly we weren’t really able to enjoy the swimming pool as they have a booking system due to pandemic which I understand but it’s always fully booked.  My children are not very happy with our staycation for 4 days this time.   Lastly during checkout they didn’t even attempt to ask how you stay was like other hotels, not like their sister hotel ‘The Royal Plaza’ in Mongkok which is so welcoming.   I’ve been longing to experience the stay with this hotel as they have a very good reviews but It’s just sad coz I’m really very disappointed and I will never come back again.  This will be our first and last stay with ‘The Royal View’.",1

Considered changing hotels but was booked with a group and daughter didn’t want to leave the group so I cleaned counter tops etc myself, decided it was clean enough to be comfortable with.

46396,"I decided to book this hotel as it was in a decentish location but unfortunately alot let it down and I wouldn't go again.  Pros. * Nice decor throughout including Christmas decorations and a seaside/ocean theme. *Good English music played in the lift and entrance floor. *Decent shower. *Cute fish etc in a tank outside. *Lovely pizza in bar.  Cons.  *Staff attitude including telling lies...  Some examples are...  *I go to check in and they tell me off and treat me like some sort of diseased person just for taking off my mask so they can see it is me on my passport. Said check in lady said that the roof top is open to take drinks to, well it was never open during opening hours when I tried to go.  * My first morning there is a knock on my door and it was the cleaner, she clearly understood no English and even though NO means NO in Spanish also left my room and put an ok to clean sign on my door !   * Staff only seem to want to fully understand English when it is convenient to them, I asked one lady if the story on the news was in Spain and she pretend she didn't know even though she could read the subtitles unlike me if she wasn't so lazy.   *Lies at the bar in relation to food I ask if the dish came with anything extra  and they both said no and thus I ordered more and then the dishes come out with multiples of the same things/ side dishes. They lied to get more money out of me.  *Don't sell cocktails you don't even know how to make!  * They advised me to go to a clinic down the same road for a pre flight Covid test, said test wasn't conducted properly, trust me I should know as I have had a Nurse do one before an operation. They will get comission.  *Breakfast as a whole is no where near good enough. You have the Croissant for the French , this for that nationality but nothing for the British and considering we bring the most tourism to Spain it's not good enough. No warm food at all. Some sort of bizarre omlette that was of fridge temperature and was horrible.  *Silly wooden tongs given at breakfast are useless and break and not good enough for people with coordination issues and or hand disabilities. Also the fact that you can't get a clean plate after you have eaten something messy is stupid.",1

I had expected it to be closer to the Shibuya centre (should probably have looked it up before) but it's a fifteen minute walk from the crossing and in a quieter area.   Didn't meet any other travellers either, probably because I didn't spend much time there, but could also be because the lobby wasn't really an optimal place for meeting people (it was transformed into a restaurant later in the evening).   However, would recommend to stay here. It's a good hostel.",1

The bathroom was dirty. Also, when we asked to extend for one night, we had to pay twice as much for an extra night.  Overall the actual hostel wasn’t very good, the pool was nice and the restaurant seems cheap but it isn’t because one course doesn’t fill you up so end up paying for two meals. ",1

I have been a host on Airbnb for a number of years and a host (someone with a listing) has 3 options when they have selected ""dynamic pricing"" on their listing: 1) send a special offer matching the rate you just agreed to. 2) Agree to adjust the rate back to what you agreed to after the booking (by giving a refund in Airbnb), or 3) Turn dynamic pricing off and adjust the rate manually back to the rate you already agreed to.

We then had to wait for the bed to be made again with fresh bedding by which time we found more blood stains.  I didn’t get pictures of the worst stains as I didn’t want to look at anymore but I’ve attached a few that I took at first.  Oh, then the fire alarm went off at 4am so we had to wait outside in the rain with our 6 year old until we were allowed back in.

So, we had to move hotels.  Very inconvenient and threw a wrench on one of the days we were planning to site see.  Instead we had to find another hotel.

No more success with emails from me and also emails and calls from the agent. Nobody came back to just even reply or explain what their view is, not a good service for a 5 stars hotel specially for  a “ the Address hotel” which is otherwise an excellent hotel chain.  At the beautiful pool the music is now very loud and the service very slow as it took me 40 minutes to just get a drink. Hotel guests have no advantage versus outside clients. The fact it is managed by an outside company doesn’t help.

We only ask for 1 extended hour and they only agree to extend for half an hour due to peak season. Quite unacceptable considering the hotel size. 3. Staff is so rigid and they won't go above and beyond to impress your stay. With the same amount of money that you pay probably it's better to stay in other 5* hotels. 4.

The hotel room itself is quite small, there will be no room for your big luggage, the shower room is standard (No bathtub, as there is onsen in level 2). I will recommend not to order their breakfast as menu never change and you will eat the same thing every day (Apart from one pasta dishes that will be changed every day).  There are a lot of vending machines which is good.

9737,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights. The service is good and they were very friendly to store our big luggage for ten days while we were out sailing in the Greek archipelago. The rooms are clean and big with god AC and lots of power outlets. God showers and toilets. The breakfast is also complete and tasty. Not the biggest breakfast selection, but plenty enough. The only bad about Areos are two things; WiFi is terrible. A bad signal in our room (202) and constantly dropping connections. I had four times faster and better connection on my mobile phone than on the hotel WiFi. So if you are depending on good WiFi this is not the hotel for you. Then we have the neighborhood. On day time it's not too shabby, but at night you would not want to walk around the blocks around the hotel. Several native Athenians we spoke to described it as a not so good neighborhood and asked us to look out for ourselves when walking in the evening. So Taxi is recommended. But as the Plaka is close it is only a €5 taxi ride to the nice Plaka and all its restaurants. Also not recommending the subway as we were almost robbed there!",1
17068,This place is absolutely breathtaking and the hot pool is amazing and the ideas that they have to entertain you are amazing but this is all overshadowed by the horrible service. The only time we got proper service was when a manager got involved. We booked a gourmet picnic for our anniversary and the waiter that assisted us acted like she was doing us a favor. The food had been left out and the salads were all wilted. The blanket that she put us on was dirty and full of ants. It really ruined our experience.   The rooms were good but I felt they were really expensive for what you get. We spent the whole week at different hotels so we could compare. Its a real shame cause the place is so beautiful and you really feel like you are in the cape town wine farms.,1

It helps having very little aircraft noise due to the very few number of aircraft arriving.   As I was in isolation for my stay at the hotel, food becomes very important. The time it takes, and the quality are all amplified by the fact you are trapped in the hotel.  Unfortunately, the food was very expensive and ordinary for was it was.

In addition, u can walk to the park in 5 mins.  - staffs are great in general Cons - room size is too small for 3 people room - air conditioning is poor and feeling humid and hot in the guest room - though the hotel is like a 4-Star ( convention / conference hotel ) the large space is not relevant to my stay - entire building and facilities are built back in early 90s which needs major renovation - swimming pool requires 4000 yen ! But the website did not mention - gym is small and old if you care",1
52559,"I was checked in speedily to a nice, sizeable room with mountain views. This place was also close to my work so it meant I could have a longer sleep in the morning which was nice. The restaurant staff were helpful and I enjoyed the food.   Everything started off so well but then some standards began to drop, I guess you could call it the domino effect. Firstly, I was awoken on my third night at 4am to the sound of a loud TV from another guest - I can't very well blame the hotel for the rudeness of another guest, but it was irritating and of course I didn't want to change rooms at such a late time in the night.   When I returned to the hotel after work, I explained that I wanted to move rooms for the upcoming night as I didn't want to risk another night of disturbed sleep. The receptionist obliged kindly and asked me to wait for 20 minutes in my room while they arranged and readied the room for me. After 1 hour and two  irritated phone calls from myself wondering why I was told to wait for so long, I was finally taken to my new seaview room. The room was fine, it was smaller than my last room, but what was annoying is that someone had clearly smoked in this room (hence why the wait time I imagine was so long). At this point, I couldn't be bothered to change rooms as I didn't want to spend another hour or so having to wait for a room change. As I was only staying one more night, I decided I'd go down to the swimming pool bar and enjoy some drinks by the pool that evening. A waitress in the restaurant showed me to my table outside and gave me a menu. Despite their being a bar outside, there was no bartender. 15 minutes later, no sign or trace of a front of house staff member could be found outside. They just decided to ignore the fact that I was outside, which really irritated me. I left the venue and explained to the restaurant manner that I was purposefully neglected and left in a huff. I thought that I'd order room service and proceeded to order a bottle of sparkling wine that I had seen on the bar menu downstairs. However, this wasn't available as room service (despite coming from the same restaurant) so I had to go back downstairs and order it and then ask for it to be sent to my room! The same restaurant manager could see that I was irritated so he sent me up the bucket of ice and glass which came after I arrived back in the room.  Despite the flaws, I did actually enjoy the hotel and realise that my review reflects mainly on the problems. However, in hindsight the hotel was still nice and spacey The food was good too - particularly the burger! I would return, I just think more attention to detail here is lacking. Please don't put non-smoking guests in smokey rooms, or at least clean the room out thoroughly and offer another room in the meantime! Funnily enough, this is the second time I've stayed at a Hyatt hotel and had to be moved to another room, only to discover that the room I'm being moved to had been smoked in!",1
25981,"I have done the Disney trip a few times before with my family. I always try to stay at serviced apartments as very convenient with the family and kids. Stayed before at the Hilton Grand Vacations and Sheraton Vistana, where I had a great experience. Unfortunately I haven’t had the same experience at the Floridays.   Upon my arrival I was informed that my apartment would be house cleaned only once during my stay and if I wanted more service I would be billed as much as 69 dollars per day.   The apartment was comfortable enough although rather old. Parking was convenient although it was clear that facilities were packed. During the night we could hear a lot of noise from vicinity and even an argument/discussion between neighbors which scared my family",1
39812,"The location of the hotel is excellent.  Few minutes walk to the myeongdong train station.  Lots of restaurants,  shopping, safe neighborhood and even though the hotel is in the center of all the hustle and bustle,  its surprisingly very quiet in your bedroom.  Breakfast was very good,  selections of hot and cold buffet.  The room is excellent in size.  Plenty to walk around.   The reason why I only gave this hotel 3 star rating was because with my encounter with the staff.  From the doorman who don't even greet you when you enter or exit the hotel,  to the restaurant staff who help themselves with coffee,  hot soups,  and juices.  C'mon guys,  guest like me can see you helping yourselves for the food that meant to be for guests.  Go to the kitchen and get your soup or drinks there away from the observant eyes of the guests. It doesn't look very professionals.   Room attendant are excellent.  My room was very clean.  A very big thank you to them. ",1

48010,"Simply awful. This was sold to us as a 5 star luxury hotel for a romantic break…It is certainly not.  The hotel is old and very dated, the restaurants bland and expensive, and no decent bars on site. The main pool is tired and dirty, there are approx 30 sun beds around it and no atmosphere.  The beach is not a typical Thai beach, it’s very tatty and has rubbish/ dead coral on it and depending on the tide is not conducive to swimming. You also have regular oil tankers sailing by as the main Phuket oil terminal is just round the corner… Nice bars/restaurants in the little village that the hotel does the shuttle bus to, eat at these and not at the hotel. Was booked in to stay for a week, it was so awful that we left after 2 nights, not soon enough. Told the manager why we were unhappy and would be leaving, but despite saying they would only charge us for the 2 nights still charged for the 3rd, another £200 ripped off by the money grabbing Panwa. I don’t often write reviews but this place is so awful I felt like a had to…avoid at all costs if you want a quality beach front hotel in Phuket.",1
4980,"Unhelpful service while we had dinner, we asked concierge if they could help us to get panadol. No 24/7 medical support.  We asked for early breakfast at 6am and the kitchen said they couldn’t n help but wanted us to call back 30 mins later. ",1
41462,"Fantastic location. house area was very nice. Breakfast was good, basically Cosco but OK to good for continental breakfast. Pretty garden area. SO why the 2 stars? The bed was horroble. Old spring mattress with a cheap pillow top cover. Slumped and could feel the springs through the cheap pillow top. The rooms and the entire house has one thermostat. So our room was very warm at night. and no screens on the windows.",1
31001,"We are frequent Las Vegas visitors. We selected Paris because of the WSOP proximity. The room was okay. There are no USB chargers in the room, but that's fine because we always bring plug-ins for travel. Overall,  the property is a little tired and darker than average. Great meals at Nobu (stupid expensive but we know that ahead of time as frequent diners) and Gorden Ramsey's place. One concern is that security was often absent at the elevators. That is, nobody checked for room keys.  To be specific, nobody was at the security station for hours at a time. Sunday, nobody was ever at the station. It wasn't that they were distracted or helping somebody away from the podium. Nobody was working at the podium - at all. Also, when security is present they only check for whether or not you have a key. Updated properties check to see that your key is active. That should be standard operating procedure. We'll be back again in LV later this month for more WSOP action but will stay elsewhere even with the convenience of the Paris location.",1
30993,"We had an over all good time! We were not happy about a couple of things! 1. When we got to our room - the queen size bed sheets were dirty with something brown, couldn’t even tell what it was. 2. Our fridge was not cooling too well and on top of that they left it dirty with an open food container in it. 3. The one thing that upset me the most was the fact that we were not able to do the water park at all, the water was freezing cold that even with Florida heat we just weren’t able to get in. This was the main reason why we booked this resort so it sucked that we were not able to enjoy it. The pizza place was good and the burger place by the water park was delicious as well! ",1

46890,"My wife and I were traveling around Greece for our honeymoon, and we stayed here for the downtown Athens leg of our trip. The first night they did not give us the room we booked, which should have had a single king-size bed. We instead got a room with 2 separate twin beds.  The front desk did nothing but give us excuses and bottle of champagne after giving us a room we didn't book, completely shutting us down on comping the room or giving us a discount on the stay.  The elevator system here is also very broken. They tried to use a destination-based system like you'd find at high-end office buildings but it is not programmed correctly so you will find the elevator waits to be extremely long sometimes.  We had another night booked at this hotel on a future date that we decided to cancel because of the bed mix-up that they refused to correct for us. They outright denied our cancellation and ignored all attempted contacts by the agency that booked the hotel. No refund on the cancelled date, but at this point I was so annoyed with the staff and the broken elevator system at this hotel it was worth paying not to stay there.",1
23337,"Graduation weekend for parents of University of Chicago means expensive hotel tabs. We stayed here about a year and a half ago just prior to the La Quintal opening. They are both owned by the same company. They were renovating exteriors then and are still in the process. The hallway doors and frames have all been replaced. Windows are new and air conditioning units have been replaced as well. Most rooms available during graduation weekend were in the $295 and up range. We booked for around $135.  As they continue to upgrade I expect prices will also go up. At some point I also expect them to upgrade the convention center they also own. The staff were 100% on top of their hospitality. All of them were friendly from the front desk, housekeeping and the guy getting the pool ready for summer. The discounted breakfast buffet in the restaurant was a good start for the day. A little walk or short cab ride to the 53rd St area and there are lots of great dining choices as well. Sat on the wall by the front desk on Friday night to catch the fireworks show from the Navy Pier for some free entertainment. If you are a super picky traveler this hotel might not be for you.  I met interesting staff and guests during our four nights. Can't wait to see what this complex looks like when they finish the entire project. As an affordable alternative for visitors to University of Chicago or Hyde Park it's a good choice.",1
45950,"They didn’t make up room Tuesday, and said it was because we had the do not disturb sign up, but that was only true for an hr in am and from 3-5 in pm. When we complained, at 5:00 they said it was too late. They asked if we needed anything and we said towels. They asked about coffee and we said yes. So when we returned from dinner they had given us small towels (no big ones) and only coffee … no clean cups or sugar! Not great! Our room was lovely and large, but had a view of an air shaft!",1

Another front desk employee, stated that ""ALL"" the rooms have the same lighting problem and that the bulbs needed were on backorder. We asked for clean face towels. Only once were these towels available. After 5 days in a dimly lit room, the fifth day as we were set to check out, a bulb was finally installed. Too little too late for us!",1
14983,Rooms are gross. Smell and full of mold. Stay away from this hotel at all costs. The ac was so loud I had to turn it off to sleep. The floors are like ice skating rinks. So much so I fell in the shower. I had to put down a towel in the shower so I wouldn’t fall again ,1
34482,"Disabled executive room so low sink and wet room, nothing executive and feels a little dingy and dirty room needs tlc. The room is noisy like a load fridge. The staff at reception are friendly and polite. Good location 8 mins from north acton station. ",1
50895,"Where to begin - DO NOT GO!!  When we arrived - the lobby looked lovely.  When we got to the room the toilet was leaking, there were bad smells, all the taps were rusted, lots of stairs and corridors (which were filthy) and no one to help/assist us to the rooms. We booked 3 rooms with two single beds in each, but gave us 3 rooms with double beds. They could not accommodate for the single beds at the time of arrival and asked to return to reception the next day. When returning to the reception the next day, they didn't have anyone to show us the rooms so gave the keys to us and we had to look ourselves. All the other rooms they showed us were still double beds, dirty and had issues.  Throughout the duration of the stay, the reception staff were not friendly, some were extremely horrid/nasty/aggressive. As the phone in the room didn't work (as well as lights, fridge, flush not working, bath filling with water, leaks in ceiling, no AC etc.), we'd have to walk to the reception every time, which would take 5-15 mins. This was done regularly as the receptionists never followed through with their promises.  The managers were having loud arguments in the dining area, blocking food I wanted. It was extremely unprofessional. There was no AC (air conditioning) in the whole hotel (lobby, rooms, dining area), completely unacceptable. The food was atrocious and there were always flies on the food. The snack bar was very bad. Soggy food, no chips, flies everywhere. No alcoholic drinks in the pool bar. Beach bar not open. No glasses (drinks were served in paper cups). No pool towels - were advised to use room towels, but were not given more towels to shower. When requesting new towels, they would not arrive for over 3 hours (if your lucky!). Rooms are not cleaned properly, sometimes dirtier than before! Lack of sockets in the room, therefore couldn't charge my electronic devices through the night. In the day electricity is off (as it requires a key card to stay on and if a key card is kept in, they remove it and take the key). The hotel is not cleaned during the day or evening, only in the morning during breakfast time, so when you wake up to put towels out on sun loungers, bins are full from the previous day, tables are dirty etc. Dining room is filthy. All tables are not cleaned when arriving. All mats are dirty. Cutlery is dirty. You have to search the dining room yourself for cutlery and cups. The waiters too struggle to find cutlery.  The entertainment is pretty awful. They do not follow the scheduled displayed on the board. By the pool, they are forceful and pushy. Everyone hurries (as advised), then the entertainment team take their time to begin the activities. They always try to save costs so do not get professionals to perform in the evenings. The team are working extremely long hours. Bebo is miserable, Malik seems inexperienced, Speedi and Hedi are keeping the entertainment team going.  It seems the entertainment team have been tasked with going around the pool and begging guests to write great reviews on TripAdvisor - this is awful! Not truthful, forceful and not pleasant when you are trying to relax by the pool. Therefore I'd say - don’t believe the good reviews because it is likely to be written by hotel staff. Pool is much smaller than pictured. Sun loungers not clean. Local alcohol is bad/rough, can make you feel unwell. Other guests (and trip advisor comments) informed me of money missing from the safe - do not use safes!  DO NOT BOOK ANY EXCURSIONS FROM ALI BABA - we booked the camel ride and pirate ship excursions and they were awful! it took 45 mins to get to the boat (where there were some 15 mins away). It looked like an abandoned ship yard, scary. The boat was dated and toilets were filthy. We were packed on the ship like sardines. The camels were all connected together. The scenery was not pleasant. It was just awful.  We found a cockroach (over 10cm long) in the room on the 2nd floor. The next day, another guest found a cockroach in the lobby toilets.  AVOID at ALL costs.  No more a 2 star.  Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at & I holiday abroad five times a year.",1

5929,"My daughter and I where on a European vacation and this was our second stop. We stayed there 3 nights. I absolutely loved the location. Close to buses, restaurants and the train station. We were given a room on the same floor as the reception desk which was great. However, due to the scaffolding on the building at the time, the scaffolding covered our room window. I returned to the receptionist desk to request a room that has a view. I was told ""none of the rooms have a view"". She said ""there is nothing to see"".  (easy for her to say - she lives there) I then asked for a room that doesn't have the window covered. The receptionist says there are no other rooms available. I would have loved to open the window to let in some natural light and taken in the atmosphere however I was unable to look out the window which gave me the feeling of being in a box. We enjoy the breakfast that was offered and the map of the city was very helpful while me made our way around the city.",1

In other Hilton unities in Europe I had one bottle/person/day but not here.... Other things that worth to be mention: - no bathrobe - no slippers - no restaurant for dinner - no bar in the lobby - sink leaking problems - the bed is located near the door and you can hear everything that moves on the floor in the morning/night  I big plus: - big balcony - location near the metro - good restaurants nearby ",1

Also, we had an incident with a man that lives there In the attic. He was incredibly rude to me and made us feel really uncomfortable. If you want to have a good holiday in Barcelona, I would advise you to find a different hotel, because this man lives there and if you have a problem with him it will ruin the whole experience.",1

The check out staff wasn’t empowered to address issues we had and then berated my guest who had her own room when she came down in his very broken English. The hotel is the worst! It smelled of Fabuloso and weed. The hot water didn’t work in my guest’s shower. Evidently there’s a truck to turning it on- no one shared that at check in. When asked got our review I wrote the GM and at $300 a night x 2 rooms I got no response Maria Meaux. So now I have no choice but to post this. Stay far away from here. It was disgusting.",1

Bathroom layout works but keep in mind is tiny in size, though clean and with fluffy white towels.

Location is fabulous to explore Paris with Metro Station and Bus stop within 3min walk. Lots of eateries and bars around for a late night snack and drinks. Special thanks to Night front desk staff, we were kindly received after hours. If you are on a budget, it works out... Just keep in mind comfort will be sacrificed a bit.",1

Taxi from Shin-Osaka Station costed nearly 3,000 Yen.  Although we requested for non-smoking room on non-smoking floor, we were given a smoking room. The staff were very unhelpful, it was either take it or leave it and forfeiting our payment. They didn't even bother to attempt to help in any way.  After we checked out, they refused to provide any assistance to contact our local guide; we couldn't even leave a message at the front counter.  My family was so upset with the experience that we didn't even bother to tour Osaka and just proceeded on to the next stage of our journey (Hiroshima).",1

I complained about noise and the party that went on all night and “Nicholas” who works nights was like “o well”. It was horrific. In the morning the woman working said I could move to a quieter floor. I don’t understand why I wasn’t on that floor before or maybe it was the smokers floor. All in all it’s been horrible. It’s not a place for families or business people. If you want to smoke in your room and play loud music it’s the place to be despite a contract you have to sign when you get there. And also the party room next to mine had another couple in there that same day, and I guess they left and I never seen anyone come and clean after the couple left. Hello coronavirus!

Pool is very small ...more communal bath and accessed via reception and therefore egress is via reception.

Maclaey road is ok but at the top descends into backpacker world with tattoo parlors and erotic shops/clubs. Good variety of restaurants close by the hotel,1
42466,"Great location in Zamalek which means it’s easy to get out of the hotel and walk some streets with beautiful buildings, good eateries, art galleries and bookshops. The hotel itself, aside from the original palace building, is 2 huge tower blocks just like the type of depressing social housing local councils built in the UK in the 1960’s.  The pool is ridiculously small for a hotel with over 1,000 beds. Just 30 sun beds poolside with further sofas and day beds one level up. It is not a restful place, with constant piped music of cheesy songs, then groups of men bringing their own portable speakers and pumping music out in competition. These groups of 4 to 6 men seem to use the pool as their pick up opportunity, with one young girl having to push past them to get into the water to avoid their persistent attentions. It’s uncomfortable viewing at times. Pool staff also are offering an unofficial booking system for sun beds. You can arrive as the pool opens at 8am only to be asked to move away from beds that have been ‘pre-booked’ yet remain unoccupied for hours, presumably by guests busy out on tours.  Staff at the garden promenade cafe are adept at avoiding eye contact when you wish to order or pay in any decent timescales. Service is universally slow in this hotel despite huge numbers of staff walking around.  Do not use the concierge services to order a taxi, we were completely ripped off and charged 500 LE for a quick return ride to Tahrir Square. Instead walk out of the Zamalek Tower and past Harry’s Pub and get a taxi off the street by the back gate. Same journey is LE 40 each way! Or use Uber…Marriott Mena House staff much more helpfully ordered our return last night for just 110 LE for a 40 minute journey after having dinner there in front of the Pyramids.

After 4 hours i got fed up waiting and went to complain to receptionist and room was sudenly ready.  When using the  shower the water ran in the opposite from the drain which leaked through the shower door and flooded the bathroom and bedroom floor.On the saturday there was a beach party that blasted music till about 4am,this kept the whole hotel awake and led numerous complaints which were ignored.On the sunday we had heavy rain that led to my room getting flooded through a faulty seal at the bottom the sliding  doors,the fix for this was to send up 2 housemaids with towels and they used my room rugs along the bottom of the veranda doors. On the monday i went for a walk on the beach, either side of the hotel beach there were 2 dead rats, tourists were photographing these vermin.Not a good advert for sousse beach.The main road parralel with the beach front has more derelect buildings than occupied ones , this place is a dump.The food is mostly cold and bland and by the time the waiter brings your drinks you've finished your meal or it's to cold to eat.you can't  walk anywhere without  weirdos and dodgy looking guys following you or trying to get cash out of you,it's even worse near the medina.Save your money avoid this country  like the plague.",1
38742,"The best thing about this hotel was the location - very close to everything including metro stop, Termini, and Trevi fountain.  Good restaurants and gelato nearby, plus a supermarket.  It’s hard to find a room for a family of 5 in central Rome for a reasonable price, and we were quite comfortable and had plenty of room (2 adults, 1 teen, and 2 kids).  The elevator is small - two people at a time - but it’s the largest that could be retrofitted into the building and I was glad not to walk up 6 flights of stairs!  The room was very clean and quiet - we did not see or hear any other guests during our 8 nights.  We stayed over Easter and they left a lovely basket of candies and pastries in our room for Easter Sunday (see photo).  The bathroom - often had a sewer smell that must be from old plumbing and unavoidable.  It was also narrow - only one person at a time for sure.  But again - old building and unavoidable.  I was a little disappointed in the breakfast - having stayed in many other European hotels with a breakfast, I was accustomed to a small breakfast room with staff making food, fresh cheese/meats, cereals, yogurts, and such.  In this case, there were beverages in the fridge and assorted packaged pastries on the counter.  We did not starve of course, but it was different than other European hotels so I want to mention it.  Overall we would most certainly stay here again - it was safe, clean, and well-located.  ",1

3631,"We had several issues with this hotel.  The pictures online make the hotel look like a gorgeous resort.  Spoiler alert: it doesn't look anything like the pictures.  It's very old and dirt.  It also isn't anywhere near the beach in a beach town, and you have to take a ten minute shuttle to get to the beach.  As I mentioned, this hotel is very very old and dirty.  It looks like they haven't put any money into it in 30 years to fix it up.  Our room was a fine size, but I have nothing else positive to say about it.  In the room we found mosquitoes.  There was dust everywhere.  The bathroom mirror was filthy.  I complained to the front desk manager who was of no assistance at all and incredibly rude.  We tried to make the best of it and make plans for the day and night.  We went to the concierge to ask about what the town has to offer.  First off, she barely spoke english and was on her phone the whole time.  She was able to show us posters and pamphlets for a few tour options, but couldn't help with any follow up questions at all.  We asked about timing of different events, distance to areas in the town, etc, and she did not know the answer to any of these inquiries.  I was under the impression this was the concierge's responsibility.   Breakfast was also nearly inedible.  There were flies all over the food and awful service.  For the price you can absolutely find better accommodations.  We will be back to Thailand eventually, but we will absolutely avoid this hotel.",1

57156,"I had initially made a reservation for a room to accommodate two adults and a child for a six-night stay. However, the reservation was canceled as babies were not allowed in that particular room. Consequently, I had to book a different and more expensive room that included an additional attached room.  Later on, I decided to book only the last night of my stay at this hotel to experience the larger room and see what the hotel had to offer. To my surprise, the room I was given turned out to be the same room as the one I had originally booked, without the promised additional room. This discrepancy left me shocked and disappointed.  Due to this experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend this place to others.",1
46069,I had contact this hotel many weeks in advance to make sure we had airport transfers and was confirmed yes.  We arrive no one there call was told oh he is on the way.  20 minutes later where is he oh there was a accident mind you this hotel is supposed to be 9 miles from airport long story short after numerous calls a driver finally came.  The man at front desk was dry rude unapologetic (Has mustache) Hotel is smoke and mirrors of what it really is.  Had the honeymoon suite for our 10 year anniversary they left a cheap red wine everything in fridge was charged to us.  Complementary breakfast scrambled eggs cold bacon under cooked stayed 3 nights at that once.  Rooms out dated no tissues no wash clothes these weird linen hand towels.  Location was made as close to Spanish steps not really close to anything had to take a cab everywhere.  They were great getting you a cab fast.  For what they charged this was not worth it!  Claim they have a bar no.  Bar no one there.  Claimed restaurant no again except for breakfast.  They should not portray their hotel as they do and how we had to arrive and treated big deal breaker would not recommend.,1
28755,"We were booked into the hotel by Emerald Cruises prior to a trip up the Danube.   On the plus side, food at the on site restaurants is decent, beds are clean and comfortable, and wifi is quite good. Location is pretty good.   On the downside, very disorganized. We were given one room (445) and noticed it did not match the number on our paperwork (455). Traipsed back down to registration, then back up to move our suitcases to another room. No offer of assistance. Half the elevators not working.   Rooms are fairly small, one functional chair and another at the desk that is great for leaning back so far you can nearly touch the back of your head to the floor. I flunked gymnastics, so prop it up against the wall when I sit in it.   The decor in the room reminds my of Spartan Soviet:  A couple of odd prints and a mirror on a blank wall. We had one towel, called the front desk for another, and no one ever showed up. I commandeered a couple more from a housekeeper working down the hall. Furniture and fixtures in common areas are worn, and brightwork is in need of a good cleaning.   Definitely not the worst place we have ever stayed, but definitely in the bottom 10%.  Not sure what Emerald Cruises was thinking.",1
63775,"I stayed in hotel for three days for a leisure tour of the city. When I made the booking on the internet,  I was surprised by the relatively cheap rates of the hotel compared to  those in other big cities in China, and also other five star hotels in Nanjing. After staying in the hotel for a few days, I can certainly understand why.  This Sofitel has very good facilities like other Sofitel hotels elsewhere . The suite that I was staying in on level 45 was nicely appointed and tastefully decorated, with abundant space and a great view of the city. The room was clean, and it was made up more than once a day if I had to return to the hotel room a few times during the day.   I used the large swimming pool a few times and the facilities at the change room were excellent. However, as it was the hottest time in summer, the pool was busy even after 9 pm. During the day, there were always scores of  children frolicking in the pool, so lap swimming may be challenging.  As this is an indoor pool with  a sunroof, it did get quite warm around the pool in daytime.  Otherwise the pool is one of the best indoor hotel pools that I have used.  The gymnasium also appeared well equipped. However I did not use it as I was already sweating a lot just from stepping outside the hotel and waiting for a cab.  The location of the hotel is on the perimeter of the inner city. As it is not within walking distance to any subway station, getting around without hailing a cab in the stifling heat is not possible. However, during peak hours, it could be quite challenging to get a cab. You either venture out in the street in oppressive heat to compete with locals for a cab, or even if you manage to get a cab, chances are you get stuck in the traffic going no where fast.   There are two restaurants in the hotel, one Chinese and one Japanese. I had one buffet dinner which was part of a South East Asian food promotion. Even though there was a good variety of food, the quality was rather disappointing. It was definitely below what one would expect from a five star international restaurant. Perhaps the clientele was almost all local and they were not so demanding.   There is an executive floor for Sofitel club members. However, if one is not a club member, it costs around $ US$ 60 for the use of the facilities for one day, which includes breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks in the evening. I think it is quite a big hit as that is more than half of the room rate that I paid for.  It is a pity that a highly regarded hotel with good facilities and professional staff is somewhat let down by its location and to some extent, the rather ordinary food.",1
31080,"So disappointed in this place. So we stayed here because they have pet friendly rooms. Once we checked in, we headed up to our room on the fifth floor. As we approach the hallway to our room, it reeked of cat urine. Luckily, by the time we got to our room the smell had dissipated. Unfortunately, when we opened our door to our room, we were instantly met with the smell of dog urine. At first I wasn't too upset about it because I know it's a pet room and it's bound to happen. But what really upset me was after looking around the room, we noticed dog urine all over the bottom of the bed and the bottom of the curtains in the room. The problem with this (besides it being disgusting) is that they charge you a huge premium to stay in these rooms. I'm talking double the price. We paid $1200 to stay here for two nights, which was double what we were quoted for a regular room before we decided to bring our dog. What's infuriating to me is at this price, the damn room should be clean. They also only allow two people to be hooked up to the Internet, which is useless. We lost our Internet connection the entire time we were here. We also checked in as a party of four, and we're given three bath towels. I know that's a minor thing, but it was just the icing on the cake. No attention to detail and a dirty room. I have stayed at nicer pet friendly best westerns for a fraction of the cost. The casino and restaurants are cute and fun, But I would not stay here again because of the room.",1
43039,"It's overpriced for what it is and I had to fight for a 30 minute late checkout. I only stay here because of location but will check out the Westin next time.  Also, BEWARE of the ATM in Starbucks, I got a FAKE 100RMB!",1
49975,"This hotel has the potential to be a great hotel. We got the larger family room and it is a great size. Lots of room. The balcony was great too.  The sewer smell in the bathroom, however, ruined it. It’s septic tank, and the smell comes through the drains. Staff tried to fix it, but nothing can be done. Our bathroom fan wasn’t working either which didn’t help. I identified the issue pretty soon after we checked in. We were told an electrician would come that day. Nothing. The next day was Sunday and apparently they don’t come that day and was told by the manager that they would come the next day. Still nothing. Very frustrating. Really gross and we were brushing our teeth outside of the bathroom to avoid the smell. Ridiculous.  Additionally, by booking was straight through the hotel website. My confirmation indicates 12pm checkout. Reception indicates 11:30am. Another annoying inconsistency.   The manager is not on site and I had to talk to her over the phone. She indicated that she would include our breakfast in our rate, which is fine, but doesn’t solve the bathroom issue. Very uncomfortable in the room due to this. Didn’t seem like they really cared, honestly.  Overall, the hotel is nice. Lots of stairs but that’s Santorini. Some rooms have less private balconies and almost look like public seating areas. So be aware when booking.",1
41280,Nicely appointed room but you have to unplug the illuminated head board to sleep as no switch. Some of the artwork might not be suitable for children as contains modern nudes Reception and valet really helpful. Bar and food service seemed a little understaffed so slow. Very nice salt water pool and bar service outside. About 25 feet from the beach and plenty of chairs and loungers. The duty management managed to mess up our anniversary Dinner we had contacted them about before we arrived so we ended up going to a nearby  Restaurant. ,1
39024,"The main reason I booked this apartment was the advertised 10 minute walk to the MRT. Having stayed close by before, I figured it was probably more like 15 but this farther from Orchard Road than the map suggests. It took more like 40 minutes. I could have put up with that if not for the unfriendly staff and other 'little' things like, no pool towels, borderline rude response to my query about a gluten free breakfast option, difficulty in obtaining an extra towel, the oven not working, the tile floor being softer than the beds, the list goes on. On the plus side, it was clean. And there was only a minor difficulty in getting a refund (which will take 6 weeks for unknown reasons) when we decided to change hotels 2 days into our 7 day trip. If you know to pack your own towels, don't expect to actually be able to cook in your apartment and are willing to either walk or get a taxi every time you want to eat something more than a snack and have no dietary needs then this would probably be quite a reasonable place to stay.",1

53885,"I read such great reviews I'm very disheartened to report otherwise.  Cons- Staff was pretty rude and unaccommodating to me probably because I'm not asian. Refused to give extra towels, and on the last day they said they didn't have any fresh towels ?  Linens were torn and distressed. The pool has loose tiles which are a hazard. Sauna is out of service same with the jacuzzi. The pool is unmanned so you cannot ask anyone for help.   Pros the location is just perfect, the room cleaners are very diligent and do their job well. The property is walking distance from all the hot spots in Thonglor. The view from the pool is pretty beautiful and it's peaceful and nice.",1
45463,"My wife and I were part of the Tauck Tours to Japan to see the Cherry Blosooms and we decided to arrive a few days early for our own private pre-tour of Osaka. The Ritz Carlton Osaka (RCO) is a luxurious 5 star hotel with all the amenities you could ask for.  There are several restaurants housed within RCO making it very convenient to choose dining at these high end restaurants.  Splendido is Italian, however, since we were in Japan, we wanted to try Japanese cuisine on our first night in Osaka. But, at Splendido,  breakfast is a good option providing a buffet and ala carte menu. If you are not big breakfast eaters, Ala Carte is the way to go as the cost is quite high for buffet.   If you are not comfortable with left hand driving, as Japan is like the British system using shuttle and taxis is the way to go. Taxi's are queued up at the front of SCO for really easy and secure selection of taxi cabs and reliable drivers to and from your hotel. Check to be sure, that they accept credit cards, best way to conserve you Yen for other travel purposes.   Toilet are TOTO, our first introduction to the high tech world of a toilet seat greeter upon entrance to the compartmentalized toilet area. If you choose, you can get an automatic sprinkle wash of your bottom with a warm soothing water spray with a variety of water pressures. What we didn't know is that most of Japan has move to a total ""TOTO"" approach, including public areas of transportation and most high end establishments. Looks like this is going to put a dent in the toilet paper industry!  Our room had a great view of the harbor being on the 30th floor with spectacular morning and evening views.   We came for the Cherry Blossoms and sad to say, Osaka experienced an extreme cold snap a few weeks before loosing most of it's blossoms. However, if you look far and near you will find some trees with a variety of floral colors. On our first day, we went up to the garden area and found one tree with a few blossoms!    We realized that this might just be a indication of what's was to come...Little or No Cherry Blossoms!",1

Poorly maintained - wc flush broke twice in one room, drain/sewer smell in bathrooms, shower head held on with sellotape in another room, our room door lock flimsy and coming away from the doorframe.  Mass confusion with our booking with reception ringing us to say we had to check out when we'd even paid in advance for another night. Then they insisted we have new room keys as computer said no.

33643,"I had a very bad experience staying in this hotel due to communication breakdown and bad manners of the staff.  My family and I booked for a stay of 8 nights here, the check in process was okay but we had to do a room swap after going to the rooms due to miscommunication (apparently it didn’t happen).  During our 2nd night of our stay, it was a nightmare as I returned to the hotel really late close to midnight and was unable to access the room.  So I proceeded to the front desk for assistance but was approached by staff named Iizumi & Maeda and I was really taken aback by Iizumi really bad manners.  I was told that I’m required to do a room change due to the initial room type I stayed is fully sold out during our stay period, and they have already moved our belongings to the new room which I then reconfirmed with Maeda for 3 times to ensure what I have heard is correct.  I also explained that I have requested for the room swap from my check in agent but Iizumi immediately gave me the reaction of doubting my claims and then proceed to speak more rudely and challenged me to name the staff that checked me in for about 3 times before I answered him and even told me that I should not listen to the staff as the information is incorrect & not to trust her words. After I was able to provide him with the check in agent named - Ko, he gave me a shocked expression as he was not expecting me to remember then spoke to me in a nicer manner.  I was told to pay an additional charge if I want to remain the room which I refuse, given the lousy service.  After the entire saga, I was asked to wait for a new room as they do not currently have any clean room then was told that they would extend my original room as a gesture due to the timing (already past midnight) and required to make a room change the next morning.  I am really disappointed by the service and I would not recommend this hotel to my family and friends.  However, I would like to compliment Iwase for being very friendly and helpful after the incident for the remaining of our stay.",1

Several days before my arrival to Dubai, I get a message saying that my reservation was cancelled! I frantically emailed the hotel several times asking if there was anything I could do, with no response. I was left during a busy holiday time with no hotel and marked up prices due to the holidays. I suspect they charged much more money for the next guest for the room (we had booked in advance through a deal they were having at the time). Overall, horrible and stressful experience. Avoid this hotel.",1
26580,"This hotel is a little tired and nothing like the photos! Rate it at 3* maximum There were lots of little things missing and the odd maintenance wouldn't go amiss. The staff were helpful and polite with the odd exception! Sadly we visited during Ramadan so most of Sousse was closed up, but it was so evident that a lot of money is needed to finish all the unfinished buildings and demolish all the derelict ones. The derelict ones either side of the hotel just made hotel feel so poor! This was apparent not just in the town area but also when we went on a trip out. The money is spent on preserving all the heritage sites which are great and worth a look. For this three day visit is enough, a week is too long.  In a whole week, there was no entertainment bar one evening when there was someone playing traditional music in the bar for an hour or so. No board games and few books to while away the hours of nothing else to do. The food was plentiful but exceptionally repetitive. The deserts horribly sweet and dry. The best thing was the fresh strawberries.  The rooms were just adequate, nothing like the luxurious ones on the photos. The tv, hardly worked and only BBC news. Wi-Fi in rooms awful,not great when necessary to access internet for work.  Will not be returning ant time soon. Very disappointing. Was hoping for some winter sun and a little warmth. Sadly picked the wrong week, rain, rain and not a lot to do, and just one days sunshine, which the lobster Brits took advantage of and will regret for the rest of time!!",1
42564,"I had booked the executive room, which on their website was shown as a big, bright, airy and lovely room. Exactly the type you want to stay in after a long travel from Europe.   We arrived after 18.00 (6pm) and was greeted nicely by the man in the reception. I paid the remaining two nights (we had booked three nights) and were shown to our room. Room? It was closer to a walk in closet than a room. It was dark, small and not in ANY WAY resembling the room we had booked. I complained right away and told them that we could not stay in that room. It is not what we had booked, nor did it provide us what we needed.  We were offered a glas of wine while the man spoke to the manager. There was no other room available and I had to find a new hotel. We were given the payment for the two nights back, there and then.   Surprise, surprise when I get my bank statement a few weeks later. Not only did I receive a ""no show"" letter from Booking.com (which was not true since we were there), they had also charged us for the two nights - despite paying it back earlier. We complained but since we had not ""taken a picture of the room we were given"", we cold not prove the situation and therefore they did not pay anyting back.   So do not trust the pictures at the hotel website. They must have one room looking like this, but the remaining ones certainly does not look loke that one. Shameful and very, very frustrating!

The water and ice machines don't work, the elevators look like something out of a horror movie and there's still one broken.   As for the room, my criticism is not about the size.  After all, it's an Ibis and the rooms are small, that's part of the expectation.   The problem is appearance and usability.  Outdated room, with the smallest TV I've seen in years!  The air conditioning, despite working, is extremely noisy and smells weird. The bathroom too, with the ventilation system having seen better days.   At least everything was clean and the pillow was extremely comfortable.   The final perception is that the hotel has stopped in time, at least 20 years.

( $410+ without breakfast )The rooms are nothing like it looks, pretty outdated. The room doesn’t have any sea view like they have shown( we have booked sea view ). No toothpaste and brush available ( imagine ) Old pool. The entire hotel is outdated. The AC is fixed at 22 degrees C. Also I can’t control and I believe it’s not working at all. Location is bad. I had some idea about this but I thought other things would make for it. You can get a much better deal else where. I have come often to this part of Thailand! ",1
64120,staying for 7days. It was quiet and comfortable. TV channels are sufficient  wifi network speed was ine checkin/checkout procedures were fast.  The food was average. An ertra afternoon snack was presented on Friday.  800hkd per day,1
48343,Large clean modern rooms. Expensive breakfast not included in the already high priced rooms. Hotel dinner at the hotel restaurant are very small portions also at high price and not that well made in relation to the price. So we only tried the dinner once. The hotel staff cleaned the rooms but did not change wet and used towels so we had to ask for new. Unpleasantly treated at checkout which gave me a sour taste for the place.,1

28967,"If you are looking for a big downtown hotel with luxurious appointments and tons of attentive service, stay somewhere else.  If you are looking for a convenient city center location, a beautiful old building repurposed as a unique small hotel with an artsy urban vibe, this may be the place for you.  I really liked the more intimate feel, the classic architecture and very cool bar at the entrance to the hotel.  I also enjoyed the comfortable beds, good quality breakfast and outstanding location for our needs on this trip.  We were looking for a Marriott property that was an easy walk from both Union Station and the CTA Blue line.  It is only a few blocks from both.  I was able to use my Suite Night Awards to upgrade to a larger room than standard.  It was very spacious but this used to be automatic without using Suite Night Awards.  Now the reasons for only three stars.  This was probably the worst water pressure we’ve ever experienced in a supposedly world class hotel.  I am home today and can’t wait to shower in my own bathroom the finally get all soap out of my hair.  The pressure at the W was that bad!   This was my first Marriott stay since reaching Titanium Elite.  In lieu of the executive lounges which remain closed indefinitely (I have my doubts that Marriott will ever reopen them), they offer breakfast at whatever venue the hotel has to serve it for elite members Platinum and above.  This hotel offered me a very ungenerous $10 pp toward their expensive breakfasts average about $30 pp.  We could have eaten in the city for less without their $10.  This annoyed me but the thing that really pissed me off was they didn’t explain to me that I had to ask the server for our $10 pp credit at breakfast or else they wouldn’t know and will charge full price.  What?!!  They really can’t come up with a way to automatically credit it like almost every European Marriott owned property?!  Go back to the stupid paper vouchers if you have to.  Whatever it takes!    Marriott management, you really need to pay attention to these comments.  I am a very seasoned traveler and understand better than most what a difficult year this has been for the hotel industry.  But I also have the experience of other brands (the one you’d care about is Hilton) and know they are handling these pandemic times MUCH better than you.  Do better or you will find that when it is all over, many of your most loyal customers like me will have defected to another brand.",1
2738,The Hostel is very Modern and the location had the best part for me. I can catch a train or bus very close to the hostel and this gives me more comoditty. Only thing i didnt liked a lot was about the bathroom. The size of the shower part is very small compartiy with anothers locals And the rooftop of the bathroom that had a lot of mold.,1
58013,"The property is really nice! this is not the problem. In my opinion, this hotel requires more professional or better-trained staff members, there were too many mistakes made that same day: - A long wait for a simple salad and club sandwich at the lounge, wrong food was delivered again more time waiting...and I finally had to cancel...but then no apologies from the lounge manager at the time, he preferred to send the waitress... this is unacceptable! - Very dirty fitness center, no water, and no wipes... - Waited in my room for 25 minutes to get more soap and shower gel",1
16907,"We stayed here for 3 nights, getting 1 double and 1 triple room, both non-smoking.  The double room was cozy enough for 2 people: a queen-sized bed (which can almost fit 3) + room for our luggage and a small couch and a table for coffee and meals. But the triple room was quite cramped for 3: it was basically a double room with the queen-sized bed replaced with 3 single beds.  The rooms and its amenities were both very clean and the hotel housekeeping kept it that way daily. WiFi connection is good. The bathroom was indeed small (I'm Asian BTW, so I'm guessing for Westerners it would be really small). But what it lacked in size, it made up in its toiletries: everything's provided and they even use Shiseido for the soap/shampoo/body wash. Same goes for the amenities for the entire room (towels, slippers, teapot, bathrobes, dryer, etc.). The only thing missing was a safe, which means always bringing your valuables with you or leaving it at the front desk.  As for the neighborhood, there isn't much to see. There are a couple of convenience stores and a Don Quixote (duty-free shop) near the hotel, which is good. But most of the other places are closed at night (except for the love hotels and some establishments which I think offer ""special services""). So as a suggestion, if you like walking around aimlessly to take in the sights, do that in the main area of Osaka, then just come back here to sleep.  As for accessibility, the hotel is not situated in a convenient location. We purchased a JR Pass for our train rides in Kyoto/Osaka but the only near station is Juso, which does not service JR lines. So we always had to buy tickets from Juso to go to other stations. The station is about 5-10mins away from the hotel and the other stations we needed to go to (Osaka, Umeda, Kawaramachi, etc.) are not that far.",1
65906,A few misses in service and TV quality made paying the high price’s painful.  Restaurant was too crowded causing staff to rush and make mistakes.  Hire more staff or lower prices.  I probably won’t stay again unless there’s a discount involved.,1
46991,"Oh where to start. The constant mistakes and small annoyances began to add up. If I could ask for a refund I would. Without calling anyone out, the female reception staff members are are all great. Everyone else is completely unprofessional, seemingly very uneducated and lacks basic English skills. It is not worth a long time stay. The hotel is very dated and the food is not very good. Go to Hilton down the road for a far better experience.",1
25597,"The night porter was probably the best thing about our stay: always pleasant. Unlike the reception staff who are pretty curt to the point of rudeness. They seem to have a stock answer of ‘no’ for everything.    The Deluxe King rooms are a good size, but the bathroom is badly set out with a heavy sliding door that offers little privacy, only one hook for hanging towels or clothes, and very, very bad water pressure.  The lounge bar and restaurant are closed on Mondays so there is absolutely no food or drink services of any kind available which, quite frankly, is just ridiculous. This was our second stay of several nights and, even though we’re iPrefer members, probably our last stay. Many things going for this hotel, but the staff and standards are not amongst them.",1
49662,"Stayed at hotel skypark Dondaemun from 1-12 Dec 2022. It’s supposedly a 4 star hotel as listed when we booked the accommodation.  Positive (1) Hotel is strategically located near the Rail station and there are shopping centers nearby with cafe/ shops selling good quality food (eg Isaac toast, coffee) at reasonable price. There’s a CU ( equivalent of a 7-eleven) at level 14 where the reception counter is located.  (2) Generally the room is clean and comfortable   Negative (1) Hotel WiFi is so unstable that we got to resort to using data from roaming. Asked the front desk and the response was ‘that’s the best they can do.’  (2) on one occasion after housekeeping was done, we found a stain on the blanket that is supposedly washed. To the hotel’s credit, their manager on duty came and apologized and changed the soiled blanket for us as the housekeeping staff is off for the day  (3) Laundry at the hotel was problematic. There are 3 washers with only 2 dryers so there was always a lot of waiting when other guests are also doing their laundry. The dryer does not work when the hot air option was selected yet there is no signage cautioning guest against using. We only found out after inserting cash for the drying only to find out that the clothes are not dry at all.  (4) toothbrushes/ toothpaste are not included as part of the cost so please bring along your own. Toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, body lotion was provided though  For a 4 star hotel I definitely would expect more so I would only rate it 2 stars for my review. To put it plainly, I will not book this hotel again for my next trip to Seoul.",1
40522,"No hangers, no iron. AC was not working. I know it was not the hotel’s fault but there was continues black outs on one night. A plus was the front desk was helpful and answered any questions I had regarding the hotel and things to do around the hotel.",1

Towels and toiletries provided and replaced each time the room was cleaned by the housekeepers. (Who weren't intrusive at all!)

Even taught us the metro system and arranged our taxi to the airport at the end of our stay which was extremely helpful! Walking distance from metro, Sagrada and La Pedrera with 24hr supermarkets and quaint local restaurants/cafes just down the street.

Wifi a little slow at peak times in the evening however all in all a comfortable and safe stay in the heart of Barcelona!",1

The pool guy who is also a breakfast guy was very hard working, nice fellow, no complains there. The cleaning ladies were also friendly and doing their job without any negative remarks.",1

17168,Good breakfast selection. Watch out for dirty sheets. Left in dark room as all the lights went off in the room. I received no sympathy from the receptionist. I did not received a  TORCH to lighten the room.  Ironing room is a joke- not working when room is too cold.,1
19644,"This place has horrible customer service. Be prepared to wait to be able to check into your room.

The rooms are nice but that is the only good thing about the place .I accidentally left my iPad by the pool and when I went back to get it it was already gone. I kept checking the location and trying to get help from the hotel staff to locate it. However, the entire time they had it in their office and had no intention of giving it back to me. The only reason we got it back was because my husband got into their office and demanded it back. This place has a bunch of shady folks working there. So do not trust them with any of your things. I would not recommend the Grove to anyone. ",1
31003,The room was an undated Burgundy room with a nice bathroom. However the rest of the hotel from carpets to tile floors were filthy. The elevator floors were disgusting. Our shoes stuck to the floor. We were with our teenage daughters and they asked to leave immediately. If you go stay in the nice casinos and off of the Strip. It is a homeless lowlife  S’hole.

There are also construction works in front of the hotel. I personnally suggest hotels at city center for easier connections.

52382,"The rooms are adequate with the usual amenities and furniture.  What is not normal is there are no bottles of water unless you choose not to have your bed linens changed!  The staff and cleaners are very efficient and extremely polite as the culture of Japan dictates.  The breakfast is substantial but I really missed the fruits as the fruits are of the frozen variety and a small bowl where after you scooped, you seem to have taken all the fruit!  What I find really uncomfortable is that the cooked eggs are cold (from the fridge)!!  I have to soak them in hot water or soup so as not to eat chilled cold eggs.   Location wise, this hotel is strategically placed - there is a huge supermarket nearby, food streets just a few minutes walk and the Railway Station is 10 mins.  The underground station is 5 mins.  It is very convenient especially to/fro airport where the airport express rail is cheap and very regular.  You cant miss the terminal stop of Namba Railway station.",1
9274,"I have stayed in this hotel before for work conferences, so I was happy to stay again prior to an early SickKids appointment with my child.  Unfortunately, the room was so disappointing, especially for the amount paid.  - Lighting was an issue throughout the whole room -- so many power cords, whcih were old; exposed wires on a few of them, outlets not properly attached to the walls, lights flickered constantly. - Bathroom issues - counter was detaching from the wall, toilet did not flush properly, stained tub, sink faucet leaked. - Room cleanliness - it's a minor thing, but the bed skirts were so stained.  My issue lies only with the room. The wervice was great at the front desk with check in and parking. ",1
12176,"We visited the SkyCity Marriott on 24 December en-route to London with a 4 week old newborn. We arrived after 5pm and our flight to London is midnight on Christmas. Firstly they told us we cannot extend our room stay as the hotel is fully booked, even the we pleaded with them that we have a newborn and will need somewhere to be for 8 hours after checkout. We were happy to pay but they wouldn’t do anything to assist. Their attitude was like, too bad.  After getting to our room, we decided to visit the Velociry Bst and Grill for a quick bite to eat. We asked for a kids penne pasta with nothing but a bit of Parmesan cheese on the side. The pasta was small and dripping in butter. We were charged over AUD $25 for this dish, which was the same as their pasta dish with cherry tomatoes and a basil pesto sauce. I argued with the manager that the price shouldn’t be the same for pasta and butter, but he refused to assist in the slightest. In fact, I found him (his name is Raymond) to be particularly rude and very unhelpful.  We usually stop en-route to London via Singapore. We have never had a bad experience there and every hotel we have been to is reasonably priced and very helpful.  One thing for certain is that I would never, ever stay at this hotel again and I urge anyone who is thinking of booking and who doesn’t want to get totally ripped off, to steer clear!   Two thumbs down for this Marriott. A very poor show, and the least you could have done was try and assist a customer!",1

46502,"The positives a) Centrally Located - walking distance from Bus stops and atleast 2 subway stations. It has 711 and other convenience stores around the hotel. b) Lovely view - overlooking Hyde Park, c) personnels manning the reception were very courteous and tried the best they could, but the hotel was only a Motel  Issues - a) Service - the room we checked in had a broken cabinet shelf. For the 4 days we stayed- it wasn't properly repaired. This is after daily calls and 2 visit by the carpenter. who comes by 9 am and leaves promptly at 4.45 pm. On the 4th day the soap in dispenser got over. Rather than filling it, another bottle was just kept in the room. Using it became very cumbersome, while having a bath.  b) We were offered breakfast on the house. However, what we got was 2 slices of bread each (we were 3), an orange juice, and some pre cut fruit in sugar syrup. so, we ended up spending extra daily for our breakfast too. c) there was a gas top too, but without any utensils there was no use of it.  d) the quality of liquid soap was of a very low quality.",1

Nothing like the pictures they present            - they didn't want to give us our money back, but they offer another room            - terrible noise starting at 9 a.m. ending in the evening because they were renovating some rooms            - the rooms for massage, sauna and baths were not finished",1

I am the type that can sleep through almost anything but even I woke up quite a few times. -No elevators -Breakfast...it is included in the room which is nice...however you cannot go in to retrieve your own food, the front desk does it.  I heard they have Starbucks coffee which is probably nice if you are a coffee drinker.  The menu is quite small (hard-boiled eggs, toast, cereal, oatmeal).  I ordered an English muffin and watched the front desk employee with his bare hands (no gloves) open my English muffin and put it in the toaster.  He did take it out with tongs but I wasn't eating it at that point.

13632,"Place is a joke - booked a room for 6, got a room for 4 at check in at 6pm, so back to reception, told us they had no rooms with sofa beds ready for an hour, so we had to wait an hour to change rooms, then lug 6 sets of luggage to a new room with no offer of help (altho we booked for 1 night, we had luggage for a 15 night holiday). The new room had 2 double beds and a sofa. Rang reception at 8pm to ask for them to bring bedding and to make up the sofa bed, pointing out we’d already waited over an hour to be given a room for 6 of us. They knew we’d travelled since 6am UK time (1am their time) and had young children and needed to sleep. Nothing by 9pm, so went to reception again to complain in person, was told they’d send someone straight away. Waited in the room another half an hour - nothing!! So then went to reception to complain again at 9.30, unbelievably they had housekeepers sorting other rooms for other guests due to check in....they totally could not cope. I found the manageress abrupt, rude and condescending who did nothing that she promised she would -  she promised to ring me when I asked about a gesture of goodwill - she never did, when I asked her in person a second time, she told me she’d been too busy to ring, but had made a goodwill gesture by giving us another room - ie the room I’d booked it n the first place so that was nonsense and showed her complete lack of ability, empathy and common sense - when I complained at 9.30 for a third time (or 4th including the wrong room complaint) she promised she’d bring the bedding herself, she never did, and after another half an hour I ended up going out into the corridors and finding a housekeeper and getting sheets and pillows and made up the sofa bed myself, including having to remove the dirty sheets already in the sofa bed, a pleasant find - not - after I worked out how to open up the sofa bed. Just what sort of place allows you to book for 6 people and think it’s normal to provide beds for 4 people?????????? It was gone 10pm by then (3am UK time and 21 hours after we had started our travel). We were all so exhausted and miserable - they ruined the one night we had in Miami. The manageress was totally incompetent and is losing that hotel business. A joke. ",1
13113,"We started an experience at the hotel that couldn't have been worse!!!!  I and my boss is having a business trip to Korea.  We arrived at the hotel at 3 pm, and there was no one to greet us in the hotel lobby, NO BELLMAN, even we wait at the hotel gate for a while to find help. We had a hard time carrying three heavy suitcases inside the hotel lobby- where NO WELCOME, NO ONE SAYS HI, just a crowed lobby.  Not stopping there, there was no space left to rest in the lobby - and of course, not a single staff member cared that I have to stand up with high heel in the lobby. A female employee asked me to fill in my full name on an iPad full of Korean and did not explain or guide us the purpose or explain how to check in. Until we complained to 2 men who looked like managers in the hotel lobby, we were asked to wait another 10 minutes to check-in- which actually is to line up in check in line.  The next bad experience was that after nearly 10 minutes in check-in line; the front desk could not find our booking even though our agent had called the hotel few minutes before and checked in advance to make sure there was a room ready for us. I would like to emphasize again that it is now 3:30 pm. And of course, no one apologize (or even mention) for our late check in.   After connecting FO staff to our agent via phone, we got our key. Then, We spent another 5 minutes talking to a staff member who couldn't speak basic English. When I asked, ""Is there anyone carrying our suitcases to the room, or will we bring them ourselves?"" She just kept saying ""Okay, Okay, Okay"" until we impatiently asked, ""Okay, what?"" then she said ""Okay"" again...  Finally (we hope), we got into the room - a room with dirty, stained sheets, torn pillows, and every welcome/instruction paper in the room had yellow spots,  wrinkled or placed in the opposite reading direction (as you can see clearly in the pictures I attached). It really felt like checking into a 3-star motel in some underdeveloped suburban province.  I chose this hotel because it has good reviews and belongs to a popular Korean brand name and seemed to be always crowded, but the experience I had was really terrible and below common hotel standard.   I wonder if this is NORMAL for a 5-star hotel? Or is the hotel crowded so that they don't need guests anymore?  I also work in the 5-star hotel industry - in a less developed country than Korea, but our 3* hotel in the city center is better than this.  I WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO THIS HOTEL- Korea is really amazing from the moment I arrived at the airport with fresh air and friendly people, great food - if  I hadn't booked a room here, this trip would be perfect!",1

I’m here for work couldn’t wait.. woke up next day toilet clogged twice a day toilet was clogged you cannot get an actual person that works there to speak with unless you wait in line for 1-2 hours .. couldn’t get a manager on the phone either . Finally the last night the manager of maintenance switched my room to pull out the toilet.. so I was there 3 days had a working toilet one night… it’s an old outdated hotel my room smelled like smoke .. the biggest issue is it’s unbelievable you cannot get an actual person that works there on the phone at all.prob worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at ",1
39557,"After excellent experiences at the Pullman Da Nang and Shanghai, we had high expectations for Panwa. Sadly our room felt shabby and in need of refurbishment. Staff were friendly but English levels were fair - having to repeat ourselves every time. I’d like to single out Keawl for special praise for looking after us so we’ll, especially playful to my son.   Other issues: We couldn’t order warm milk for our toddler through the in house app and had to go to the reception to explain. The AC was stuck on with warm or chilly with little adjustment. The bathroom lighting was far too dim. The grilled seafood buffet was undercooked and we became sick. The kids package which was $2000HK extra add on was very disappointing.  At this 5star level and prices, I Would think hard about staying again, especially with a wide range of other luxury resorts as the competition.  Paul H",1
42561,"I booked this room through Hopper for me and bestfriend for her birthday. The location was perfect and the price was better, but when I tell you the disbelief I was in when i walked through the gate!!! The receptionist was ok until I explained that the word 'boutique hotel' should not be presented on any platform whatsoever. She claimed that it was not false advertisement , told me that there is no cancellation policy and that monies paid would be forfeited regardless. They do not have a cancellation policy because this is HOSTEL. There are separate rooms but shared space. If you walk out of your room you are sure to see others lounging in close proximity. The receptionist did not leave the key to the gate to get out so me and my friend had to 'find' it behind the front desk (in which no one is at after 5 nor are they reachable by phone). The word 'boutique' described nothing about this place. The rooms do not look as appeasing in person especially the one with the outside lounge area (which sits in the back parking lot). The staff were not ready with linen for two days of my stay, luckily I brought my own towel, soap, and washcloth. There is NO parking. They have a small driveway in the back that can fit three cars max (in which we were not offered to park). coming back afterhours is a real struggle as you are sure to circle for no less than 20 min to find a space. The literal only thing I could say was decent was Charlie the chef and only person with manners. He fixes breakfast (homemade not restaurant style) from a very limited menu, but his manners make up for such a bad place to stay. This space may be ok for someone staying alone with no real hospitality needs but not for a trip to celebrate or enjoy the experience and ambiance of being 'treated'.",1
8090,"Let's start with the good. They kindly upgraded our room as it was our wedding anniversary. The staff are very accommodating and will do anything for you.  The hotel is very dated and that evidenced by the issues we had. It took 3 days to get our shower fixed. Our door keycard had to be replaced 3 times. Other guests mentioned the same issue. Lockers in the spa don't work, so you can't lock your belongings. Hammamsteam room appears to have been broken for some time. Doesn't look like it is going to be repaired. We have stayed at other Rixos hotels, and they were great, so expected the same here.  It is supposed to be ultra all inclusive, but there was only a local beer included. Heineken was the only other option and you had to pay for that. Unfortunately, this isn't to Rixos standards and doesn't justify the premium prices we've paid.",1
14697,"Jasmine - needs to work on how she deals with the guest.She needs to change her attitude and be more accommodating rather than being irritated when asked. Front desk officers needs to have that snile on their face so that the guests of the hotel would feel the sincerity in helping their guest. In addition, they need to be more efficient in attending to their guest so that there will no long line when checking in/checking out",1
65147,"As I put in my tittle I don’t understand how this place has so good reviews besides that the staff is pretty friendly. Customer service and the front staff was pretty friendly all the time and tried to help but the facilities for a three star are a joke. First we checked in later in the night because our flight got delayed, when we get to our room the lock was not working, we had to go down and have the front desk guy open the door with the key because the card reader was not working, the next morning I went to have breakfast and I still needed the staff to open the door of my room everytime I had to go in and out of the hotel. 2nd the hotel DOES NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONER, I specially look for hotels with air conditioner because I know in Europe a lot of places don’t have it. They promote trip advisor all over the hotel and trip advisor says they have air conditioner but they DO NOT HAVE. I spoke to the manager Hadrien who explained that they do not have air and they never had it, I asked for something to be done and he said he was going to talk to Claire [-------] about it and that she will determine if I could get a discount or refund and I am still waiting for her call. She was suppose to call me the day after because she was not working on that Monday. The front guy told us the previous night that at the time is not working that a technician is suppose to come to fix it (which was not true because they do nonot have have air conditioner) he brought a fan full of dust for us to use which was our salvation and sleeping spills every night. Third if there is no air conditioner you cannot open the windows because you can hear all the noise of the train, which I understood why they have earplugs in the room for use. 4th the bathroom was dirty, the tile walls had mold all over (see my pictures), I showed this to the manager who said he was going to talk to Claire which I am still waiting for the call. 5th we paid for the breakfast, first morning we went down around 9:30 (breakfast is 7-10am) there was barely anything left, I asked the lady for more croissant and she said they were no more left, asked for more yogurt and got the same answer. There was barely anything left. So I said well let’s go earlier the next day, we went around 8:30am and similar story. I have stayed all over the world and have never received a there is no more in any hotel you pay for breakfast. the breakfast room is very small, HOT and obviously feels crowded, we had to go to the outside to pay and eat because we barely got anything besides cereal. It is a continental very basic breakfast. Lastly carpets were disgusting dirty, chairs broken, pillows dirty,definitely this place needs improvement in terms of the facilities. I will NOT recommend it or ever go back to it. I booked it because of the reviews. Don’t be fooled by the good reviews.",1
31457,"Upon checkin the room did not have cups in bathroom, closet hangars or an ice bucket.  Hangars delivered and did not fit the closet rod.  Ice machine was out of service.  I made complaint with front desk manager and was told to contact her if anything else was wrong during stay.  I called and left message after we found the mini-frig did not work.  She has not returned the call as of the next day.    The restaurant and bar are not open, hair conditioner and body lotion are not provided (standard with a 4 star hotel).  The carpets in room and halls are stained.   Elevators are extremely slow and resulted in long back ups in lobby and frustrated guests.     I travel extensively for work and leisure and am shocked this is rated a 4 star hotel.",1
59026,"!! Be aware: the b&b lies in a party street- la traviesa,4 latas, Gatsby etc etc.. You can not sleep even with earplugs on!! Also you should know that this is an apartment. If you're neighbors are having fun, you will hear everything through the walls! I always prefer b&b because of more familiar. But I have never seen such a cold place as this one, in the morning you are hardly greeted, not once they would ask if everything was ok. I travel often and especially to Spain, have never found in my life before such a cold atmosphere. Breakfast is nothing special and only starts at 8. The air condition licked which is no problem if the rest would have been ok. Can not recommend the place.",1
30299,"It would be great to be able to leave a good review, but it is not possible. Due to COVID-19 we are unable to travel internationally. We had booked this hotel as part of a great trip planned last summer. Like the Z hotel, most places had non refundable rooms upon booking.  But, unlike the Z hotel, every other hotel regards customer service more seriously, and when COVID-19 shut everything down they all refunded the money spent on rooms that would never be used.   After a number of emails this hotel still refuses to take action on a customers concern with this extremely rare circumstances of a global pandemic.   They are in fact stealing the money we gave in trust of good service. We will never book with the chain and urge all to take great caution when dealing with Z hotels.",1

TVs have only Thai channels and no smart Tv .. when we checked in the tv was nit working 3. The make up room buttons don't work .. don't disturb buttons don't work 4.

We came back at 10 pm and asked for warming some food for the baby .. they came after 30 minutes with a baby cot ... 7. All usb switched don't work the place needs a serious upgrade .. 8. Don't know who designs the furniture .. if You sit in the sofa you slide off .. completely useless 9. We asked again the next day to warm baby food they came after 40 minutes  I thought Pullman would be good and being an Accor member ... nope it's crap  Never returning and people most speaking English is unacceptable,1
13599,"A perfect location in South Beach, with quick access to beaches, shops and restaurants. Basic king rooms are small and most don’t offer a view.

Street noise can also be an issue at times.",1
27230,"I am a frequent guest at Shangri-La hotels worldwide, and over time I learned that hotel brands are often tied more to quality of its guests, rather than staff.   My standard room is spacious, clean, with a commanding view of Lake Xuan Wu. I highly recommend hotel staff for their excellent service. Requests are met promptly. Concierge is resourceful and informative. They give great advice on local restaurants and transportation. At hotel's own Chinese Restaurant - Jiang Nan Zao - staff are also courteous and extremely diligent.   Yet all these great qualities can be ruined with unscrupulous guests. Morning scene in breakfast parlour is often chaotic with leftover food scattered on the floor, underneath dining tables. Chair cushion with large patches of soup stain are regular sights. How could anyone enjoy pleasant dining experience with such surrounding?  I urge hotel management to please introduce some discipline among its guests.   Nanjing is an ancient city with over 2500 years of history and civilisation. Isn't it time for its residents and business to also defend its reputation against ""barbaric"" visitors?",1
1939,"I was one of a group of 7 guys travelling to celebrate a 50th birthday. Between us we had 5 rooms. 1 person arrived separately the night before but 6 of us arrived together and needed to chek-in to 4 rooms. Firstly we arrived early morning due to an overnight flight. We could not get access to the rooms until 3pm at the earliest so then expect to pay the extortionate prices charged for acess to the restaurants and bars until you can use your food/beverage package - we were half-board. Check-in itself was a nightmare. The reception area at this huge venue is tiny so expect to wait in a queue. When it was our turn, they could not find our booking and sugegsted that we were at the wrong hotel!. After an 8-hour flight this is the last thing you want to hear. The rooms were large and reasonably well appointed. We used all of the restaurants and the Penthouse Club. Beware as they are all hugley overpriced and that is an understatement! A double spirit and mixer will easily cost around 40 GBP and so the staff then suggest you buy a bottle. Again, hugley inflated price but much cheaper than buying rounds of drinks. From early afternoon through the evening and every night expect to see lots of loud supercars out the front and then an influx of ""guests"". It soon became apparent that since the hotel and its high prices attracts rich people that is also attracts high-priced prostitutes as well. It's difficult to get seats or loungers around the pool as hotel guests because they let in so many of these hookers who are simply there to earn money through theri trade. This seems to be allowed because the waiting staff and security all benefit from extra ""tips"".  Definitley not a hotel for any families. You can see why it's an adults-only venue but to find that the place is overun by hookers especially at the weekend was a surprise.  Service at the hotel was slow at best. The food and beverage was average and always over-priced. When I spoke to other British guests that live in Dubai and were attending to use the bar/club they all agreed this venue is well-known to be the place that all hookers use. My suggestion - avoid unless this is what you are looking for.",1
42664,"I am really very disappointed  with my last stay in Movenpick Sousse. I can't find a word that describes this terrible experience and I will simply list the problems that I had to go through:  - During the check in, I had to go through the queue 3 times. Since the room was not ready, the lady told me that she will bring me the room access card once available so I will not need to got through the queue again, and of course she did not. I went twice through the long queue for almost 30 min in order to get the room card  -I booked a King bed room and they gave me a twin bed room. The lady in the reception did not accept to change the room and she told the will change the mattress to a big single one over the two twin bed and of course she did not  -The towels are dirty and stinky   -The sink is clogged   - The TV is not working   - We kept the do not disturb sign in the room during our stay because my wife got sick but this was not respecting by the house keeping and the maintenance agent. They entered the room without our permission - Their excuse is that they received an order form their manager !!  -In the restaurant and during the diner, I asked the waiter for a cutlery (because you almost never find a prepared table in the restaurant) - The waiter pointed his finger to another table and told me to get it by myself !!!  I am still shocked by this impolite answer !!  I still cannot understand how this kind of unpleasant events can happen in this hotel and all together during one stay.  If my wife wasn't sick, I would have left the hotel since day one. In short, this is a half start hotel   ",1
53697,"The hotel was in a convenient location near central and the Capitol Theatre (we were going to see Moulin Rouge).  We booked the room package included parking however the complex was full (at 2pm on a weekend) so we had to do multiple laps until we found someone leaving. I called the hotel when we were in the full carpark and their solution was to reduce our room cost by $15 despite overnight parking being more than that.  Check in was smooth. The room we were given was an accessible one despite not having a wheelchair. The bathroom was very basic, clean but not 4 star condition. Same with the room. Bed was not a Queen, definitely only a double.   We could hear people out on the street at 2am and the lift was very slow and it was quicker to take the stairs.  In summary, the hotel was okay, nothing to rave about but comfortable enough if you plan to only sleep there.  ",1
433,"Recently we spent 3 nights at the Echo. Even though our stay was pleasant, I was not too thrilled about it. Rooms are fairly small but clean and modern, and not too noisy. That is apart from the keys, that generate annoying beeps if you don't plug them in fast enough. Basically, everything is in order but in my view there are no upside surprises.  There is virtually no room to park and unload your verhicle. Once you managed that, you are to bring your suitcases to your room yourself as there is no concierge (which you would expect at a 4 star hotel). The hotel offers valet parking, but I would not recommend. You do not receive a copy of the intake form, and I have never seen any release form. My mirrors didn't function properly anymore, probably because they were folded with too much force.  Breakfast wasn't brilliant either. My main doubt is that you need to order a lot with staff (not just eggs, but also bread and other basics), and can not use the buffet fully yourself.  Location well....of course in any large town the station area will not be too brilliant, and the Milano station is for sure not that bad either, but still the main station square is not always inviting. Albeit the subway has two stops here, it is a bit further from the center.   So no postives? Yes, there are positives. Staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is nicely decorated on the ground floor, and price - quality is balanced. And of course the hotel is very ecologically aware.  But for me the experience wasn't positive enough to return at a future stay in Milano.",1

I contacted them nicely and explained that my stuff was left at the hotel today and I can track it , you should verify with your cleaning. He stated that their cleaner is honest and reliable , and that they haven't been able to find anything ""can't help sorry."" ""Why do you forget your stuff?"" he added. One of the cleaner took it and I provide the address ,  I reported it to the police, who had the tracker as well. The next morning, the hotel manager rang and said we have found it on the back of the hotel which is a lie , anyway he post it to me in MASK cartoon not even bothered to package it probably how cheap is that. Never trust them and come back",1
14127,"OK Hotel for Phuket. Certainly not a “5 star” as the Amari site describes, more like a lower end “4 star”.   The good: Great customer service - Very prompt attention everywhere I went. Staff were more then eager to please. Location - Very close / walking distance to Patong downtown and tourist areas. Place on the hill makes for some stunning views of the beach and surrounding bay.   The bad: Housekeeping - Room was not cleaned well. Mirrors and glass had blatant smudges and dirt. Housekeeping came to clean at irregular times late in the day. Additionally there is no turn down service, which is standard for a luxury property. Facility - while certainly beautiful, I found the huge spread out facility to be confusing the navigate. The staff were out of English maps during check-in which further complicated things. It also was a little annoying to need to golf-cart too and from the room.   Not a bad hotel by any means, but unless you are going to be spending a lot of time in Putong proper and need the location - would highly recommend staying at a comparably priced true 5 star resort outside of town, such as the nearby Marriott.",1
49375,"We had a very bad experience on this hotel. We were received with very rude manners by the reception, we could not understand. After long time waiting for our room, they brought us to our room through the bar which was full of smoke. We have to go through the bar to go in and out with our baby each time. During the two days we were not able to get towels. But the worst is that the staff was laughing at us. They told us several times ""come in 10 minutes"", after asking a few times they told us ""no towels before tomorrow"". The restaurants are overcrowded. You have to queue long time if you want meat or fish, and quality is just average. Swimming pools are pretty good, however, since early in the morning all sunbeds are occupied by towels, even the kids swimming pools. It is astonishing that the hotel does not have any policy about it. Most of special activities are overcrowded as well. For instance, they are supposed to offer some coctails in the evening during 2 hours but you have to queue to get one, and if you arrive during the second hour, there is no more, even inside the time limit.  The hotels is in general overcrowded and if you are looking for a relaxing holidays that's not your place. ",1

Following check-in I was sent to a female concierge who tried to sell me a lot of things I did not want, including restaurants, museums and a free breakfast to endure a sales pitch. Seriously, this was the lamest and most unprofessional service and behavior I have ever seen in a hotel. Two days later, another female concierge calls me twice on my room phone while I am sleeping to offer me another free breakfast and sales pitch. I have purchased a hotel room for a few nights and I would appreciate if I get what I have paid for and nothing else. The scamming part is so degrading for everybody, and it really takes away the pleasure of staying at a decent property in a wonderful city.

13605,"We arrived at our hotel at 11am to stay for one night before our cruise and four nights after ...It was very central to most things and the pictures and reviews where very good ..We where told our room would not be ready till 4pm but they would take our bags. The weather wasn't very good so decided to go for a little walk and have some lunch .When we arrived back at 2.50 we asked what time the room would be ready.The girl said oh it wont be long if you grab a seat I will let you know ...maybe 25 .30 mins...At 3.56 we decided to ask again ..The girl had now gone homeand we spoke to David we mentioned what had happened and he said ""Oh well it's still 3 mins to four so we are still early""   He gave me a piece of paper and told us what block we where in. He never gave us any details about the hotel what we could or couldn't do. We later found out from housekeeping the next day that the hotel has a private part of the beach that you are entitled to sunbeds and towels ...Maybe you need to guess ...Met Felix (the manager )and another guy on the way out of our building who informed us the elevator is broken. Lucky enough they helped us with our bags up the two flights..I was asked was everything ok and explained I wasnt very happy with the lack of customer service. Felix apologised and said he would speak to his staff.He also said if I needed to cancel my other days he would honour this without a deposit being taken.Thankyou Felix .Next day we needed to check out at 11am Got to the elevator and it was still broken No contact from anyone to give us help down the stairs.Now the housekeeping guy who gave us the information about the beach helps us with all our bags ...We felt obliged to tip...I was not bothered about the money but surely a building with three storeys should have their lift repaired within 20 hours .Or arrange for help for customers .When I arrived at reception I spoke to Felix again and told him the lift was still broken He said Oh yes ...Oh well follow by example .I now ask him to cancel my remaining four days  Thankyou Felix ..Now I am informed I have to pay $28 for site fees .Didmt really have time to use anything but hey ho ...Now I get my Barclaycard bill a week later and a payment of £61.50 has been taken from Washington Park Hotel  .I think the hotel need to send staff for some customer service training It would be nice to have some information or an information pack on arrival .The rooms are very small the bathroom has the smallest space for any toilet I have ever seen ...The pool is very small and the sun beds need to be renewed so dirty The blocks look awful and could do with a refurb .As for faulty elevators they should have been a priority for customer.One redeeming feature was the bed linen and towels all white clean and fluffy ..I would never ever stay here again and would definitely not recommend to my worse enemy..I had to book another hotel upon our arrival from our Cruise and still awaiting my refund",1
33442,"I'll preface this review by saying my husband and I stayed here in 2019 and loved this hotel.  My son and I feel quite differently, after this most recent stay.  There was absolutely nothing impressive about our room.  The room was pretty tight and the refrigerator only had enough space to accommodate mini-bar contents (alcohol).    We requested a quiet room and it was quiet the first night (a Friday night).  The second night, my son couldn't sleep with noise from the outside including cars revving their engines while traveling through the Domain and what we believe was music coming from the hotel's patio.  What we did like about the hotel was the valet staff and transport provided by the house car.  I've spent less money at hotels I've enjoyed more and will likely take my business elsewhere the next time I'm in Austin.  ",1

They would take cash and other charges at that point of time itself, as if you would run away post the activities. The guest team is also not interested. Despite e-scooters were running across the resort, there would hardly be any available whenever you requested for the time. Also, the restaurant team and other staff is also rude.

33380,"Cancun is beautiful and it was wonderful to be in the sun, but this resort missed the mark all over the place. The best part was the wonderful people working there. Everyone was amazingly kind.  Here is where it fell short: ROOM: the room was always damp and smelled as such. I pumped the AC at 19*C all week, had an air purifier running continuously, and it never improved. The sheets felt damp, my clothes were damp. It was gross.  FOOD: What's that old joke, ""it wasn't very good and there wasn't enough of it""? The buffet meals were fine; there was lots of choice and the food was good. The sit-down restaurants were also good, but the portions were oddly small. I was disappointed that things weren't open all the time. For example, the coffee station (with 1 machine) was only open in the morning. The bars didn't open to until late morning (11am or noon), Pizza was at noon, sandwiches/nachos were at noon, ice cream was 3-4pm, tacos weren't until 6pm...and only on certain nights!  HOUSEKEEPING: Great job on general clean-up, but wasn't planning on changing the sheets all week until I stripped the beds.  ACTIVITIES: They had daily activities, but we're missing out on key things like an arcade for the kids or a movie room. If you weren't into the planned session, like Zumba, there wasn't another choice. Also, poolside activities ended at 5:30pm and all activities ended at 9pm.  PAYMENT: They wouldn't charge anything to the room. I expected when I dropped off laundry or ordered an expensive steak, I could charge the room, but instead I needed to pay immediately.  Done things are cash only (Mexican Pesos or USD), such as when I wanted to buy the pictures from my parasailing trip. I had to come up with $55 on the spot.  Overall, I had a nice week, but I wouldn't come back to this resort. I would look for one with more available snack/drink options and activities throughout the day.",1
5053,"Stayed here 4 times, first 2 was amazing. 3rd time was earlier this year during winter, room requested was not ready as the previous guests smoked in the room. The maintenance team took care of it Promptly and professionally in a couple of hours. Kudos to the maintenance team/house keeping team. Hotel did not charge the previous guests for flouting the rules, according to the staff.  The 4th time was bad!!! Which was 10th August 2019, Our check in experience was one of the worst for a top rated hotel! Booked the room for 3 including an additional bed/bunk bed, checked in at 4pm, room was not ready pending final inspection from housekeeping team. Then the main issue arises, no additional bed for the 3rd guest, and asked us to be on a additional bunk bed waiting List as they did not register our request which was sent weeks ago via Email directly to the team with an official reply stating it would be done. Check in team told us to have the 3rd person sleep on the sofa and they would provide blankets and pillow. reason: they ran out of additional beds. Is this what we should be expecting from a top rated hotel in Korea? To have your guess sleep on the sofa? Took us 20- 30 mins to get them to recognize the issue and own the mistake to fix it. By the way, for the record, we booked the room for 3 pax right from the start. If there is an issue with Agoda (I am not sure) please fix the communication with them. It’s just an IT issue.  After 10-15 mins speaking with the staff, the Manager/ or senior member of the team came out and shared that there is no more bunk we will have to be put on the waiting list and if we get the bed, it would be FOC! Wow! That’s great! BUT i booked the room for 3! I don’t want to be on a waiting list for the 3rd bed! Where is our 3rd guest going to sleep? Btw, they suggested Sofa with blankets and pillows. This is not couch surfing, this is Shilla hotel. We shared that this is not our first time staying here and we have been here about 3-4 times, why are we facing this issue now? Manager/ senior staff replied: “Based your Agoda record you have only stayed here twice with us. but that’s not the issue...” me in my mind: *Gosh* really?! *speechless* I guess they know better than we do.  Anyways, even if we haven’t stayed here previously, I guess that’s not the way to make your guests feel uncomfortable with the whole check in process...  ——> extremely disappointed 10th August 2019 check In experience at about 3.50pm-4.20 pm  Nonetheless, This is still a great place and has great amenities and great view, but what makes the hotel top rated is the service of the staff from the beginning to the end. I In conclusion, still a great hotel but good luck to you if it is during the peak season, they might not be able to handle your requests well. - 3.34am from Shilla Hotel ",1

But the double rooms are quite descent and the bathrooms are newly refurbished.  Nothing fancy, but a decent night stay. The hotel next door (Phoenix) manages the check in and also to open the locked door on the outside, which can be confusing at first.",1
31464,"Like many hotels this one has scaled back services due to Covid - only a little too far! The hotel hallway was not vacuumed the whole 5 nights I was there (a glass sat there the whole time) along with various pieces of rubbish. It makes you wonder whether any touch points were being cleaned at all. Some elevators had hand sanitizer some did not - there was no consistency. In room bars were removed (fair enough) but no glasses left so that you could drink water or buy your own to consume later. No cleaning of the room at all during my stay but they would drop off supplies as requested. No bar, restaurant or concierge.  Trying to get information for a first time visitor to Chicago was not easy. You get better answers from google rather than ask the front desk. Assistance with cabs etc was non existent. Rooms were ok but could have been setup better for a more effective use of space - it felt like furniture was thrown in the room without a lot of thought or planning  - similar in the bathroom - no where to hang hand towels near the sink for example. Location was good and handy to Restaurants and shops",1
24423,Stayed at the property for a night while travelling for business.  Location is one of their biggest drawbacks given the traffic in Milan. They don't have a hot kitchen which means they don't have a room service either. Rooms and specifically the bathroom were super fancy. Shower area is as big as the bedroom and the view of the garden. Seems too much money has been spent in making the rooms super luxurious and kitchen/food have been completely ignored. This one is ain't for me.,1

The room had Mould on the window, air conditioning smelt horrible, stains on the apparently new bed sheets, toilet seat falling off. We found the staff very rude and not helpful in any way,  we tried to checked out straight away but had no help whatsoever from the staff so we left for a better hotel that we have stayed in many times now, I would avoid this hotel at all costs, the rooms advertised look nothing like the basic rooms they give you, speaking to other unlucky guests they all experience the same poor disgusting accommodation and while we were waiting for a taxi to take us away from this nightmare of a hotel we found more couples doing the same as us. We will never be staying in this hotel if it was the last one available. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO BE REFUNDED.",1

Both were exceptionally gracious and polite in handling the check in / check out formalities. Very efficiently handled,  The property was well maintained, all Covid protocols in place.  Housekeeping staff were polite. Break fast had good options and yes, as expected, the staff were well trained.

The rooms are perfect, modern and spacious, the bathroom amazing, very modern. The breakfast was good. Just the receptionist an asian descent boy, he was arrogant and not friendly, all the time using his mobile and talking by phone, you as client have to wait for him. I recommend this hotel if you are traveling by car, if not try to find something close to the city.",1

16650,"If you book this hotel, accept that it does not feel like a resort .  Unfortunately my first impression at check in was not good.  We struggled to find the hotel at night, passing it by at least five times because the address is 1777 Ala Moana, but the entrance to the hotel is on Hobron St.  There is NO sign at the entrance where you drive in.  When I mentioned this to the person that was checking me in, she said “Well, there’s a sign at the top of the building.”   When I replied “That isn’t very helpful when you are looking for hotel signage at the entrance.”  No apology or “Thanks, I will mention that to management .”   The front desk , concierge and valet staff are completely indifferent.  If you need anything plan on doing it yourself.  When I asked where the closest urgent care was, no one could give me an answer so I just Googled it.  It was literally across the street.  This hotel doesn’t feel like an HGV property where you are normally treated very well.  I have told friends how great HGV properties are, shared how special the staff makes you feel, but you won’t get that experience at The Modern Honolulu.  The room and location are great, the pool is small, not very many lounge chairs, cushions really need to be bleached or replaced.    There are so many choices of places to stay in Honolulu that I would not return here.",1
64941,"We had a walk to the Limak Lara  from our hotel on Lara  beach to ask if we could go for a tour of the hotel as had been thinking of booking for Sept. We were spoken to on the phone at security and told to go back at 10 am the following day for a tour. The next morning we walked back at 10 am with our passports and handed them in to the security guard who was very pleasant and made our way to Guest Relations. Now the guest relations lady didn’t hide the fact that we were a nuisance but found someone to show us round or so we thought. He was very pleasant as we stood in reception and told us about the hotel. 1400 rooms but only 800 or so occupied at the moment.  We walked 10 yards one way. 10 yards back as he talked and then he said he wasn’t allowed to show us a room. On asking if he would show us outside. No, he wasn’t allowed. So that was it. A total waste of all our time. Spent 5 minutes listening to him in reception isn’t selling your hotel to us. We previously visited Delphin be grand a couple of years ago and the tour consisted of everywhere. A lovely room, the bars , the pools etc and finished off with a drink in the lovely reception. Subsequently we booked a fortnights holiday there. The same with the Royal Holiday Palace. A friendly guest relations lady showed us everywhere and was so accommodating. If this is how guests are treated when they are interested in staying at your hotel then I’m afraid it isn’t very impressive. We left feeling that we were an inconvenience and it was a total waste of our time. Why accept our request for a tour when you have no intention of giving one. I suggest a trip to the Delphin hotels to see how it’s done properly x",1
46077,"nothing to do with the hotel as such but the location is fairly isolated from everything you would want to see or do in Rome. The room I had 322 was nice enough, very clean and slightly resembled the pictures. First time ever in my near 60 years that the room curtains were closed and on opening the curtains found out the windows were blacked out, full view was air conditioning units, windows not clean and below what looked like a builders yard,  There is a mini bar with no price list. there are no tea or coffee facilities nor an iron in the room. The roof top restaurant is lovely but unfortunately does not not have a bar or restaurant to enjoy its location at any time other than breakfast, Breakfast was  only served till 10.00 am which in general is fine but after a long night maybe 11.00 at weekends would be good. No room service that I know of. The breakfast as such is self serve which is normal now and was very good. Now my real bug bearer.. IT IS NOT A SPA HOTEL. It is a hotel with a spa. the gym and spa are not included but you can use them for........100 euros each PER DAY. Yes each per day.

30721,"The W taipei is located in a great place near 101. However, I was surprised by how many SWs lingering in the lobby, texting their clients on Line, and staring at their phones. There are lots of young women walking around in the lobby carrying 2 phones, and LV bags, and wearing Chanel. They appear just a little over legal age. On check-in, I was surprised to see prominent signs at the check-in counter that no drugs and no vaping is allowed in the hotel, and also no money laundering. I learned from a friend that this hotel has a reputation as a brothel for clients, and that the SWs linger around at the restaurant and bar at night waiting for the call to go upstairs. Recently, while getting into the elevator, I saw a foreign SWer check in to a suite at 9:30 pm, all decked out in LV and Prada carrying the free COVID tests they give you upon entry into Taiwan. The suites are booked by sex workers on business trips who are often long term guests. It appears the SWs are back and working it again. I would not recommend this hotel to families with young children.",1
25671,When I arrived I pulled up to the front to unload my bags. I went in to grab a cart and some guy told me I couldnt park there and to pull in the back to unload my bags. I was not going to do that since I was already right there. It was very insulting.  In addition; Parking sucks.  I didn’t know that parking was going to be 3 blocks away and I was supposed to scan the barcode at the hotel desk before I went to park. ,1
56591,"This property has the potential to be rated 5 stars as it’s location and guest rooms are very good but it goes down hill on a number of fronts and the biggest issue is the perceived lack of staff numbers and poor training  We arrived in Dubai early in the morning and made it to Barjeel relatively easily (make sure you know exactly where the place is as our taxi driver had no idea as it’s a very small property) at around 9am and unfortunately we were greeted but a completely empty reception and after looking around the property still couldn’t find anyone around. Lucky for us, a security guard of a neighboring site was kind enough to offer help and after about half hour we rang and rang until a butler picked up as he was asleep (at 9am???). He notified the receptionist who finally arrived (really needs training as we felt talking to her was like pulling teeth as she offered no information and we had to keep asking questions) and we weren’t the only ones looking for a check in as another couple arrived soon after (so they can corroborate our story). The receptionist said we can’t check in till eleven (fair enough in a way) but offered little in the way of guidance of what we should do. It was 40c outside and when I asked if she had any brochures on things to do or see there wasn’t much response and after again asking for at least a map of the area (this is our first time to Dubai) found a small map which was pretty useless. I find it extraordinary that a hotel/guesthouse or any serious accommodation wouldn’t provide their guests with some basic tourist guides and info in a foreign place. Anyway we were on our own so we ourselves and the new couple banded together and went out to kill 1.5 hours so we could check in and let me tell you after flying for half a day the last thing one wanted to do is go out in 40c heat in a foreign place with no helpful info from reception on where to go or what to do or even accommodate us temporarily in its restaurant for that time.  When we did check in after we suffered in the heat for 1.5 hours (she could of told us there was a shopping centre 500m away) there rooms were good and fairly comfy except there is no cold water (we think the pipes get so hot that the cold water gets warmed) so don’t expect a soothing cold shower post a day out. Another small thing was I talked to the receptionist about our tv not working and she said she will get someone to have a look at it the next day but of course no one arrived (only a small issue as we didn’t come to watch tv but it’s the principle here). The breakfast was well below a normal standard which is very surprising considering there is a big Carrefour around the corner and one could easily supply everything one needs just from there for a breakfast.   Overall not a very good experience and we think the guesthouse is being neglected by its parent Heritage hotel and when we asked for an airport transfer it was very hard going and told in no uncertain terms that a driver can swing by Barjeel (from Heritage) at 6.30am after picking up guests from parent hotel and sounded like we were an inconvenience. When asked about taxis all we got was yes they are around (no we will arrange one for you at the time you desire). To be perfectly honest the nice security guide was more of a help as he showed us how to use the metro and was going to take us to the taxi (and he doesn’t even work there).   I’m giving it an extra star as the location is excellent right on the water and witching a short stroll to souks and abras to take you across the river.   They desperately need to lift their game ",1

52604,"I arrived on a very late flight one evening, after what had already been an extremely long day.  So a shower and bed were very welcomed.  But there are a number of pros and cons with this hotel, so I'll begin with the pros:  1. The hotel is very close to the airport (within 5 mins) 2. While there is currently no hotel shuttle to the airport due to Covid, this hotel does offer reimbursement of taxi/Uber/Lyft fees that you would incur, and which I did get reimbursed for.  I will add that the other hotels I contacted do not offer this. 3. They do offer complimentary bottles of water and bagged ""To Go"" breakfasts if you so choose.   4. There were kitchenettes in my rooms  Now for the cons:  1. When I reached my hotel room, it looked to have been renovated at some point.  However, the renovation was done rather poorly, and the room definitely showed some age and wear.  2. The air conditioning would not go below about 76 degrees, and would simply cycle off despite having the fan setting staying on. 3. There was very little hot water in the shower.   4. While the remote control was sanitized and covered in a plastic bag, there were no batteries in the remote and the battery cover was missing.  As luck would have it, the tv didn't have any external buttons, so there was no watching it. 5. There was trash left in the room. 6. After my stay, I found a $15 supplemental charge on my card in which I contacted the hotel about.  The clerk said that it was merely a validation charge and would be reimbursed, but not for 10 days for some reason.  It did eventually get credited back, but it's a headache.    After showering and realizing the a/c in my room wasn't working properly, I called the front desk to let them know.  In Texas, you don't want a room with a broken a/c unit.  The clerk immediately checked for other available rooms and inside of 5 minutes, she had me in another room.  There is that bit of hassle having to pack all of your stuff back up to move (compounded by being very tired), but it was well worth the change.  In the new room, the a/c worked flawlessly and the bed offered a very comfortable and welcomed night sleep.  Overall, the staff was very friendly and once I was in the new room, I had a very restful night.  But there is room for improvement here.  But I would stay here again.",1

If you have suitcases, it will be a struggle to climb up the stairs to the Reception; followed by more steep stairs to the dormitory room.  The room is small and is not well ventilated. We decided to change and paid more for a private room in the annex just down the road rather than the main hostel. Breakfast was nothing to rave about. The washing-up of the utensils seem unhygienic and the Italian 'chef' was unhappy with me when I wasn't aware that we had to first rinse the used utensil in the first basin, then dipped it in another basin to wash it and finally onto a third clean water basin. After these dipping, the utensil still seem oily and not thoroughly washed.  Glad that I only had breakfast once during my 5 day stay there.",1

We liked the room. We didn’t like the awkward upgrade process by which we were basically trapped and tricked into getting it.   The kid zone was pretty depressing. I don't think it's a great option for families. Two swimming pools, one nice view--and that's it. Fortunately, there is a scooter rental place across the street; otherwise, you're trapped.",1

Housekeeping could be definitely improved as our room was not as clean as it should be for a five star accommodation. The bathroom sink was cracked and the purple panels separating the bathroom were dirty and greasy. The suite had a superb bath. However, I could not use it properly due to leaking bath plug. The bath would simply not fill up. The Dinner Buffet at Bonjour restaurant offers a variety of foods but meat options are scarce. Moreover, some of the guest were allowed to dine in their hotel slippers which does not display a good tone or etiquette for a five star establishment. I also have to add that it is mandatory to wear a swimming cap in the swimming pool. This was very surprising as this was the only hotel with such rule out of 5 five star hotels we were staying in China. The experience was ok but not of a excellent value.",1

61641,"We came here for our honeymoon and we asked about a honeymoon package. We were told that they didn’t have a package but, they would do some flowers in the room for us as a gift. We agreed and were thrilled to at least get some flowers in the room. We also reached out to them for a shuttle from the airport to the hotel. They told us the driver would be waiting for us at the 2nd exit. When we got outside we saw the sign as posted but the driver wasn’t there, they had to be called and we waited 30 minutes for them to arrive to pick us up.  When we arrived at the hotel we had to lug our luggage up stairs are there isn’t a easy access way to get luggage into hotel to reception desk. We arrived in the evening so, the hotel was quiet. But, the 2 members behind the desk took awhile to check us in. The voyage to our room was tough because there’s no elevators as the rooms are set up like a campground. So we had to drag our luggage through gravel and uneven sidewalk.  When we finally got to our room we had to admit it was nicer than expected minus the promise setup in the room. We have no complaints about the room, it’s minimal as expected and has a working fridge which is a plus in the heat.   I got sick am with an upset stomach the second night here and my husband went to the front desk to ask if he could buy a sprite, ginger ale, or tea. He was told the kitchen was closed and he needed to go into town to get the desired beverage even after he explained to them my condition. I never thought purchasing a soda from a hotel would be an issue especially when they have room service and it didn’t require preparation for him to purchase the soda instead of walking 15-20 minutes to a store leaving me on my own in the room.  We also asked for a cup of ice to put in our water bottles and were told that they sell ice for 60 baht a bucket. I asked if I could simply purchase 2 cups as a bucket of ice is too much and we don’t have a way to keep it frozen since the fridge turns off when we leave. We were told that it’s only sold by the bucket and if we want ice we have to buy a bucket of it.   If it wasn’t for the fact that this location is good, we are on our honeymoon, and we can’t get a refund I would’ve gladly changed hotel. The customer service here has been the worst I’ve ever experienced and we travel quite often.   The breakfast is decent but, the heating on some of the food doesn’t seem to work so, the food is kinda lukewarm other items are uncovered and there are flies on the food. My husband enjoyed the rice and had that every day for breakfast. The juices are a mystery each day, they say one thing and taste like something else.   A few positives the beach is a 10 minute stroll away, the housecleaning lady was so sweet and kind, she told of us of a few places to visit and is one of the tea I’m not completely disappointed with our stay here.  Would I come back to this hotel, no I would not. There are other hotels in this area that are closer to the beaches and though they might cost a bit more, I think it would be worth it to have better customer service and quality of stay especially as it’s our honeymoon.",1

First, our TV remote felt like a game of “Bop It.” Hit it, press it, smash it, Bop it! No matter what it barely even worked! Second, the shower hot water only lasted 2 minutes. It might be best to shower together. If you have more than 2 people, you might have to get creative! Anyone over 6ft tall better watch their head, I smacked my head on the top of the shower door frame! The hallways smell like a workout gym. I’m not sure if it’s all of the chlorine, or my uppper lip, but I’m pretty sure it’s all of the chlorine. If you’re an OCD sleeper, you’ll thank me for this.. The smoke detectors hovered above our bed (The little green light was blinking all night). And I’m sure there’s a good reason for it, but the elevators require a key card just to press the interior buttons. Would’ve been nice to have been told this before we rode up & down until we finally figured it out. Kind of annoying if you’re holding all your bags, but now you gotta pull out your key card just to press the button. To each their own, but these things slightly annoyed me.

42991,"I can't believe why this hotel has so many 5-star rating... Overall, this is literally the worst Marriott hotel I have ever stayed. Even the category one hotels I've stayed are way better than this one.   1) The hardware is very bad.  hotel is located in a busy district. But the soundproof of the window is basically 0. And I've tried rooms facing every side of the hotel, none of them meet minimal expectation for quietness.   2) The software (service/staff) is even worse.  When I checked in, I told the receptionist several times I would like to have a quite room. He told me that room was not ready and needed to wait for around 2 hrs. I said it was totally OK as long as the room was quite. But after I got back to hotel after 6 hours, I found the room given to me had a very noisy equipment right outside my window. I actually switched several rooms, the room given to me at first was the most terrible one. Either the receptionist was not familiar with the room at all or he just never cared what I really wanted. I asked to switch room. The switching process was just ironic. Even though I told them explicitly I would like a quite room(many many times) and away from elevator. The room they tried to switch me in was just behind elevator. And they tried to show me the room one by one, that means after they showed me one room, I had to call them to ask for the next and wait another 10 minutes... This is just very very annoying!  After I saw several rooms, I gave up. I told them I would like to move to another hotel. A manager accompanied me downstairs to the lobby, but he didn't offer any help other than seeing me off. They even didn't offer to help call a taxi or carry luggage for me or even for my wife. This was unbelievable! There were other minor things, for example even I checked in 6hrs before I got my key card,  there was no welcome fruit in my room; the checkin process was too long etc...",1

Rooms completely unfit for clients, loud disco music until 0300hrs most nights, ended at 1200hrs on the rest of the nights. Repetitive food day in day out, not a good experience. I never .the room I had paid for  even after 4 changes. I never would because the small man on reception made sure of that. A terrible holiday  for which I take the blame.  having read previous reviews which I did not believe. I only hope that Love Holidays do not send future customers there unless they tell them the conditions to expect.",1
20019,In the morning before I wanted to leave for Paris I didn’t feel well and decided to get a Covid-test. Then I wrote to the hotel asking not to charge the room. Officially I could have cancelled a day before. But it was already too late. In the evening I received the result of the test; unfortunately „positive „. The hotel decided nevertheless to charge the room. Today I received a mail asking how was may stay and hopefully I enjoyed it. This is cynical. Therefore I cannot recommend this hotel.,1
47165,"Location is ok, you’ll need a car to go anywhere in Amman any way. Friendly staff, efficient check in and check out. Hotel allows people to smoke indoors so it’s horrible, even though not legal. Breakfast is ok, waiters hover around the tables, watching you eat - uncomfortable. Hotel food and drinks very expensive, but at least the sandwiches were very large. Quiet overall. Large room in need of contemporary decor. Actually hotel needs a complete renovation; looks like the 80s. Comfortable bed and pillows. Small tv with very few channels in English. Bath ok size. User shower head instead of hand-held head bc the latter will splash water all over the bathroom floor. Nice towels and ok toiletries. Good quiet AC. Safe, mini fridge, robes, instant coffee, tea and slippers available in the room. Good size conference rooms.",1
22496,"The king room I was assigned was very nice . It was clean and smelled good and the A/C definitely was working well. The linen and bed covers were nice and I checked the condition of the mattress underneath and it was clean and new looking. A surprise was the laundry basket under the bathroom sink I put the wet towels in it. It seemed a good idea to me. other than the rolling desk chair which was torn on both arms and very shabby, I was pleased with the room. However, the next morning and breakfast area was a disaster in my opinion. I entered the dining area at 8:10  and there were no scrambled eggs, bacon was woefully under cooked, there was only 1 muffin left and pancake batter was spilled all over the counter. Obviously, the desk person or cleaning staff did not monitor the area.If you pay more for having breakfast included  then it really should be available. Even though I was not impressed, I will probably stay there again because my destination is only about 5 minutes from this hotel. I do not take all the construction and inconvenient driving side roads to reach the motel against them. some things can't be helped.",1
23098,"We (partner and I + 2.5 yr old) spent a total of four nights at the hotel. While the hotel was quite simple, it provided all the basic amenities and was nice for a short stay in the city. The staff were all extremely helpful, welcoming and accommodating.   Although we were originally concerned that it was a bit far from the main touristic center, it was ultimately to our advantage being away from all the hustle and bustle. The metro stop for the city center is around a 2-5 min walk from the hotel and it took around a 12 min metro ride. We did not include breakfast in our reservation and found many inexpensive bakeries and coffee shops right down the street for a quick breakfast.   I would add, however, that our room (comfort room) was very small for the three of us though we ultimately made do even with a baby cot for our 2.5 year old.   Important to note that during the week days, the street traffic was a bit noisy since our room faced the main road (even with the windows closed), and the internet was spotty in our room on the 2nd floor.

At first I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel upkeeps (given it’s been 8, 9 years since its opening), and you heard about all these parties that happened in the hotel. The rooms are generally in decent conditions. But during my latest stay, I gotta say I am quite disappointed with the stay. Things are definitely deteriorating, at least not as pleasant as my previous stay.   - one of reading lights above the bed was broken  - when I tried to call whatever/whenever service at the night when I checked in around 11pm. Took me 2 or 3 times to finally reach someone  - and today after I got back, this gotta be one of  most poorly made hotel bed I have ever seen . It was just sloppy. Pillow case is wrinkle, bed sheet was not tugged in.   . I used to enjoy coming back to the hotel, but gotta say experience of this trip has definitely been a little disappointing. I hope the hotel can see the message and work to improve the situation. ",1
34535,"I can reccomened staying here if you're going to a gig at Wembley or sightseeing in London. Not alot nearby but enough take aways and supermarkets if youre staying a short time. Easy transport link into the city as long as you don't need a stair free access station.  I don't reccomened this hotel for families with young children although staff treated us nicely, their policy on giving notice if you would like your room made up, caused me some stress when my 2 yr old daughter fell ill  overnight and the lack of compassion I felt from the staff when trying to get fresh sheets and towels the next day was a dampener on the service.  The saving grace was Shail in the restaurant the next night who went out of his way to accommodate the mad requests of a 2yr old during dinner and the meal itself was just like dinner I would make at home which was a welcome change to the usual take-away",1
22521,They charged my personal account before I got there after I specifically requested pay at hotel because I was waiting on my business debit card. I wouldn't be so upset now but the only employee that seemed to care about the gravity of the situation couldn't fix it.  Now by the time it is all said and done with I'll spend a week with that account drained over an incident that never should have happened in the first place. Kind of ruins a perfectly nice stay.,1

The room though very very small has a comfortable bed and extremely clean, with the cleaning lady coming in each morning to clean the place. Coffee is available right thru the day.

27252,"Third visit to this hotel and a number of serial disappointments in a single night stay make me wonder what F&B management is up to at this property.   - Lobby bar: waitress confirms Perrier as their sparkling water brand, same waitress brings Watsons soda (tap) water.  - Breakfast on second floor. Table 77 in case F&B management cares to check:  -Filthy chair upholstery on all 4 chairs. Filthy as in 2-star local hotel filthy. I couldn't believe.   -Fly (?) swimming in creamer jug (no kidding) , hadn't seen this for years in China, all hotel classes confounded, and I've seen the good the bad and the ugly in 11 years living here.   - Small (fast food restaurant small) paper napkins from a table dispenser..... At a Shangri-la?  - Sticky floor (probably mopped with less than clean water) all around the buffet area. Dark flooring imitating wood, in case Management wonders.   -Crossed restaurant manager on duty three times, not a single ""good morning"" from him.   -Quality of bacon and sausages in the buffet needs an urgent check (urgent as in 2-star local quality urgent).   A property that has a serious F&B management problem. Run on local standards, clearly at odds with the Brand (that I love) and the prices charged.  URGENT action needed to bring standards back.",1

Lifts to the floors are a joke take forever and always one outbid service can be waiting for 10-15mins just go up to or down from room  As for local amenity fee of 38 dollars per night is an absolute rip off and basic money grabbing by the hotel totally unnecessary and non-optional ,1
2351,"The T Hotel is a training hotel for hospitality students.  Coming from a hospitality background, this was the first thing that caught my eye.  I had read reviews and heard that it was a really nice hotel, and because I wanted to support students going into the hospitality field, I booked our stay here.  My review is critical, but hopefully it is taken as constructive and in the spirit of educating the students and improving the hotel.  Firstly, the location is quite remote...set in a residential area and not within walking distance to anything that visitors would want to get to.  The hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle to Central, but it's one-way and only during week days which was bad for me since we were there over a weekend!  My Uber ride from T Hotel to Central cost an average of HK$75 one way.  Nothing the hotel can change about this except maybe offer the shuttle throughout the week.  Regarding service, the staff-guest ratio was rather high as clearly there are trainers coaching the students in every area.  So the effort gets high marks, but the actual service delivered has room for improvement.  For example, when we checked in, our luggage was handled well, check-in process was smooth, and someone walked us to our rooms and gave a full tour of every item in the room and how to use it (a bit overkill) ...but we were never told along the way what our room # was or given the wifi password. The breakfast buffet was nice, but didn't offer any cook-to-order eggs (mostly Asian hot items) and also didn't even have a take-away cup for coffee.  The dining room staff could improve on their table service in terms of attentiveness (especially because of the high number of staff standing around watching you eat and that it's a buffet so there is less they have to do) or getting a coffee order.  A suggestion regarding guest room décor would be to make the shade for the exposed glass bathroom wall something that looks nicer since it spends most of the time covering the glass...ours had some stains on it and was just an off-white roll down shade.  Wouldn't bamboo or something else look nicer?  Best wishes to the T Hotel and it's students...the hospitality field is hard work,  long hours and very competitive, especially  in a place like HK.",1
34569,"Having stayed here for 5 nights in a family room, we found the below:  PROS: 1) Very good breakfast with a variety of choices. A fantastic tea/coffee/latte/cappuccino machine and a small choice of juices compliment a buffet of bread, pastries, basic fruit, cereals, yoghurt, eggs, beans, tomatoes and more.  2) Good location with the tube station very near. A number of supermarkets and fast food outlets are even closer.  3) Good condition of the room. Modern decor which has been well kept.  4) There are two lifts that work well. Never had to wait longer than 2 minutes for a lift to arrive. 5) We requested daily housekeeping which was taken care of to a high standard in a subtle manner. There was one day when housekeeping didn't arrive, but after a  simple call at Reception, there was an immediate response.  CONS: 1) Although I had paid to use the car park for the duration of the stay, I ended up parking outside the hotel premises on double yellow lines for 4 out of the 5 nights I stayed here. Parking is offered  on a first come first served basis and was usually full by around 5pm. As I spent most of my evenings out, there was no space for me. There seemed to be quite a few other guests with the same issue. Having said that, I did not receive a parking ticket - hoping I don't find a nasty surprise in the post!  2) Being slightly ultra critical, I feel the laminate style flooring made the floor in the room feel slightly dusty after a number of days' usage.  Overall, we are very satisfied with our stay, particularly considering the cheap rates we paid in comparison to other hotels across London.",1
39512,"If you want your peace disturbed DO NOT stay here. I read the reviews and booked thinking my stay would be nice and relaxing. It was the opposite. From checking in and changing rooms 3times. The first room they gave to me had dead mosquitos everywhere on the bed, floor, in the bathroom! I waited 45mins to speak to a manager which I was then told there all in a meeting.  Staff are really not helpful or friendly..  Changed rooms to the 3rd floor in the same building..the night was terrible having to listen to traffic, and trolleys being moved around, lots of unnecessary noise! Waited 45mins for a bath robe after having called reception 3 times to find out what happened to the bath robe.. Dinner selection is poor at the buffet and staff do not speak English. They don't really talk to you either other than a lovely guy called Denis who approached me at bfast and asked how my stay was. I told him how rubbish my first night and experience has been here. He helped me change rooms again to another building. The beds in the hotel are rock hard I had to ask for another mattress topper still didn't make a difference - woke up with a terrible back and neck pain!  This new building i moved to another nightmare your listening to screaming kids at 2am, traffic again, and then the couple below me start having a full on fight at 5.30AM - plates smashing and domestics on the balcony! I had to call reception then security came twice to sort them out. I finally spoke to a manager during check out! Expressed all my concerns to him.  This is not a 5*, terrible service from staff and noone seems to understand what is included in your package whether your full or half board.  Thanks Denis for trying to make my stay enjoyable! ",1

22546,My stay at your hotel was very disappointing. Although the room was nice and I was comfortable my interaction with the staff as less than than I had expected. It all centers around being double charged for the room. The company I.work for ( MOT) booked the room for me through expedia and pre paid for the room so all I had to do was check in on arrival. When I arrived the desk clerk asked for my drivers licensed a credit to put on file which I did. After getting to my room I received a text alert from my bank Well Fargo that sper 8 had charged my card for the room $69.20. Not understanding why my card was being charged since the room had already been paid for I called the front desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that my card had not been charged and I was mistaken. So being confused I. Called my banks. service line and was told that yes super 8 had charged me for the room so I went to the front desk and shoed the clerk the alert from wells Fargo and explained to him I had called the bank to verify. He told me I was wrong and asked him to look into it further. After a couple of hrs with no reply I called the front desk to find out what was going on and was told that he had spoke to his manager that there had been an update on the computer system that sometimes charged a customers card but that when I checked out the next morning that the money would be returned to my card. The next morning at 4:30 am I checked out to catch a plane back to Tucson As and spoke to the new clerk at the desk about the double charge issue. She told me she had been made aware and called the company to fix the problem. I had a early flight so she said she would e mail me as soon as she took care of the issue and had my money returned. After arriving in Tucson several hrs later I checked my e mail and found no response so I called the hotel and asked to speak with the manager. After being connected to her she was not all resposive to my issue going back to the line that my card had not been charged and there was nothing she was going to do to help me. I felt she was very rude and could care less. I asked for her supervisors phone # and was told she was it.  After that I called wells Fargo and filed a claim against super 8 for double charging us for the room. The service member at wells Fargo once again checked and verified that I had indeed been charged for the room and intiated an inquiry which is suppose to take 10 to complete. The company I work for rents 400-500 roo,1
21621,"Our group of 12 did the Seine River Dinner Cruise and it was average at best.  The cost is not reflective of the value.  Positives...ship is very nice, our table was setup in the center of the dining room.  The views from the windows and top deck sailing down the Seine are really beautiful  We had an overcast and drizzly night but it did not take away from the ambience.  The food starting off with Foie Gras was surprisingly very good!  I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised.   Unfortunately the experience was marred by an initial inexperienced waiter or give him the benefit of the doubt with language barrier (mine).  However I located a waiter that understood English (Oliver) who was great from that point forward.  The wine list was limited but good, choose a nice Bordeaux for $50eur.  The cruise also included a solo singer, who was good, but because of the heat and humidity it discouraged our group from dancing.  Actually no one on the ship danced. The major issue we had was with the temperature in the dining room.  It was ridiculously warm.  Since it was drizzling, the humidity and temperature took away from the entire experience.  Additionally they could provide better directions getting to the ship.  Ubers and taxi's could actually drive right up to the ship.  To add insult to injury, I checked GroupOn and the cost for the cruise was substantially discounted.  I did not book the cruise and was just going along with the group.  Not worth the cost. Not recommended.",1

57578,"We booked a premium deluxe room for 3 nights and it was meant to be a room with a balcony and bottled water supply. Upon arrival, we found a loudly leaking toilet (refilling issues) in the room we were given and we notified the reception staff. We were asked to bring our luggage down and wait for another room allocation. Despite my comment that we have completed a very long trip from Victoria with small children and maybe it is possible to take us straight into our new room instead of going down to the reception. I was advised that we must return downstairs in order to proceed with a new room booking. We were given a new room on level one without a balcony or even a window that we can open. No bottled water was provided either. Thus, we were downgraded instead of the ""free room upgrade to an Executive room"" as advertised.  However, we received a humble apology from the staff after they asked us to leave the room, but it was unacceptable in my opinion to ask us to return to the reception area.  What could be done differently: arranging an appropriate room for us, using a luggage trolley to help us with belongings and taking them straight into the new room. If the room was downgraded - notify us prior to moving that there won't be any balcony, opening window, or bottled water and give us options (if required) to choose a different room.  Not working toilet was not our issue and instead of providing us with a better option to improve our satisfaction we were given ""whatever was there"" and no cancellation policy left us with no choice but to stay at the property.  That experience was such a disappointment! We would never stay at the Aspire hotel again nor recommend it to anyone!",1

The drain wouldn’t properly open so the water would pool at the bottom of the tub. No conditioner provided and one tiny soap provided, to be used both in the shower and to wash your hands in the sink. Even though they knew the room was for two people, only one bath towel was provided. When it came to the room, it wasn’t much better. The bed was incredibly hard and uncomfortable, and only two super thin, flimsy pillos were provided. The hallways of the hotel were dark which made it seem like it was meant to hide dirt.  I will say that the location is great, close to navigli. Regarding parking- a couple of free spots are available in front of the hotel which is very convenient, if you can get one of those spots.  Very poor experience overall compared to other NH hotels throughout europe.",1

18401,"The whole experience was terrible.  We had valet parking included, but on arrival, no one came to meet us, and we had to unpack our car and look for someone to take our keys.  That person was a bumbling mess.    We then carried our own bags in and had to ask where to check in.  The person at the entry said what are you doing with your bags?  We said we are carrying them.  They said you can leave them there if you want and we can take them.  We said yes please - we should not have had to do this - it should have been automatic.  On arrival in our room, it was dirty.  There were coffee stains/spots over the bench, and the tissue box in the bathroom had soap scum all over it and dust on the top.  One of the hot/cold buttons on the taps in the shower were missing.  The robes were very small and very tatty - they were time stamped Feb 2018, so quite old - over 5 years.  The towels were also small and rough.  I am only 5'1"" and they were small for me.  The robe fit my 8yo daughter.  A bottle of champagne was meant to be included.  We got a bottle of De Bortoli Rococo Premium Cuvee, which retails for about $12 per bottle.  The food service to the room was cold.  I was very annoyed that we had to pay 10% extra for delivery.  This price should already be included as the food is quite expensive.    The Langham charged merchant fees when paying by credit card.  This is ridiculous in this day and age when everything is paid by card, and a large hotel like the Langham should be able to absorb merchant fees.  The tiles in between the pool and spa were loose and missing grout.  I could go on.  I have photo evidence also.  The website lists information which is incorrect and completely different to the information you receive by email before checking in.  This is very misleading.  Absolutely abhorrent when you pay such a premium price and it was old, dirty, hidden charges etc.  I will never return and I will be spreading the word.    I complained about the hidden fees on checkout and they said 'You just have to pay it' but there were too many other things wrong and it was too difficult to list them all.  The reception staff also seemed not interested. ",1

22357,"The room we booked and the room we received was not the same.  Even though I booked directly with the hotel on their corporate website my receipt did not explain what room I was being charged for so I did not have proof of exact accommodation other than an exorbitant charge for two nights stay at this location.  Please be cautious when booking on their website and if you get a receipt please make sure you confirm the room you booked is accurate.    I was supposed to have a junior suite with a view of The Duomo and instead ended up looking at the back of the hotel building and the roof of the restaurant.  I paid close to $1,300.00 for one nights stay and was told that my cancellation for the first night would not be honoured even though we gave them 48 hour notice and they took well over 24 hours to communicate this was not possible and I would be charged.  I did receive a credit for some of the cost however, that was only valid in their restaurant or bar and I paid parking separate because it's privately owned.  I tried to make the best of it but there was no senior manager on duty when we checked in and checked out and had to explain or situation to many people which wasted or time especially when we arrived after 7:00PM for a single nights stay.  I stayed in four other hotels in Italy and had better rooms in three of them.   This hotel was the worst especially when you have a server at dinner hovering around trying to serve you food before you even have a chance to get a glass of water or glass of wine.  We had a busy day, wanted to relax a little and felt pressured to make a food selection before we even had a chance to enjoy the restaurant or something to drink.  This restaurant should only be open to breakfast and lunch because there is no ambiance and bright lights.  I also had to order my third wine choice at dinner because the other two bottles were not available.    I don't usually do hotel reviews but I travel for business in Canada, US and Europe and this place was beyond words.  I'm not into drama and usually suck it up but I'm compelled to share my experience.  The only thing that was really good was the breakfast and that is something they are known for so at least that information was accurate.  There are lots of other hotels in Milan and my suggestion is to make another selection if this one comes up for booking.",1

We booked a room / paid for for 3 adults when we arrived after our room was only made up for two people, including only two beds. This was resolved after speaking to reception twice a camp bed was finally brought to the room…which was very uncomfortable. We also had to ring every day to get the correct number of towels brought to the room. It felt like you had to ring serval times to get anything done, things which should be done automatically.  The room which serves breakfast is too small to accommodate the number of guest at the hotel, it is a struggle to find a table. Breakfast itself was fine.  The hotel is in a good location with a 10 Min walk to the center and the metro station literally across the road. ",1
29727,"I had a Stay Plus voucher and needed to utilize it before it expires at the end of the month.  Managed to get a room at the Grand Mercure Roxy and it has probably been half a decade ago that we last stayed at this property.    Requested for a room on a high floor but got one on the mid-floors instead.   Apart from the huge executive suites which were renovated probably a decade ago and some additions and alterations done to the F&B establishments, the other rooms have probably been left untouched from the day the hotel started operations 20 over years ago.  We were given Room 1036 which overlooked Parkway Parade.   It offered a partial sea view and the location of the hotel is great - near to the Changi International Airport and stuck between the peranakan enclave of Katong and Parkway.  Lots of options to shop, see and eat.  The location would only get better once the underground MRT line is operating.  However, the hotel has really really seen better days.  While the air-con works fantastically, the impression one gets upon entering the room is that of being transported back a couple of decades ago.  Grand Mercure Roxy Singapore is in dire need of some serious renovations.   In fact, I was shocked when I had to press both sides of lifts at the lobby in other to call for them.    This shouldn’t be happening at a time when smart devices are already a common thing.    The walls and door of the room are also so very thin.    While napping, I was awoken by the hotel staff who were happily chatting away at the corridor - how did I know? I looked through the peephole and saw a gentleman and a lady with a trolley having a great conversation outside a room asunder from mine.   I really hope the Grand Mercure could freshen up the hotel and rooms in time to welcome international guests back when traveling returns to greater normalcy.

The area appeared to be safe, and it was in a good location with shopping. The price was phenomenal, and we only needed two nights. The staff was friendly, but the cleanliness of the hotel was horrible. There was dirty hair in the bed baseboards and the carpet could use a good shampoo job. Not sure what type of ppl stayed in the hotel, but one person put notes on their door nightly, depicting that there was a peeping Tom in the hotel. One neighbor next door, yelled for help the entire night, saying he needed an ambulance and pain pills. Whenever I needed something, I made my husband go! We blesssed someone else while they were there.",1
22962,"It is a nice hotel, however, there is NO way this is a four star hotel. It is clan and neat. Book online as the reception tries to charge more for breakfast, parking ect. It is a good 2.5, 3 star at best. Not sure why it's marked four star. No pool, fitness, or anything extra, very basic and far from the city. Its a great 2 star hotel in US",1
65073,"We are a family of 5 (3 adults, 2 children) and stayed there for 6 nights in 2 rooms.  The hotel is very nice, rooms are of a good standard and most of the employees are fantastic, very polite and welcoming.  I would have surely stayed again there, only if, the only blond female receptionist is fired!  She bullied us all through our stay there, was arrogant and rude without knowing us or having any reason.  She spoke down on us and even instructed her collegue to charge us 50 pounds because my young son had a small accident and wet the bed! Have in mind that his pajamas were dry and neither he or us knew of this, but under her instructions, her collegue accused us publicly of wetting the bed, in front of others and orderd us to pay 50 pounds! When I mentioned that it may be one of the kids she realized her mistake but it was too late..she already humiliated us. If a hotel accepts kids, its obvious such accidents may happen, and the hotel should be prepared by having bed protectors on kids beds. If you have kids,dont stay there!  THey may say they accept them but under this ladys command they will charge you for such incidents.  All other staff who are indian are fantastic, they will make you feel very welcomed, but if there is a blonde at reception... be ware... she can definitely spoil your holiday experience, like she did for us.  I surely hope that the manager replaces her because other than her, the hotel is very good and I would highly reccomend it.",1
32819,"Very expensive for an aging, mediocre hotel that perhaps once was one of the top in Tokyo.  It appears they provide a free breakfast to almost everyone, so if you don't get there when it opens at 7, you face a massive crowd.  Had to ask four times to get a refill on coffee.  The staff was just overwhelmed.  Not a luxury experience.  Room was not quiet--pretty noisy.  Next time, I'll stay elsewhere.",1
25047,"Wifi is terrible. It only works in the den (near TV).  We had 3 groups in different rooms -- same experience.  Plan for zero connectivity.  We found 2 baby cockroaches alive and crawling, 1 in the bathroom + 1 in our bedroom on the comforter. The access to the Cell Block C tower -- is BIZARRE access through the car park.  The front desk staff are very odd, not helpful and lazy.  This place looks good on the outside -- but DO NOT RECOMMEND.  ",1
29500,"DO NOT STAY HERE! Horrific hotel! I had originally booked the hotel for 8 nights I stayed there for one as the condition of the hotel was bad. On arrival, the receptionist informed us that our room was under repair so we would be ""upgraded"" to a family room. However, on entry to the room, we realised that the place was incredibly dirty dingy and not well looked after. The bathroom was full of mould, and the bed linen and towels were stained with holes in them. We informed the receptionist that the bathroom was filthy and mouldy which is a health concern, he didn't really seem concerned and just said ""it's clean, there is nothing wrong with it"" I then complained to the hotel manager as all the reviews I'd read said how great the place was and I was seeing none of this (thanks to both tripadvisor.com and hotels.com for not verifying them before awarding them). I had a long-drawn-out argument with the manager who said our hotel reviews are based on location and nothing else. ""we are a boutique hotel, therefore, you expect it to be okay standards not great, you have been upgraded to a bigger room your original room was smaller"" I'm sorry the very definition of a boutique hotel is ""a small stylish hotel"", I explained that I do not care about the size of the room I just expected it to be clean and functional. I expected small I did not expect dirty, grotty and dingy. But according to him, I should have expected a grotty room with dirty, worn-out Linnen because it was a boutique hotel. save yourself and don't stay at the Arven ""boutique"" hotel! After one night we found another hotel to stay in as I could not bear the thought of spending 8 nights in the Arven.",1
18965,Hotel is ideally located for short visits & 5 minutes walk from Milan central station. Hotel reception staff are super friendly and efficient. Roons are basic but have all amenities. I had ants on bedroom floor which I reported but no response or action taken. Hotel is also under external renovation so windows are all covered up. ,1

36651,"This hotel is at walking distance from the Hagia Sophia and other important attractions, which is definitely the big advantage.  However, it goes downhill from there. Have your cell phone handy if you want to call the reception, because neither of the two phones worked in the room. Good luck taking a shower in the morning with sporadic interruptions of hot water. Also, make sure you inspect your towels before taking a shower, you might find marks you don't like.   There are a lot of boutique hotels around this place, I'd recommend looking for one with not so many problems.",1
52049,"The hotel is well situated though at 50m of the entrance in front of the station there are kind of mafia people, many battered cars and strange people around. Lots of guards in the hotel and in every corner (is it necessary?) make you wonder why...  Checking in is a bit long (they even photocopy your passport... are we in a soviet regime already?)  The rooms are nice though if you want to use the bathroom and someone prefers to sleep all the light will pass trough the glass wall .Bathroom doors are fancy but will let the noise go through the room, not good ventilation either after the shower. Not many hooks and shelfs either, you finish hanging your stuff on the flat TV.  The breakfast was too expensive for the offering. The first day we got mixed up with our local time and we couldn't get into... the waiter couldn't even smile! We ended up eating at IBIS where the offer was better but not excellent: not many breads, no saccharine, coffee machine stuck or without milk and fresh fruits were limited to 3 sorts. We got 3 fire alarms during our week stay (luckily only ""false"")  one during the night and after that you wonder if someone was tempting to smoke on the bathrooms. After that you are not allowed to use the elevators for 10 min (they say 5 min).  Only in the reception they will talk in English, maids and guards won't.",1
22269,"This hotel building js beautiful, but the overall experience is depressing. The rooms and the bathrooms are tired.

61185,"My  two friends and I  were given a tiny room with two twin beds that could not be separated since the room was too narrow. The third bed wasn't even a bed (it looked like a futon without a  back ) which was placed at the foot of the two twin beds. The bathroom door could hardly open because the room was so tiny and it had a tiny shower  which one would not be able to bend over in to wash your feet! We went back to the front desk and they gave us another room which was slightly  bigger but without air conditioning.We didn't realize this since we were told it would take a while to kick in. It was late and we were exhausted after a long travel day.The next day we were out touring all day only to come back to  a sweltering room .Again ,someone came to look at it ,and tried to fix it .The room next door was available so one of us moved in there to spread out and sleep for the night.By the third night the room next door was no longer available so once again all three of us were back in a crowded  room without air.. We spoke to front desk several times and received a call back from the manager,Mrs.Kalfopoulou who said she could reimburse us for one nights stay but it would have to come through our travel agent ,Elite World Travel .I hope we can get some reimbursement since we were miserable sleeping.On the positive side , a lovely breakfast with a wonderful employee ,Mary and a rooftop area where we could sit,",1
55517,"1. Don't ask Reception to book you a taxi. I did and particularly specified I wanted a black cab NOT a limousine.  What turned up was a limousine and as I did not have time to look for a black cab, had no choice but take the expensive route: £40 instead of £20! Next day I approached a different Desk Clerk who said they have only one way - using a limousine service. Big mistake!!  2. Make sure the  room next door does not steal your 'Don't disturb' sign as they obviously did not have one. Room Service came to clean the room while I was in the shower!!",1

5451,"When my employer asked me to come and do work here in Harare, I asked to be placed in a nice hotel, suited for business trips. They recommended the Holiday Inn Harare. I checked out the website and I was happy, it looked good, clean, close to shops etc. I am not a complainer in nature, but I feel I have to bring this to the attention of management and other people looking to stay here.  First, the good things: 1.	Nice TV 2.	Nice firm bed 3.	Overall it is clean. 4.	The air-conditioning is good 5.	The bedding is clean. 6.	I asked for a blanket and within minutes a warm nice soft blanket was delivered.  Firstly, the photos on the internet and the reality are not the same. The hotel has a cold atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful, but you really should do something to make it more welcoming. The hotel room itself is nice and specious, but really cold and in need of updating. For USD90 a night, b&b, one it not expected to find this and the following issues below.   I just came from Mozambique, where I stayed in the Radisson Blu Maputo and Zambia Lusaka where I stayed in the Pamodzi hotel. For the same price these two hotels are very much higher-market, updated and value for money, extremely friendly and welcoming staff and just 2 great places overall.  •	The toilet area is dark, the bath/shower feels yucky and small. Please consider getting better lighting in the bathroom. •	The taps really need replacement.   •	The towels feel like they came out of the 80’s.  •	There are not enough hangers in the closet •	The closet door doesn’t slide open, you must lift and push it. Then it sounds like you are breaking down the door. •	There is no plug where the kettle is – you must move the kettle around. •	The coffee is cheap, and there was the coffee creamer was not replaced on Tuesday. •	There are not enough drawers for longer staying guests.  •	The hairdryer is poor. The hairdryer cord is short and once you find a plug for it, you cannot get to a mirror. •	The window barely opens, you also must lift and push with might to get it open. •	As stated, the staff is friendly and helpful, but one gets the feeling they do not want to be disturbed or go out of their way. •	I feel sorry for the waitering staff at the breakfast, they run around trying their best, but: •	The breakfast buffet has been the same each day – I will not recommend anyone to take the breakfast option – food is bland in uninteresting.  •	Covid is still with us yes, but really – we are adults, we can dish up for ourselves. Why do we need to be dished up for like children? •	Also, there are not enough tables in the restaurant during breakfast. I had to run around for a spot, just to return with a plate of food, and my spot was taken up by another guest (no offence to the other guest) •	I paid upfront for the 2 weeks stay. Last night my colleagues and I went down to the bar for drinks. I asked them to put it on my hotel room tab. They came back saying they don’t have my credit card details on system, so I have to settle my account before I leave the bar. Really – Am I going to run away during the night without checking out? We are professional people. I have never ever in all my travel had to be treated like that – it was embarrassing.  •	Again with the COVID for some reason, there is no room service menu. Due to COVID, they stopped the service...Really – the last thing I want to do is run around for dinner after a long day at the office. The room service person said he can arrange for room service, but will have to read the menu to me of what is available. No thank you. •	There are two shelves where I assume TV’s were mounted to…the TVs are not mounted to the wall – why not remove them and hang a picture? It really is a cold place. •	The gap in the wall for the safe is too big. It just looks unneat. Some of us are spending a week, 2 weeks here, we want to look at nice things. It is depressing. •	One of the bedside lamp’s globe flickered, so I unscrew it – do random checks to see if the items still work. •	The standing lamp’s head/shade really is leaning to the side – tighten it or replace it. It really also looks like it had enough of this sadness. •	Also, my colleague checked out today – he has not had hot water since he stayed here – he requested more than once that it be checked into, but no help or change in the situation. That is not nice. He moved to another hotel for the duration of our stay.  The hotel serves it’s purpose. It is not the Holiday Inns I remember from when, as a child, we spend our holidays in. It is not a friendly, welcoming hotel. For USD90 p/n, I am sure that it can be better.   Please see this as possible feedback, I know you can do better. Currently it feels more like a hostel than a nice hotel, a home away from home. Make your foreign guests, who are alone in your country, a foreign country, feel more at home, welcomed and appreciated. Please.  With all due respect. Again, the staff only do what they can. Treat them well too please.  .",1

35873,"Terrible experience with the manager. Manager was completely lying about having a no refund policy and completely had the capacity to provide refund. Absolutely says ""following a script"" in regards to their policy with Expedia but what kind of modern hotel doesn't provide that refund?  In this day and age, you would expect hotels to provide a reasonable refund policy that's set 30 days away but of course, you meet individuals like this who have something up in the rear about following rules dogmatically.  If you can't give the refund, don't freaking lie about that up front saying you have absolutely no idea. You talked to an Expedia representative literally 10 seconds prior to the phone call so don't lie about that. It's ridiculous how some people lie and pretend like they have 0 freaking idea and get so blatantly caught in a lie.",1
38536,"Initial reactions were very impressive. Hotel looked great, facilities and grounds were well appointed and staff were helpful and attentive. Great location, small vendors, restaurants and mini marts only a short walk down the hill.  We stayed 10 nights where I think 7 would have been plenty. Rooms are a decent size, a little tired and dull in some areas but good value for the price. We could hear a lot of footsteps and noise from the floors above and at times it became annoying, especially when trying to sleep.   Towards the last few days of our stay I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and would never return to this hotel. 90% of the staff were great, unfortunately a certain few were rude especially in and around the restaurant for breakfast and dinner buffets. Was attacked a few times upon leaving the restaurant as to whether I’d signed for meal and drinks, although dinner and breakfast was included in our stay, but happily paid for drinks.  We were spoken to quite harshly in front of the children and not one ounce of pleasantry was afforded by these certain few in question.  Same can be said at breakfast where head chef whose name I won’t mention, let’s call him Voldemort, was rude and never greeted either myself of my children with any respect. Although witnessing his behaviour with his fellow countrymen there was an instant smile and he couldn’t do enough to help.  3 days before we were due to checkout I received a letter in my room about needing to pay the outstanding bill thus far. Apparently I had reached the limit of my spend and was unable to charge anything more to the room until I’d paid. Not more than 10 mins after I’d read the letter the front desk rang and rang harassing me to come and pay.  I went down to sort it out, some charges did not include the 20% discount that we were assured was on ALL purchases on food and drink made at the hotel. The front desk staff became condescending and blunt at this point.  They wanted me to pay at least half the outstanding amount then and there. I was shocked at the level of unprofessionalism and was made to feel like I was a criminal that couldn’t pay and was being held to ransom.  Needless to say I paid the whole amount and did not spend another cent in the hotel for the next 3 days!!  An unfortunate end to what initially was a great stay.  ",1

65478,"Convenient for Harajuku and Shibuya. We were in transit, landing at Haneda and picking up again at Narita with 17 hours in between, or so we thought. We took the train to the hotel, as bus only half hourly so we'd have to wait. We decided to get off at Harajuku, supposedly closer, still takes about 10 mins with  suitcase. Forget the zizag direction on Google maps, just follow the main road and turn right. Its down hill so not so bad. Getting to Narita, decided to take the express train without need to change. Cost about 3K Yen and cash only, and we had just enough, thank goodness, there is no place close to do fx which means missing the train. Also, exp train only leaves from Shibuya and taxi there from hotel about 900 yen.  Check out time is 11am and we didn't know then until we went to ask for extension, which were then told its 1k yen per hour. So we quickly got out. Another thing, hotel has a nice spa, i.e. hot soaking tub. Remember to follow the rules if not familiar. What I didn't know was you need to take the towels from your room and I found out the hard way.",1
49812,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The hotel cleanliness, was excellent. Location was ideal. Reception staff was helpful and knowledgeable. The only noticeable downside was the roof terrace experience. There was one particular member of staff who was so rigid and seemed stressed when asked to facilitate changes such as moving two chairs into an additional table. He expressed his dissatisfaction with us moving two chairs into our table. In a second interaction with him he served us a different tap beer than requested and pretended it was the right one. This was visibly a “ cloudy” beer not a “blond” my husband seek reassurance, the staff said my husband was wrong and that “ that was the blond beer”…. Only after asking confirmation for a 3rd time did this staff admitted the “ blond beer tap was not working/run out and my husband had been served the tap next to”  . We felt quite annoyed he had attempted to mislead us and make us feel we were in the wrong when it was such an easy situation to deal with he had he suggested from the beginning an alternative drink. A third interaction with him lead us to not return to the roof bar on our last 2 nights. As he ignored my husband while waiting at the bar and went to attend other customers that were after my husband. My husband did not say anything but the customer behind pointed this out to the staff who said “ no, he wasn’t before you” and continued to attend other customers. I personally feel this is a sign not only of poor quality customer service training that could easily be alleviated, but of rudeness and poor personal skills. In addition, not pleasant was the choice of background music in the pool bar, it was just awful, very loud, electronic, high repetitive beat, I was expecting to be accompanied by laser light show any minute!…..really poor choice for such a great setting, not inviting to a chill, trendy atmosphere… it felt we were in a Rave …as much as we would have liked to stay longer at the terrace bar and enjoy more food & drinks  the choice of music made the whole experience very uncomfortable",1

63637,We stayed with a group for a high school's sport team trip to SF. This hotel is conveniently located in Fisherman's Wharf and walking distance to Ghirardelli Square. Plenty to see and do in the immediate area and a nice walk to the Golden Gate Bridge.  The rooms and hotel is updated and modern.  The fitness center was nice and we used it daily.  We did not have time for the pool.  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant where they had a buffet and menu service.  Starbucks is around the corner.  Valet parking was convenient and there are 24/7 public parking options just a few blocks away.       ,1
3137,"This is a very badly run 5* hotel. Facilities are OK, and pool has a lovely view, but this doesn’t hide the fact that the staff are not looking to provide a 5* service - and you can feel that from the moment you check in.   In just a 2 day stay I had to move room because I was eaten alive on the first night, my suitcase (and clothes) got soaked whilst I was out of the room, and items were lost from laundry. In all cases the hotel corrected the issue, but did not make think about the inconvenience caused and what they could do to “make up for it”.  It’s basic poor service and with the wrong values instilled in with staff.  In a city where there are so many amazing 5* hotels this is one to avoid. You’ll only be disappointed.",1

The first time we called and the girl fixed it within about 5 mins, but the second night we called and the girl said she needed to get a guy to fix it, but by then it would have been too late so we couldn't use it. The next morning we went back to our room and there was a man out cleaning/fixing the Jacuzzi so I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the Jacuzzi based on this.   The location is perfect. You get a nice sunrise view and its about a 2 min walk into the town. The breakfast has a great variety I have a few allergies and they were accommodating.

58818,"Stayed for a week and need another holiday to get over this one.  Very frustrated by the constant noise at the hotel- the entertainment crew love nothing more than screaming, shouting, blowing whistles and slapping foam sticks on the water to irritate the guests. This drove me mad- I wanted a quiet week by the pool relaxing. Ha! No such luck! The activities seemed alright although poorly attended and not very timely- energetic dancing at 12 noon is not really going to entice me into getting off my sunbed.  The entertainment crew were rather young. The girls seemed pleasant enough but were very selective about who they spoke to, to join in their activities. The boys however were very immature, rude, arrogant and just annoying. They sped around the pool on rollerblades blowing whistles and shouting at the top of their lungs. Using shaving foam on people sunbathing was just pathetic and they were not perturbed by the guests clearly being offended by their inappropriate and childish behaviour.  There were very few english people there and most of the staff spoke only a very small amount of english if at all. I personally had to wait for 3 receptionists to speak to someone who spoke enough english to understand me.  The evening entertainment was pretty average. The entertainment crew did most evenings which was where it fell down- attempting to put on a show they simply were not skilled to do. Every event was started by an introduction of each element in 5 languages (sometimes 4 languages when they decided english was not needed). Needless to say this took time. entertainment was set to start at 21:45hrs.... nothing actually got going until 22:30hrs at the earliest.  On a positive note- the rooms were clean and maids came daily and changed the towels every day whether they needed it or not. The food was a bit hit and miss. Some things were great- others were really not! Undercooked meat was not pleasant and the over cooked meat a crying shame to ruin some lovely looking beef and lamb. The chef making fresh pancakes and doughnuts was very nice and being able to choose your own omelette fillings was also nice. But that is about where it stops :( Thank goodness for the fab weather and the pool (although in need of a good clean) as without it I'm not sure I'd have wanted to stay all week.",1
25924,"I would not recommend this place to anyone who is interested in a good nights sleep or has young children with an early bedtime. Our first  night here the room above us had what sounded to be elephants running around until 3am. This happened again on our last night here as well. People in the hallway/corridor seem to have no respect for people sleeping at any hours of the night. The front desk was called and we were told security would speak with them to quiet down, but this seemed to do nothing. The units has plenty of space but need a good cleaning. Our porch was covered in ashes. The only good thing I can say about this place is that it is conveniently located to some shops and parks.",1

Old building, furnishings and decor.   The positives. Good location Clean room.",1
32095,"first off we paid $400 for Sunday-Wednesday which is understandable because I thought it was going to be a top tier hotel because it’s apart of the Hilton. I was mistaken! There were stains on the sheet floor and some of the towels, the tv didn’t work for a whole day and kept losing signal, the heat wasn’t working at first so we had to have housekeeping come and mess with it so it would finally work not to mention it took housekeeping about 20 minutes before they even came. I constantly kept smelling dog throughout our room I had to spray multiple times just to try and get rid of the smell. and throughout the lobby and hallways was this very strong perfume scent that took my breath away and I know they used that to mask the horrible smell of animal. There were huge stains on the carpet in the hallway and the elevator was dirty a couple of times with someone’s food they had spilled. we had to request housekeeping so we were without towels and toilet paper for a whole day because you can’t request housekeeping after 10 smh. But Pretty much we won’t ever stay here again we pretty much paid all that money for the appliances in the room because the hotel itself was disgusting and I would not recommend staying here. ",1
60057,"Warning: This hotel is unbelievably noisy! And staff (inc. management) simply do not care about that whatsoever.   The hotel may just about scrape into 4-star level for it's facilities and feel, but that is completely and utterly negated by the loud noise issues you have to continually deal with when staying here.   It is *extremely* badly designed as a hotel, so that most rooms face onto two noisy pools, where music is played on and off throughout the day. They then have noisy music most nights as well, which when adding the normal of people drinking and making more noise on top of this (often well into the early hours!), means noise levels get completely unbearable for other guests who want a quiet night in their rooms to – you know– sleep!   This all means that if you want to go to your room for peace and quiet or simply to get some proper sleep, you simply cannot escape the noise happening literally right outside your balcony until whatever hour!   I paid for so-called 'deluxe' room, only to find these are some of the closest to the source of this noise?! Who on earth designing this place, thought that was a good idea? It certainly isn't; it's cheap an nasty.   I'm on holiday. I want rest & relaxation, not 1990's 18-30s style loudness going on ALL THE DAMN TIME.   Yes, obviously I made mgmt aware of the noise issues, but all they did was brush it under the carpet as 'normal'. IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT NORMAL. Especially when you're charging nearly £300/night room rates as a 4-star level hotel.   Spend the extra and stay nearby in the Annabelle or Almyra (or cheaper others on the Poseidon Avenue strip).   Avoid this place if you crave your sanity.",1

52975,"If you are staying for more than a week I would not recommend this hotel.   We booked 6 nights in April, upon check-in the hotel assigned a room has dirty window and view is blocked by a concrete wall, we requested a room change since we are staying for 1 week, after waiting for over an hour we got another room, the other room was not better, it has terrible view facing a construction site, not only construction noise commenced in early morning but workers can see through the window which prevent us from opening the curtain during our entire stay. The hotel cannot do anything about this problem which we understand, however we expect the management (if they have) could do a better job accommodating long stay guest's needs as this is normal practice in all hotels.   We booked the package with buffet breakfast, their restaurant is located next to the lobby, we were served with some sausage and egg in THREE chafing dishes, bare minimum quantity in each container, hot coffee served with no milk no sugar but cold simple syrup, if we knew in advance about this quality and quantity, we'd be better off to fast food outside, we expected to have 'BUFFET' for breakfast, nothing complicated but a proper breakfast buffet in Asian standard.   We are quite surprised the hotel or hotels.com has scammed us for the buffet breakfast, it is less than a half of what they displayed on their website, when we complain to the hotel staff, the staff said he isn't responsible but will follow up with the restaurant manager, we never heard anything from the hotel since then and no one has approached us to handle our complaint.   The Nine Tree hotel is lacking service recovery and communication, they are not ready and not prepared for long stay guest, if you will unfortunately encounter any issue or have to complain, the current team of this hotel is incompatible to resolve in a professional manner.

35232,The hotel had a lovely view and that was all. It was a 3 star dive with no air conditioning – I had no idea it would be so hot in Paris.  But I had a fan. I lived on water in ice buckets from the bar downstairs. I stupidly left the window open the first night and found my ceiling covered in small insects when I went to bed. The night reception guy I went to see to get some insect spray could not assist me. What a terrible hotel. The hotel was very old and tired. Some attempts to renovate were evident but they were cheap superficial - like painting over cracks. Today this hotel barely qualifies for its grading but for the price I have maximum convenience for location. I could not be more in the centre of where I want to go - but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone else - they would deserve something better.,1

My husband and I arrived early at 11am which we understand is very early. We “checked” in at 130pm and gave our credit card and got charged but they still did not give us a key or a room and multiple time was told “my colleague is checking” which meant no one was doing anything. Colleague was checking all the way until 3pm still no room while we waited in the lobby.  This is fine however we saw at least 12 other guests get checked in between 1-3pm while we waited in the lobby. The most unhelpful receptionists.

He is still in the Intensive Care Unit at Breach Candy Hospital, Mumbai India.   I requested the hotel to refund us the money after deducting some % as cancelation charges, though they do not have the same in their cancelation policy.  But this a life saving medical emergency leading to cancelation of the booking.   Intially one Ms. Kamila told me she would speak to her superiors if I would send them some proof. So I forwarded the running bill of the Hospital.  Later on one Ms. Marina flatly refused to do anything.  Our Athens stay was refunded with 33% being cancelation charges at Metropolis Hotel, Athens.

Despite assuring that we could have a coffee maker in the room, there is not and the reception denied what they said initially. The “room service” stops at the breakfast time (beginning 6.30)and therefore it is impossible to have a coffee in the room. Asking explanations ….the answer was “it is how it is”. The kindness and the availability of the personnel is at the lower limit. The general impression is that they are more embarrassed by tourists than keen to receive them.

34211,"I decided to pick this hotel for three main reasons: the reputation, the online reviews, and the nice building; however, as all things that go awry after its harmless facade, this hotel turned out to be the biggest nightmare of our trip.   For those of you who just don’t care about the twisted aspects of the building's design (apparently I can't talk about it on Trip Advisor), well there’s always the case of bed bugs. After the first night, which both of us had nightmares, my companion had bite marks all over her leg. It was really really itchy and red, and she felt ill. The front desk and manager thought it may have been allergies from the food we ate, but it clearly wasn’t as it was only found on one particular area of her leg and clearly looked like bite marks, with two pincer markings. Feel free to discuss and judge amongst yourself what they are (see photos). The hotel insisted on downplaying it and saying everything was fine, this was unusual, yadi-yadi-yada. So they offered to change our room, that is, to the room directly across from where we were already staying. Well better than nothing, we had so naively thought. So we moved into the new room.   As we were just about to settle in, we saw something moving from the reflection of the window. The horrible and poor design of the hotel enabled us to see directly into our neighbor’s room, and them into ours (see photo). Good thing the little child and his mom didn’t see me undressing. Okay, so I guess no night view for us. Not a big deal. As I was puffing my pillow, I noticed something small fly out to the bedside table next to me. Upon closer look, it was definitely a stage 1 baby bed bug. (See photo) Wow! Clearly this hotel has a bed-bug infestation problem. I quickly killed it. My companion and I did a complete flashlight inspection of the bed, checked all corners, and dusted everything with our hands just to be sure (but how can you ever be sure with these things). When we were exhausted and didn’t bother to move again, we called it a night. That night, it turned out to be one of the worst nights in our whole China-trip. As we were falling asleep late into the night, we felt the presence of this long-black haired lady dressed in white seething at us from the bathroom area, and both of us immediately had the chills. We kept trying to ignore it. Finally when we fell asleep, we both experienced nightmares, again.  In the morning, we packed our luggages and sprinted out trying to check-out of the hotel as quickly as we could. We didn’t even want to tell the manager at that moment because we felt that every second we stayed in the hotel, we felt more and more physically and emotionally drained and disgusted. When we reached home, my companion kept having fevers from the bed bugs, and her bite marks became inflamed and worse. We went to see a doctor immediately and he said it was definitely some damned bed bug. We notified the hotel about this matter but they have refused to acknowledge it (some kind of “5-star” hotel) and refused to compensate us one bit (no free nights, discounts, medical expenses, etc.).  Ultimately, as a fellow traveler who was duked into thinking this was a nice hotel due to all the nice reviews and brand name, I left utterly disappointed. “If you see something, say something.” Maybe we were just the unlucky ones, but I wouldn’t want anyone to experience the dreadful things we experienced at this hotel. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I have saved you from a long line of headaches.",1
58056,"Stayed 4 nights in this hotel, as part of a tour group. Actually attended a 2 day medical symposium. Room that I had was a standard one , since it doesn’t have a bathtub. No bidet in the toilet. But amenities were just ok, and that includes the bed and Tv. Don’t expect river , bridge or square plaza views, since you’ll be seeing the courtyard from my vantage point. Lobby and restaurant seem spacious. Looks elegant to say the least , in a modernised finish. Wifi was free and has a strong presence. Breakfast buffet has somewhat extensive choices, and dishes are tasty. Not bad for its category as a 4 star hotel , which has a history of being a Jewish building before. Staff are polite particularly those in restaurant area. Several incidents however, was when they placed a note on my bed , demanding I report to front desk immediately, when apparently they have mistaken me for some other guests, and they did that when a “do not disturb “ sign was placed on the door knob. Another incident was when a lady organiser confronted me at the restaurant for using the toilet at the function room area. And to think we are delegates there as well. Parting shot , I still liked the hotel , and the location is very strategic , particularly for shoppers and those who don’t mind long walks.",1
3287,"The hotel is lovely, but unfortunately the communication between our room and the front desk was bad and the room service was very, VERY slow.   We booked through Trailfinders, and were told we had been given a honeymoon special offer of a bottle of wine and a fruit platter on arrival. Lovely! We hoped to have a glass and some fruit as we freshened up after the flight and got ready to head out. However, on arrival there was nothing in our room, so we phoned down - told they would check and send it up. 40 mins later, still no sign, so we phoned again and told same again. Another 40 mins, and we were ready to head out and bored of waiting. On our way out we let the front desk know, and asked if they could just leave it in our room. She said of course, and that she would put a 'rush' on it and it would be there when we got back... it wasn't. 2 hours later when we popped back after dinner, again thinking some wine and fruit would be perfect before heading back out, there was still nothing there. I asked at 7pm and was told it was on its way to the room now. Great. 7 30, asked again. They checked with the kitchen and said the delay was the preparation of the fruit platter and it would be 10 mins max. 25 minutes later it finally arrived. Photo of the fruit platter that took FIFTY mins to prepare below!! This had now been an hour we had been sat in the room waiting for an unopened bottle and plate of whole bits of fruit. Who knows how long it would take if you ordered a meal to your room, that requires actual preparation.  We first asked for this at 3pm, and received it at 8pm. We had to chase it 5 times. So, a frustrating start to the trip which meant a lot of waiting around, and a lot of up and down to reception. ",1
33163,"Me and my husband stayed there for 5 days to celebrate his birthday. One of the very few positive things related to this hotel was the organisation of a birthday dinner for him by the concierge Roberta. She was almost the only person at this hotel who knows what the customer service is and what it means for the future.  Apart from the location of the hotel which is on the beach there is not much nice things to say. It definitely needs a renovation or at least they should change the rugs in the halls which are full of stains.  Regarding the staff: Most of them are quite rude and they don't know anything about how to serve the customers. The person who is supposed to be the manager sitting next to the concierge complained that i was in a bikini. Somebody has to remind him where he is working and what would happen if the guests stop coming to the hotel because of his rude and inacceptable behaviour. In the same day when we returned to talk to the concierge about the day tours as i couldn't finish the conversation because of his complaints earlier, he murmured himself some stuff commenting on what we said by himself. You don't do this anywhere if you are not 5 years old and have some manners.  You cannot accept much from a hotel if the so called manager is acting like this but the person who is working in the reception was also quite rude. We wanted to change some money but either he did not understand us as French is the only foreign language he seemed to know he was at the end arguing with us that it is not possible what we wanted to do and was showing us a paper from a bank written in French although we repeatedly said we don't know French. They don't even take their time as a 4 star hotel to print the same paper in German and English. I feel lucky that i don't meet people like him that often.  The staff in the restaurant act like they are doing a favour by serving you. You have to call them to ask for coffee or something to drink at lunch and dinner. Although they see that you just arrived and sit and they are supposed to come and ask what you want to drink they just stay where they are and chat with each other.   The other staff serving in the bar mostly does not even smile. It seems like they hate their job and cannot stand it and they might see the tourist as a reason for that but they should also think about what would they do if no one prefers to go there anymore.  When you are in a bikini they also look at you in a way that is kind of disturbing.  All in all it was the worst service I have experienced so far in a hotel and the only positive thing was the location and i would definitely not return to this hotel in case i would decide to go to Djerba again.",1
13517,So the room is typical size for a Parisian hotel. But first impressions in the lobby are not great. It looks tired and a little uncoordinated and lacking that French style. The room I had was the noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in. You could hear every word the people above me were saying and footsteps and doors closing were really loud.   I would not recommend this hotel sadly mainly because of the noise.  ,1

24083,"My husband and I spent 6 nights here on a first-time trip to Hong Kong. Hotels in the city are extremely expensive. We're not backpackers looking for a hostel, either. We are a middle-aged couple who normally spends at least $150 USD per night on a hotel room. Although most people probably would choose to stay in the TST area on their first trip to HK, we chose the Dorsett Mongkok because it seemed like a good alternative location for a reasonable price. The location was in fact quite good, being walking distance to Ladies' Market and the Langham Place mall, along with easy access to MTR to get you to any other areas of HK you may want to go. As for the property itself, this was definitely a case of you get what you pay for. The room was very small - like difficult to maneuver around the bed small. It was challenging finding places for our electronic devices as there was only one nightstand and only one outlet near the bed. The ""closet"" was small glass cabinet attached to the desk. Fortunately there was a large window ledge where we were able to put our suitcases. The desk was small and only provided enough space for one person to eat at a time. The other person had to eat in bed. The bathroom was very small with almost no space on the sink to put toiletries. The shower an okay size, but I really disliked that it had a shower curtain. I wish hotels would get rid of these unsanitary germ traps altogether. At one point we asked for additional towels and noticed that one of the ones provided had a large hole in it. The room seemed clean but it had definitely seen better days. Overall, it was just very difficult for two people to live in that space for a week. The hotel's restaurant was closed during our stay and so the hotel offered a boxed breakfast delivered to your room for an additional fee, which we purchased. We were expecting a box with perhaps some pastries, fruit, and yogurt. We were surprised that a hot breakfast was delivered each day, although the word ""hot"" doesn't really apply. Although the hotel made a nice effort to provide variety by offering a different breakfast selection each day, the quality of the breakfasts was very poor. Some examples - a cold sandwich with untoasted buttered bread containing a cold fried egg and a slice of ""mystery meat,"" the most flavorless congee we've ever had, unintentionally cold noodles with three cold chicken wings, etc. Fortunately we are not vegetarians because no consideration was made at all with regard to that. There is a McDonald's across the street as well as numerous other restaurants in the area, so do yourself a favor and skip the breakfast box. Even stuff from 7/11 would have been better. One nice thing was that the restaurant provided several coupons for free meals with partnering restaurants during our stay - one for a dim sun platter at a place at Metro Harbour Plaza and another for a barbecue pork platter for a restaurant in TST. We used both coupons (they even honored them for takeaway) and both meals were good. The staff at the front desk were friendly and professional. Overall, this would be an okay place to spend a night or two, but I would reconsider for longer stays.",1

However the food was not well displayed so it was hard to see what was available. There was only one server for most of the time we were there so there were queues and people chasing coffee. Tables were not laid and requests for cutlery met with ‘it’s on the table’ which it was not as tables were not laid. Overall a poor experience and poor value for money.

54521,"This apartment was fine for a short stay in Tokyo. The pros? Relatively good value, close to a subway station, very clean, good options for families of different sizes (our kids slept on the futons and loved it), the washing facilities on the ground floor were really helpful and there were lots of places to eat within a short walk. The cons? The room was smaller than the pictures on the website indicated and as you couldn’t open the windows more than a couple of inches it soon felt a bit stuffy and claustrophobic for a family of four. This didn’t matter too much as we were out and about for most of the day but something to be aware of. Our neighbours above were super noisy on noisy on our last night which was a real nuisance - stomping about, kids jumping up and down and screaming, yelling parents. Unfortunately the receptionist leave at 9pm so there was no one to talk to about it - and the noise went on until close to 1am. We also found the receptionists polite but there was no warmth or interest - they never asked how our stay was or how our trip was going. These things count when you’re choosing a smaller property and it would have made our experience more enjoyable. That said, the apartment did what it said on the tin and was completely fine for our family of four. Would I stay again? Probably not, simply because of the sound and size issues. ",1
46032,This one night stay was a nice stay but unfortunately didnt end well.we Went to bed only to find two single beds put together with a wafer  thin mattress. We was informed due to access of the rooms beds needed to be put together like this .After having the worst night sleep myself and my husband went to speak to the manager. We was told our next stay would be at a much better rate due to the issue. I sent my first email to book another stay for  later this year and was told someone would get back to me. A month or so later and still no reply I sent another email only to be ignored again. My third email was sent not so long ago with a reply that someone will get back to me. Three emails ignored. This is the worst customer communication I have ever experienced. I have tried to call but no one has picked up. The boat itself is beautiful and has high standards. It's a shame that the people who deal with this side of things lack in customer care and are just outstandingly rude.,1

44575,"When we looked online we thought it was going to be a classy, hot, enjoyable place to go with the family. The pros of this place: it’s clean, and the staff are helpful and kind and it has a fantastic water park. Now everything ells. Where to start: firstly every building smells like bleach, the beds are rock hard and caused my brother to have a bad back, and the air con doesn’t work in the room. Secondly: The main restaurant is manic meaning there is no organisation and by the end there’s hardly any food left and ends up being luke warm to cold and due to the unorganised nature there is food on the floor. Overly crowded meaning there is not much seating. Thirdly: The towel operation makes no sense (if you decide to come bring your own towels). Fourthly: the entertainment is mediocre with a simple taste in music. Not the hotels fault but the weather wasn’t great on the first day and birds kept me up. In conclusion if you have small kids and are looking for a slightly less classy family hotel that mass produces, then take your chances.",1

When asked it the tables were free they said the guests were currently getting their food at the buffet. Once a table was empty for an hour and the waiter kept saying it was occupied to the other guests.  Beach full of dirty glasses and BROKEN pieces of glass in the sand.  Pool bar almost never open and had no ice.  Indoor pool was always being used for kids swimming courses.  Use of room safe has to be paid for.  No drinking water in the rooms.  Dirty rugs on the halls.  Absolutely nobody speaks English. French yes and if your lucky German.  The only good experience was with Roberta the concierge: Very nice and helpful. It is a pity the rest of the hotel staff doesn't come even near to the level of customer service she has. She also organised a dinner table and a pick-up at the airport with a motiv for my birthday",1
23350,"Hotel is in a great location directly at the lake, just separated by the highway (there are underpasses and pedestrian bridges to get on the other side and enjoy a stroll/morning run at the lake!).  The appearance of the hotel is a bit like a motel: central car parking with two long stretched buildings next to it. Rooms are on two floors on each side of the car park. Interior is slightly outdated, however functional.  Rooms do provide a small fridge (although reception staff didn't know about this and couldn't provide central cooling storage for an item we brought that needed refrigeration). Also a TV and pretty loud AC is available.  Free parking is provided on come first basis.",1

42316,"This is my first time staying at this property after a number of trips to Zhuhai.  The rooms are very spacious, clean and very quiet (my own prime criterion for a room while traveling).  The restaurant has outstanding buffets, although the dinner buffet was a little pricey ($40 US) .  the ala carte menu was not so exciting and could use a refresh perhaps, although the soup and sandwich I ordered were nice.  The gym is a reasonable size and the equipment was in good shape.  Finally, as noted above, the location is a bit isolated.  There are few choices in the vicinity for dining or shopping, although judging by the amount of construction that will change soon.  If you're looking for amenities and are not concerned about nearby restaurants, etc. this is a fine choice.",1
7741,"Nice rooms. Clean and tidy. Staff Are friendly and  helpful. Good location close to shops, subway and parks. Bit of street noise but not unbearable. Down side. Rooms are small with only a double bed. We are on 3rd floor and no lift. Breakfast is available at sister hotel next door called the Phoenix . Disappointed is a cost for breakfast but is  free if you stay at the phoenix. ",1
50708,"Rooms are very old and need maintenance, wooden flooring tiles have chipped everywhere, and you can hurt yourself with these wooden chips.  Food, we waited at the restaurant Seagull for 15 minutes no one attended to us, then we went to an empty table on our own and sat there, even then no one attended to us we had to call waiters and enquire about food options.  we opted for the lunch buffet, and the food was very average, we ordered paratha after following up 3 times and waiting for 30 minutes still we didn't get then we opted for rice, and after finishing up the lunch we got parotta. It was the same case at the breakfast buffet. We had ordered dosa and had to follow up 3 times to get it, in the end, we waited there at the counter and got dosa. THAT WAS WHEN WE DECIDED NOT TO EAT AT THIS TAJ ANYMORE.  Will not recommend this place to anyone as there are a lot of other options available in ECR. if you are an Epicure member don't even think about going here and redeeming an F&b discount voucher, it's pain here.",1

Why clean the room and take the towels and don’t leave any more?

33056,"When you enter any establishment being greeted with a smile sets the tone for everything. I was greeted with a hostile guest which rubbed off on the staff members and in turn made my checkin uncomfortable. Then the staff members told us Pool was on 8th floor, my children get in their suits go to the pool to find it was not even filled or in service. We rented premium rooms with snacks and drinks got in to our room and found no drinks or snacks. The valet man in the evening was far from friendly. I also did not like how they would park my vehicle with hazards on and left unlocked on the street. Crime rate in Chicago is always high it would be a good suggestion to lock the vehicles rather than leaving them unattended and unlocked. Our room smelled like marijuana and yes I get it’s legal in the state however can you not circulate some fresh air into the ventilation system? The view was amazing but I was less than impressed with this stay. ",1
3643,"Good for sleeping in quiet place, but not good enough to eat in. Room was clean with good services, 2 free water bottle every day and pool was nice ... But food was so good in thailand that the breakfeast and diner purpose in the hotel seems fade, not a lot of fruits on the breakfeast, when you see on market the choice there is you can ask you but why?. Diner: we eat one time it was not bad but not so good and second day when we came back a 9:30 they tell us it's too late for diner which was suppose to close at 10...so we eat all the week outside and it was the better thing to do to travel through the large choice and flavor of thai food (just 3 restaurant in less than 150m from the hotel have fantastic food/streetfood/seafood to serve).",1
55336,"I am a lifetime platinum Marriott Bonvoy member-  I have spent a great deal of time at Marriott properties and obviously have brand loyalty.  While in a great location, this property falls short by a lot, especially given the price point.  Staff at the front desk were cold and inattentive, leaving me standing expectantly for several minutes while ignored by them, finally getting a ‘what do you want’ nod from one of them and then a point to a box to drop my key.  The room itself was dark with incredibly poor lighting to the point I truly felt like I was in a cave - even in the bathroom.  The tap in the bathroom dispensed lukewarm and hot water- there was no cold water to be had for drinking.  Lastly, the soap dispenser in the shower was empty.  While I applaud efforts to be eco-friendly, a hotel room must still be a functional space.  Unfortunately, a co-worker stayed at the same property at my suggestion so we could ride to our final destination together, and had a similarly poor experience.  I cannot recommend a stay here.",1

36963,"I have held back from leaving this review as the staff tried very hard but I feel that it would be dishonest not to say anything. This hotel is not 5 star.    The room was basic (our upper level bedroom was so poorly appointed with a sloping ceiling that you were in danger of banging your head one of the most depressing bedrooms I have ever stayed in) as was the food.  The bathroom plumbing smelt of sewage so you could smell drains when brushing your teeth.  The restaurant meal we had once was vastly overpriced and under portioned.   I was extremely disappointed and could not wait to get home. To think we paid Eur 3,700 for a week makes me weep.",1

The restaurant was fully booked so we didn’t eat there but after reading reviews we are glad we didn’t. Breakfast in the morning was very poor!! No tables, no plates, no fried egg….. even the food that was there, was horrible. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone or book here again.",1

61054,The hotel was priced well and the room were fine but some of the COVID 19 policies need to be removed.  Information on what to do in Austin shouldn’t be hidden away down a hallway. Coffee/tea should be available all day in the lobby and it’s time to stop wrapping every item of food up to be microwaved.  Time to add bread and fruit back on the menu.  ,1
33146,"In general, the rooms and the hotel was fine. All meals have been served as buffets. They  have been quite good with fresh cooked food. Choosing hot food from plates, it usually turned out quite cold. In December, you need a sunny  and calm day to use the outside restaurant area for meals. The pool outside was as expected to cold to swim. However the indoor swimming pool we liked. Really, we enjoyed the hammam and the massages. I personally totally disliked the main sitting and bar area, since smoking was allowed inside. The smoking was so heavy, that I could not recommend the hotel for non-smokers.",1
31114,"This hotel is clean and well appointed but it is the noisiest and hottest hotel on the planet. This hotel doesn’t have any individual room climate control so you have to open a window to avoid burning up. With an open window you can hear the entire city of Rome, from traffic noise to fireworks, you get ALL the noise. We moved our room to see if it was quieter on the other side but it was only a slight difference, still hot and noisy. The staff was nice and the location is good but we will never return or recommend this hotel",1

39368,"We paid $1000 AUD per night, minimum 4 nights, for this hotel because of the reported fireworks view.  That's for a hotel that typically goes for $200 or so AUD per night.  You'd think for that price, they'd really do it up for New Year's Eve.  No.  For the 9PM fireworks, they had champagne (until it ran out) or soda, glow sticks and sparklers.  Same for the midnight fireworks.  The roof is not handicapped accessible.  And, they would not allow tripods for cameras. We had to have a letter authorizing us to be on the roof, and had to go to the desk to get that.  Not a big deal, but for so much money, why not put the letter along with some 2019 glasses, hats, maybe noise makers, on each bed?  Thousands paid for a place to stand and watch 30 minutes of fireworks. While the view was excellent, a two night minimum at that price would have been reasonable.  We could have done a luxury hotel and boat in the harbour for the same or less money. Then there was the service.  One of the desk clerks was flat out rude.  Another couldn't answer a question about where to get coffee.  Our friends were two days without toilet paper in their room, though they repeatedly asked. We asked for additional towels that never came.  No coffee maker, just instant packets.  No room service other than what you could get yourself for 1/2 the price for breakfast across the street (yes, that's where they get their room service food.) And, after all that, we had taken 2 waters from the fridge before seeing the listing that said they were $5 each, and they billed us for those.  And, lastly, considering they're catering to so many foreign clients, their bill does not state whether the prices are in AUD.  I would not go back. This is a budget hotel charging luxury hotel pricing for NYE.  It's obvious they know they'll fill the hotel without repeat business, putting customer service as a low priority.",1

Breakfast buffet very good but pricey at $30. So get it in ur package. Rooms nice and very clean but see caution below. Landscaping very nice. Massage chairs in lounge. Bad-the smaller double is Euro small and only has a double bed. Larger has queen and is quiet nice but pricey. When everything tallied, not a good deal.  Laundry but people camp out so seldom available. Ugly-decent Kaisaiki but over priced. Better quality available in numerous places.  So, not bad, but can do better.",1

46540,"My wife and I were boarding a ship at the International Cruise Terminal at Circular quay, so we went down to Sydney a day early so there would be no complications. As we were only there overnight, I chose the cheaper, budget double. The location of the inn is perfect for people staying overnight for a cruise ship.   We landed at the Domestic Airport and caught the train directly to Museum Station.  The station entrance is only meters from the Hyde Park Inn.  To go to the ship, just walk back to Museum Station and catch the train to Circular Quay. Check-in was fast and friendly, though we were not told that we needed to tap a sensor in the lift to be allowed to reach the upper floors.  Fortunately, there was an employee in the lift who showed us what to do. The biggest shock was, no window in the room.  We have only experienced a room like that in China.   The room was small but adequate for a short stay and the shower was excellent.  Beds were comfortable and the newspaper was complimentary each morning. Had a wander around Hyde Park and then a little of the city, and found that Liverpool Street was the dinner destination. I was torn on the ranking of the Hyde Park Inn, after all, I had a budget room, but maybe I would give it 3 and a half stars if I could, but not 4 stars.",1

Not sure if it's just those on the first floor and not sure where the noise is from, but it keeps me up at night.  I also can't get the thermostat to warm up. It seems to only kick out cold air. I also prefer to have a fridge in the room.   The only benefits are the location and bakery on the main floor.   ",1
37309,The hotel is near the centeal station and a good place to start your city tours. The staff is not unfriendly but a greeting when coming or leaving the hotel would feel better.

22502,"I booked this hotel because of the Sleep, Park, Fly feature. I'm from Waco and had an early morning international flight.   I requested the 4 a.m. shuttle the night before as is requested by the hotel, despite having everything squared away I woke up the next morning and was told the shuttle wasn't running that morning and that I'd be reimbursed for an Uber. The Uber ended up being $12 and some change -- the clerk offer me $12 -- which is no big deal, but I have a feeling that would not be acceptable if our roles were reversed. I ended up leaving around 4:15/20 -- not too far off schedule, but sometimes that slight difference does make an impact -- next time I will come down earlier just in case it happens again. Upon my return, I called for a pick-up and it was quick and easy -- no problems.  It was conveniently located close to the airport. The room was fine, but average. Water pressure was lacking in the rooms, but could be fixed easily. I would book again because its the only Sleep, Park, Fly hotel near the Austin airport.",1

The room was fully outfitted with a coffee maker, a jug of water, etc.  We were on the second floor so were able to sleep with the windows open - that along with a tower fan made the room very comfortable.  Our room was right by the busy, noisy street, but it didn't bother us.  They do offer earplugs.  The room is clean and they had quite a nice continental breakfast.  We slept well though the mattress was not very comfortable.  The only downside for us was the parking.  It is only 5 blocks away so I guess that's not so bad.  This is a nice place with very friendly staff.",1

As for the rooms and general areas, they are very spacious and comfortable. The gym is well equipped. Food is at best average. The English of the staff is really insufficient for an international 5 star hotel. You may expect the head waiter to speak reasonable English.  Cleaning could be better. Again my top level shelf was full of dust. My shirts did not get dirty as i was warned by my previous visit! As last time, the shampoo and other items had their expiry date from mid 2014.   So the issues I experienced last time seem to be not an exception. Will probably look for an alternative next time.",1

14374,This hotel is extremely large and is really a convention hotel.

20253,"ok, i'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Arrived and thought, oh god, this can't be right - we pulled up outside a random, almost disused building which wasn't very aesthetically pleasing. Walked in and was greeted by a extremely nice, well mannered enthusiastic host who filled us with relief.  So, basically the owners seems to be buying floors or whatever of this old style hotel and then completely transforming them into very modern, clean, stylish rooms. They have 3 floors all finished to a very high standard. The owners are great, very helpful, speak brilliant english, are available and at reception from 7 till 7, just brill. Make it so you can get straight into your holiday.  We stayed in room 15 i think, Caesar. Twin sink bathroom, walk in shower, real modern decor, sofa bed, wardrobe, king size bed in the adjoining room, balcony, TV, fridge - you name it. The hall of each floor is well lit, clean, warm with a communal computer for web access - and of course there is free wifi.  Breakfast is your standard continental - the staff always offer you fresh coffee and keep refilling. Nothing is too much trouble.  Ok, Rome itself. The place has been ruined by migrants. every tourist attraction has groups of them - if not trying to sell you a selfie stick, trying to sell you tickets to beat the queues for something you don't have to cue for. They get up in your face and start shouting at you in the street.   Do not buy anything from the street traders - find the souvenir shops and mini markets, around 1/10th of the price for some things.  The traffic is mental - if you don't have your wits about you, you will be killed. red lights and crossings mean nothing, everyone uses their phone even on motorbike, the road markings are ignored, its an absolute free for all.  The buses are the best way to get about but the signage is awful. it will take you a while to figure out and you will get lost - they are cheap however and regular.   Food everywhere is just pizza pasta and tomato sauce - but I have to say our italian restaurants are much nice. Find the right place though and you can pay 3.50 for 1/2 litre of red wine! Beer is expensive and McDonalds is a god send, low prices and reliable food.   Architecture is stunning, history is breathe taking. When we went however, the spanish steps were closed and the privy fountain or whatever was switched off with scaffold around.  It rained all day saturday and the streets can't handle it, you end you walking in a puddle everywhere you go.  Top top tip - don;t go for the weekend only, we went Thursday to Sunday. Luckily did the vatican city and st peters church thing on the very first day - didn't queue for anything and walked around very easily. saturday we walked past the same places - 3 hr queues and absolutely crowed with people - could definitely spoil the weekend.  Rome is a must but is certainly not the place we imagined it to be - can't make a romantic weekend of it but will certainly be taken back by the history of the place.  The Star of Rome certainly gave us somewhere to go which felt very comfortable and allowed you to relax and catch your breathe. Very clean and modern - a true hidden gem.  Oh, room has air con and make sure the ladies are covered up when visiting places with picture of Jesus in. shoulders cannot be on show, boobs mustn't be either, lads can't wear shorts etc.",1
10855,"If you’re looking for a luxury Sydney hotel please do look elsewhere. I paid 1500 AUD per night for a top level suite. The room was shabby with badly scratched furniture, ripped wallpaper, bit’s missing off the doors and loose shelves.  The service was also poor. At 3.30pm my room still had not been serviced and only then when I complained. Upon check in I was not offered the Club lounge access, I had to ask for it. The Receptionist was confused whether it was included or not and it was only on pointing out that I had a suite was it given.  The hotel does have some good points. Great location, a good breakfast and Club 32 is superb. However this is by no means a luxury hotel and as there are so many different hotels to choose from in Sydney I would recommend doing some research rather than trusting the Four Seasons brand.",1
42729,"1st night of a 3-nights stay at Movenpick Sousse at USD 220 per night.  I'd like to clarify that this review is not against the employees at Movenpick Sousse hotel who are trying to help as much as they can. It is more about sharing facts and suggestions so that the upper management of Movenpick takes actions to fix the below issues that are definitely not expected from a 5-star hotel  1. Incorrect and misleading information about complimentary transportation from airport to hotel: The hotel claim to offer a complimentary (FREE) transportation from airport to hotel turned to be incorrect and misleading. The hotel offered us instead a round trip transportation at USD 150 between Tunis Carthage airport and Movenpick Sousse.   Suggestion: Update the website web page content by removing the mention of complimentary transportation.   2. Unnecessary and long re-checkin despite confirmation  of online checkin: I checked online on time and got email confirmation. I was instructed to simply present my registration number to get room key at the hotel lobby. Instead, I waited for 45 minutes with my wife and kids. We had checkin in person for the two rooms again!! Suggestion: Fix your online checkin process if broken or train/retrain your employees to access related checkin information online if your online check is not broken.   3. One of the rooms supposed to be a partial sea view one is facing a trash dump! The room is USD 220 per night! This is a health related issue! We don't know what type of mosquito bite we can get if we dare getting out in the balcony. Please see attached picture. Many requests to different layers of management to change our room were unsuccessful. Reason given: All 608 hotel rooms are taken despite seeing many people still checking in!!  Suggestion: Work with authorities to remove the trash dump and clean the area. Until, then better make the room unavailable",1
31765,"Room: 1/5 The classic rooms are located In the basement, there are 2 levels of the basement, all of which have a strong smell of drains and sewage. In my room particularly, whenever someone above you flushes the toilet the pipes are very loud and sounds louder than an aeroplane toilet and hatch above shower leaks brown liquid into the shower which releases a ghastly odour. Lots on stains on shelves, mirrors and tables. Other rooms have massive pillars in the room making access to half the room difficult. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: the two basement levels have so called “outside space” which is actually a closed off greenhouse in which there is a staircase where others people can access your room if the door is open and also see you if your curtains are open. MAJOR ISSUE.   Facilities: 2/5 Wifi is ok for a hotel, speeds of up to 4-6mb/s  Pool is not heated, electronic sign stated 3°-4° Celsius every day I was there.  Sauna and steam room free, everything else there is a charge.  Often see dogs in the entrance.  Beware room service is charged in € and not the local currency.   Service: 0.5/5 The service by the reception staff was horrendous. Asked for 2 joining rooms when booking, requested was ignored. Complained about the smell, ignored. My room had a broken chair which took 3 days to replace with another dirty chair. Ripped slippers provided. They will lie and tell you want to want to hear and pass you to the next person. Notably Guest Relations CÜNEYT would pretend his phone doesn’t make calls, and then dial a number and play us a message in Turkish, if he knows this why is he putting on a show? That’s the type of service you will get at this hotel.  Waiters, bell boys and cleaners were as expected.   Location: 4/5 Good location, in walking distance to most of the sights and the tram. Taxi’s do not like coming here from the airport, will charge 700-800 Lira from SAW airport. One way road, taxi’s dislike. Hotel will tell you prices of taxis which are not accurate if you have to go on the highway due to tolls. Restaurants right opposite the hotel are extortionate for tourists, they will drag you in there. Avoid! Or check the menu thoroughly.   Breakfast: 3/5 Not what you would expect from an alleged “5 Star Hotel”, maybe a 3 star hotel quality. Only positive was the service from the waiter KADER was brilliant.",1
423,"Booked to stay 24-27th August 2022 as part of our road trip around Italy. The Starhotels echo was the last of six hotels we stayed in over the two weeks of travelling.   To keep things short, here’s the good, bad and ugly.   Good: 1. Excellent bedrooms, in near new condition with very modern designed bathrooms  2. Very comfortable bed and pillows. The best of all hotels we stayed in during our trip to Italy  3. Location next to Centrale Railway Station and Metro - very easy therefore to get round the city   Bad: 1. No complimentary drinking water in room  2. Very poor sanitary kits - no hair conditioner, cotton pads, liquid soap next to wash hand basin was empty and never refilled  3. Slippery bath tub to take shower … and no rain shower for a design that it really should have it   Ugly: 1. Breakfast was awful, very limited and what was on offer was of very poor quality. For example the  cold cuts tray on Friday 26th Aug morning smelt off when opening the plastic lid. I nearly threw up with the foul smell. The meat isn’t kept chilled so it’s not surprising it was rotting away 2 hrs into breakfast (around 9am). Also, the bacon, roasted vegetables and scrambled eggs (only items that are supposed to be hot food) was cold and tasteless.  2. Service at breakfast was non existent. I counted only 2-3 staff working for a hotel that looked fully occupied. For example our dirty plates weren’t cleared from table even though we’d moved to having a 2nd set of food from the fruits table. This wasn’t just in one occasion but on both mornings.  3. There is no onsite parking and the hotel offers 24 hour valet service but at €30 per day! Ouch.   This was my 2nd time staying at the hotel, the last being in late 2018. I came back expecting to be thrilled like I was back then but sadly the awful breakfast has left a very bitter taste and won’t be back until I read reviews that breakfast is back to a level that a 4* hotel should offer.   My recommendation is book of you’re just looking for accommodation because IT IS GOOD … as there are plenty of places close to the hotel that you can go have a cheaper and much better breakfast.",1
25218,"I am a Gold IHG member for about 13-14 years now and I have reserved and stayed in IHG member hotels all over the world and the United States.  For the most part, reservations have been uneventful.  I get an email with a confirmation number and I show up at the hotel and my room is ready.   Not with Holiday Inn Singapore Katong.  Let me be clear.  This is the first review I have ever written about a hotel that I have never set foot on but I think reservations is the threshold of any hotel.     I reserved a room at this hotel a few days ago for a 6 night stay in the middle of January next year and today I got a short email from the hotel itself (Which I found very irregular) saying that my credit card transaction was incomplete and i f I don't reply by email with another credit card number in 24 hours, they will not only cancel my reservations but also keep my deposit.   How puzzling.    First:   I have a confirmation email from IHG with a confirmation number.   Does that not guarantee that I do have a room reserved at that hotel?  Second:   How can they take my deposit if they cannot charge my credit card?   Third:  I don't think it is safe to transmit my credit card particulars by email.  I have never done that and will never do that.     Like I said earlier, I really like making reservations with IHG, but this email from this particular hotel has left me with doubts about the security and safety of my credit card information in the days of data theft.  Not good, IHG.  Not good at all.",1
29692,"Has been a favourite in Singapore for many years. Unfortunately this visit may be our last.. Most important, no longer free shuttle to and from airport.. only taxi. The great Executive lounge on 17  is now only coffee, tea, & Coke. 11am-7pm.  (on the dot) Breakfast & dreary evening canapes    + two (only) drinks per person in one corner of restaurant. No service from staff at breakfast lots of  crashing & banging, food was not refilled. Rooms clean but shabby. Interconnect door covered with foam. Bath shower feels a bit slippery.  Good points.. Great pool.  Really efficient  lifts.  Good air-conditioning. Outdoor local food court 5 mins walk, wonderful choices, great value. Shopping Mall close by Marks & Spencer, Starbucks, Maccas + lots of clothes shops. Whole hotel feels unloved and a bit sad. Think it needs some new love.  ",1
51427,"Decent location - easy access to metro and buses. Hostess is great, very helpful. Breakfast is decent, cereal croissant toast juice etc. Internet is very poor to non existent inside the room. She said its because of the iron door she is using, so it becomes like a faraday cage. We had to keep the door open to get some internet. But the connection kept dropping again and again, frustrating everyone. A/C is a small indoor room kind, low power, unable to cool the room at all. All other B&B's have split A/C but not this one. She said her association doesn't allow. We had tough time sleeping on hot nights.",1
1138,"Nice hotel with very helpful and friendly staff. We were given complementary welcome drink and a talk of things to see and do, which was a nice touch. Has a spa/sauna which we used. Breakfast was the usual affair (yes they have hot dog sausages lol). There are some restaurants, (Burgers/Pizza etc) , couple of bars within walking distance and a Tesco express, also pharmacy nearby. Tram stop is next road over and you are around 25min walk to Charles Bridge, Castle and Old Town. Recommend getting around by tram and you can get daily tickets from Tobacconist nearby (or pay by card onboard). It was our wedding anniversary and the maid had written a lovely note & left chocolates which was sweet. All in all we would totally recommend the Julian hotel for your stay. If you book direct they also offer discount 😀 ❤️PRAHA",1
34220,"First of all, I quite like Fairmont as a chain. They usually go the extra mile compared to a lot of other chains, whether it's on the design, the service, or just generally the small details.  And that's exactly why I have to give this one a 4 instead of a 5.  Because the devil is in the details.  And while this may not affect you as a traveler, I actually hope that the management of the hotel reads this, and understands what needs to be done.     Let me start off by saying that, too often, I read reviews on TripAdvisor that are just nitpicky and self-centered. Always have your expectations in check, and if you have a specific issue during your stay, talk to the staff and managers, don't air it out on here. So yes, I will be digging into details, but I'll be trying to do so as objectively as possible.  Therefore for this one I'll just be going with a list of pros and cons, to make it easier for everyone. Because I can say it right away, YES, this is easily one of the best hotels in Nanjing. But there are some issues.   Pros:  - Fantastic building design, both outdoors and indoors. Stunning.  Fantastic work by SOM. - Hallways and rooms are quiet, cozy, and give you a great sense of privacy.  - Concierge is very helpful for booking transportation  (in our case, we usually stay at this hotel for business in the software park, therefore it's quite close. If you wanna be closer to the city center, it's another story). - Breakfast is phenomenal, with a huge selection every day, on the 67th floor, overlooking the city. - Lighting in the room is easily controllable, and gives you a lot of options to adjust it to your exact mood. - TV built-in to the bathroom mirror means you don't miss a minute of the action (the 2018 World Cup in my case!) - Very interesting room design with the ""bedroom"" area on one side and the ""bathroom area"" on the other, almost in equal size. - Good selection of TV channels and movies (for free). - ""Vancouver Grill"" restaurant is stunning in design, service, and food quality. I don't know Nanjing enough, but I wouldn't hesitate to say this is probably the best steakhouse in the city.   Now, for the CONS.  And they are SMALL ones. I need to emphasize that.  But they are issues that can easily degenerate quickly, if not attended to, especially considering this hotel is only a handful of years old:  - Electric plugs on the well-thought out ""multimedia port"" were completely destroyed. - Bed right side control panel came off while unplugging a device. - Ceiling ""wood covers"" peeling off. - Service in English can be so-so off-peak hours - Apparently complete ignorance of what Fairmont status entails at check-in  (may be related to the merger with Club Accor one week later).   These are small details, that make the difference between 4 and 5 stars.  And having lived in China for a decade now, I know that if you let your building go, it will deteriorate FAST.  So I really hope that the management understands that, and can do something about it, for their own good, really.  Fairmont's brand is all about details, and you'd want to live up to it.  I'm attaching some pictures to show both the pros and cons. Again, the cons are by no means deal-breakers. But I want to highlight them because if they're not addressed, this property could deteriorate way faster than it should, and I've seen too many such sad stories in China.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy your stay at that great hotel!",1
21795,"We have visited South Korea for 14 days for the first times and we have changes 3 hotel totally and this hotel is the worst amongst,  maybe the worst amongst the previous.  Check in: We reach hotel around 1pm with 2 kids and 4 big luggage. It's on weekday cant check in first. Need wait till 3pm. Ok we drop the luggage and went out around. One day waste for waiting hotel room. Ok, ask for higher floor with best view, asked me sign a letter declaration no smoking in the hotel and room if not fined 200,000 won. Check in the room not facing the requested directions and view, and the whole room full of smoking smell. Hey , are u kidding with me. Just asked me signed said this is very serious ur hotel no smoking and fined me but u give me a family a smoking room. Without hesitation I take the 4 big luggage go down and asked for room change immediately. On second day of stayed, we asked for extension till 6pm on our last day which is another 3 days staying caused our flight on midnight not good bring kids waiting outside. Say will reply us tomorrow. I told them we normally will granted by other hotels during our travelled for charging us half day rate which is fair, but no reply until on last day of staying we went there ask again only very reluctant told cant until 6pm even we pay half day. He only allow us stayed until 1pm. On last day of staying when we busz packed our luggage they called on 1230pm asked why we didn't check out yet. What's a funny front desk.  In room: Shower room is transparent and can see clearly during bath. So if u coming with family not recommend. One day when we back to hotel around 9pm we discovered the window almost fall down the front desk come up and felt worry also but no maintenance ady. She asked us stayed in another room tomorrow stay back again the same room. We found very weird lo. Why not just change the room for another 2 night stay and want stay one night there one night here.  Is it easier to change the room so easy? We suggested if really cant solved the issues just change us to new room even we are very tired changing room but we dont know what will happened to the windows as current weather are very windly and cold.   Housekeeping:  After 2 days stayed we ask to clean the room. As after we come back the windows become like fall down. Ok at the end u come to explained back to us after 30 minutes that's yr design but its unacceptable u as staff u not replied in prompt that's yr design only come back after 30 minutes u and we worried?. Ok housekeeping didn't change all the toiletries,  no refill water, the rubbish not throw out lo, only windows they have touched as I remembered I have open a bit and u closed all.   Checking out: As mentioned they not allowed for extension till 6pm for half day charge. After we check out we go out walk and shop. Back around 4pm ask for taxi, no helper at all they said demonstrating are on the street. Ask us push the big 4 luggage to the street try to get the taxi.   Amenities: No coffee inside the room too.   Location: 8-10 minutes walk to city hall line 2. Near namdameun and quite far from myeongdong around 15-20 minutes walk. Surrounding got e mart 24 hours, 7-11 and cu. Restaurant not many.   Conclusion would not recommend to anyone of u as they are so many choices around! O ya, on my last day staying I want to celebrate my wife birthday by just sign a song with birthday cake, I go down and told them my wife is birthday can lend me a lighter they told not available ask me go to emart buy. From all these u can see how they attain to the guest and so bad their service attitude! Very unhappy stayed!",1
64008,"We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel rooms and facilities in general  look quite dated and require refurbishment.   Hotel concierge is not attentive. They told us that some places are 5 minute walking distance, which turned up to be a walk of 20-25 minutes uphill with lots of stairs. For other inquiries for boats to the islands, they asked us to google them. It is not what you would expect from an upscale hotel!",1
2927,"This hotel was suggested to us by ETS and we told them that we wanted to go to a hotel as we went on our honeymoon. I have not seen any hotel like this before because there is nothing to do. No children animations, no adult animations, no activity that you can do. We asked ETS and the hotel, ""We want to go there but in this season you can close some activities and we want to be sure that you can still continue the summer season"" then they said, ""Yes, we still continued the summer season and we did not pass the winter season yet"". According to their answer, we booked the hotel but we could not do anything because almost everywhere was closed. If you do not supply decent activities or animations, etc so do not accept bookings, OK? People do not earn their money to throw into a garbage. The staff was very uninterest, there were many flies and cats at the food court even one of the cats pooped at the food court. There is one place children can play and also the staff is uninterest. Almost every staff was morose. I can not understand why you are working in such a hotel If you will be morose. The biggest issue that we faced was that my wife got sick. Last day of our holiday, my wife got fever before leaving the hotel. We had to go hospital on our home way because she has fever of 39.7 Celcius. The doctor said she got an infection. I think she got that from the pool or food because only two things were that you can do in the hotel. I absolutely do not recommend this hotel, If you want to go there think ten times at least.",1
39702,"I came to Seoul for my birthday together with my 5yo. This is our first time in Seoul, and also her first time travelling in winter. I chose this hotel because we had a great experience at Solaria Bangkok. However this hotel is a let-down. From location to room-size to the STAFF. While the staff at Solaria Asok were welcoming and kind, the staff at Solaria Myeongdong were rude and unkind. My girl was exhausted from yesterday’s long walks and movie which ended late (there was only ONE screening of 4dx Ant-Man at 8:30pm, which ended close to 11pm). By the time we got back to the hotel and washed up, it was past midnight. Today we both got up late, especially her, couldn’t get her out of bed. But barely 10mins after she’s up and  we got calls from reception urging us to check-out. At 12:15pm, I was told to check out by 12:30pm or pay extra. I told them my situation and said I’m doing my best to get ready and leave. At 12:30pm, I got another call and I had to beg for an extra 10mins (to finish packing). The lady who called said ok, if I’m not checked out by 12:40pm, I have to pay 22,000krw per hour. It was a very stressful stay, is all I can stay. (And hopefully, I didn’t leave anything behind in my rush to get out of the room.) Having worked in hotels myself, and coming from a hospitality background, this is truly disappointing. Go elsewhere if you have young kids and/or big heavy luggage (quite far from the metro and some parts are stairs-only… we were lucky strangers helped us with the luggage)",1

45480,"As a business/event partner/venue, Ritz Carlton has never disappointed given the top notch event organization capacity, service standard, professionalism, amd of course location itself is a big plus as well.   But as for individual guests, I have to say this time the experience is a bit underwhelming as my third time here.  First of all, the hotel needs a renovation. The rooms and facilities are old. Not the old-charm heritage type of old, but worn out. Service has also become average. It doesn't feel like Ritz Carlton, although the brand has done all it can to undermine that Marriott ownership, which I don't blame them. But it hasn't really delivered the traditional Ritz standard either. More English training is needed for front desk and concierge staff, otherwise this feels like a local chain. The housekeepers need to be more detail-oriented (i thought we are in Japan, excuse me?) to avoid constantly putting back empty toilet amenities without replacing them, or to do better in the night service.   Again, if this was for a normal hotel, I wouldn't have ranked four star. But it still carries the Ritz Carlton name, I would assume and expect higher standard. The only standard it never seems to miss is pricing.  To be honest, I wonder how this type of old-school so called luxurious hotels stay competitive in an environment that people's travel behavior has fundamentally changed. Anyway, not my problem. ",1

36917,"Overall, the stay at the Courtyard by Marriott in Al Barsha was ok. We stayed for 10 nights at the beginning of April 2023. The location is within walking distance of the Mall of the Emirates and a short drive from many attractions in Dubai. The bed was very comfortable and the pool on the rooftop was a nice place to spend the afternoon as it received a lot of sun throughout the day. Unfortunately, the same playlist of about 10 songs was on repeat during our entire stay -- which got a little bit annoying after a while.   There were a few notable issues during our stay that need to be addressed.   1) We could hear a lot of noises through the walls -- people speaking next door, guests passing by in the hallways, and the ""ding"" sound every time the elevator reached a floor.   2) The bass from the Oak Bar on the ground floor could be heard/felt all night (almost every night) in our room on the 5th floor. We informed the reception desk that we were disturbed by this and the response was, ""It only lasts until 3 am"".  This was not acceptable for us since we paid to sleep at the hotel and not go to a club.  3) The housekeeping services were severely lacking. We did not ask to have our room cleaned every day, but when we did there were times when the room was not cleaned after we were out all day and we had put the ""request housekeeping services"" light on before we left the room in the morning. Towels missing after every time they cleaned, (specifically no hand towel or floor mat/towel), and shampoo and body soap were not refilled. One time, there was a dirty cleaning towel from the housekeeping staff forgotten in our room.   4) In general, the room felt a bit tired and old as there were cracks in the tiles and coffee table, rust on the soap dispensers, stains on the chairs, the weighing scale was not functioning, and in some places, mold could be found around the edges of the walls. Humidity within the room was definitely an issue and not one that could be fixed by constantly blasting the AC.   This was actually our second time staying at the Courtyard by Marriott in Al Barsha and it feels like the overall standard has dropped. The hotel is rated as 4 stars, but given the numerous issues that we had, it felt more comparable to some 3-star hotels we have stayed at in Dubai.   ",1
16242,"Stayed for 5 night with my family, our room was filthy. Our  room was never cleaned in those 5 nights, even though we’d requested several times￼. No clean towels, phone didn’t work ,  no bedding on the beds , tap was broken, paint falling off the roof , and the hair dryer falling off the wall . We had to wash the bathroom out before we could use it . That was the upgrade room the first room they gave us was so bad that I wouldn’t even put my dog in . The manager was in the office speaking to 2 young woman , but wouldn’t come and speak to us . The front desk staff is so used to complaints that they aren’t even bothered , they just make excuses that the manager isn’t around when he’s just hiding out . They also charge for amenities every night , but WHAT AMENITIES?? The restaurant is hardly ever open but that’s probably a good thing. The pool is so dirty not one person used it while we was there .  Even the air conditioning was broken. Please stay away from it don’t ruin your holiday!!!",1
35767,"So, here's the issue:  I have a cane and they ""instinctively"" placed me in a handicapped room. I didn't ask for an accessible room. I never saw one thing on Hotel Tonight telling me I'd get one. But of ALL of the rooms available at 3 pm, the ONLY one was a handicapped room....first time in my Hotel Tonight experience (and I'm a Perk Level 15).   Once settled in this room, it was simply too challenging with the trucks below and the baby in the adjoining room....and they said that they were ""sold out tonight and no other rooms are available.""    Of course they weren't, especially after the visual bias I experienced by check in.  As for this room: **3 lights didn't work on the wall. **The noise in the alley (where this room faced, abutting an unoccupied run-down building) was ridiculous from trucks backing in....two at 11 pm! **The ONLY shade in the room and on the window was broken, with a snapped pulley  And so:  As I consider whether I'm posting this to ADA-related websites and social media platforms, don't let this place fool you.

My parents who were traveling with us are in their late 70s and early 80s, one with a recent hip replacement, the other with shoulder issues. The other two of us aren't young either.  Breakfast was in the building with reception.  And a few days there were waits to get seating for breakfast.  Most mornings, we either waited for seats or were guilted into hurrying our breakfast to make room for others. But we got extra towels when we asked and the rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. The ladies at reception connected us to a car service for rides from and to the airport.",1
62895,"One would think we wouldn't have to choose between a nice lobby and a clean, functional room when staying at a luxury hotel. That was the case for us at Corinthia, and this hotel was our biggest disappointment with our lodgings on this trip.  Make no mistake, the lobby and other common areas are outstanding. The staff are courteous. But the rooms, with the mold on the wall, stains on the couch, and no air conditioning are a disgrace for a place of this caliber.   Our room temperature was between 23 degrees and 24 degrees the entire stay. We had a technician service our air conditioning the first day we arrived and although assuring us that it would cool down, did not. Other customers were also complaining about the temperature upon our check in.   The Manager offered to move us to a different room and said he personally checked a few of them, and this one was the coolest. Upon checking it, it was 23.5 degrees and we just decided to stay put. Clearly, they should not be advertising this hotel as having air conditioning. I cannot even imagine what the temperature might be during the summer.  The included breakfast and access to the Executive Lounge were both excellent. We are inclined to avoid Corinthia Hotels in the future based on this experience.",1

21443,"Our first stay at the Stewart started poorly but Bernard saved the visit.  When we arrived there were several deficiencies, the blind fell off in my hand, the television didn’t work, there was no phone in the room and even though there is a “kitchen” there was nothing in there but on fry pan.  No cutlery, plates, glasses - nothing! A maintenance employee responded and he was fantastic!  His name is Bernard and he went above and beyond to make things right for us.  Is the Stewart wants to teach customer service they should have Bernard in charge! I might stay again because the location is great, but it is a very tired old property and needs a lot of TLC.  As an example, when using the toilet in room 1427 you are facing the washroom door.  It was filthy, covered in old dirt and coffee stains.  That stays with a visitor because it is what you see every time.  Maybe not a task for housekeeping, but, maintenance should have “task force” that deep cleans these rooms on a rotational basis.  For $400.00 a night guests deserve cleanliness.",1

I regret making the effort to stay here while trying to have a nice weekend with my partner. All inside dining options are first come, first serve (no reservations for parties of 2). You would hope a hotel restaurant would take care of its guests, but you'd be wrong. We were not seated for dinner at 5:30pm (2.5hr+ minumum wait for a 2 person table). We were not seated  at all for breakfast @10:20am. Our only options were the breakfast bar to place a to-go order or go back to our room for service. Being already dressed and inside the dining hall, we chose the ""to-go"" bar.

43342,"On this occasion, I have taken extra care to write a candid, truthful and complete review of my stay in fairness to this hotel.  I see the struggle between good and evil play out in this hotel: they have some great people on staff and some hostile people.  I prefer the hotels along Castle Peak Road over the tiny rooms in the noisy, busy shopping districts. This hotel is in a quiet location and the view from some of the rooms is great.  I set up a corporate account with the Royal View Hotel. This was my first visit to this hotel for 12 nights.  Usually I stay two weeks or more in Hong Kong.  My stay didn't start right.  I got a room that was not nice.  I got more comfortable due to the kindness of one Team member. More about that later.  Unfortunately I left the hotel ANGRY half way through my reservation.   The hotel public areas are clean.  The rooms are not clean (please see the photos).  My room door had a hidden but faulty hydraulic door closer and each time I forgot to slowly close the door, the neighbors experienced a rude awakening measuring about 7.9 on the richter scale. They fixed that after I left my initial review on TripAdviser.  The short young man that brought me the bottled water was really rash and hostile when he asked me to check the door closer and how well it now worked after it had been repaired.  Obviously he was unhappy I had pointed that out.  The staff are mostly friendly but two people stood out from all the rest:  1- Mr. Gary Fong is a hospitality industry star. He understands guest needs and is personally committed to make guests happy.  I was given a room with a large stain on the carpet. I pulled the lounge chair over it to cover the stain and in doing so I blocked my ocean view. Mr. Fong personally came up to my room, examined the stain, touched it to make sure the stain isn't recent (good management thinking) and offered me another room.  I really didn't want to inconvenience the hotel but he insisted that I must be happy in my room. I moved and I was happy with the new room.  I was grateful to him.  2-  Mr. Ray Ng, is the Assistant Director of Sales (Corporate).  He is a very professional Manager.  He gave me excellent service at time of booking the room.  I had another very positive interaction with him at time of check out in my moment of anger (I will explain later).    I had at time of check in nagged about the housekeeping service being twice a week but accepted that it was my fault for not reading the offer fully.  I respectfully suggested that corporate guests should get daily housekeeping service but the linen need not be changed daily.  When I published my first review on TripAdviser, a gentleman by the name of Eric called me to say that I would get daily room clean.  I thanked him and declined that kind offer because it was not fair to the hotel.  I had agreed to twice a week of cleaning service.  I suggested instead that I would just get twice a week service (which was to be Mondays and Thursdays) unless I left a Clean My Room sign outside for an extra day of cleaning.  Eric agreed to that.  The next day someone else called to say Eric was wrong to offer daily cleaning and they'd only clean twice a week.  OK ...I went along.  Eric kindly offered to replace the used Bottled waters daily.  Given that the hotel is far from shops, it's unreasonable to expect guests to buy Bottled water and carry it.  I was grateful with that arrangement.  I informed them that by around 10:30 I would be out of my room.  This was done everyday.  Thank you.  Let me point out: I keep my hotel room clean, wherever I stay. I worked in hotel industry for 11 years and I know how to make my bed professionally.  I usually never use or take the hotel amenities (soap, shampoo, tooth brush, slippers etc).  To clean a stay over room (Guest not checking out yet) takes about 15-20 minutes.  I estimate it would take five to eight minutes to clean the rooms I occupy.  I take out my own trash.  I wipe the surfaces clean.  I just need a change of bed sheets and one bath towel on the floor.   On my first night of stay (tired from a long intercontinental flight) I got a loud knock on my door at 2:30 am.  It was some obnoxious lady that mistakenly knocked on my room and she went to the next room.  From then on I would hang the Do Not Disturb sign until I leave for work the next morning.  Despite the Do Not Disturb sign, I would get a knock on my door each day around 10 am (or sometimes a phone call first) asking me to open the door and they'd kindly hand me bottled water.  I did not mind that.  I gave a tip on most days to the housekeeping staff who brought that water (except to the angry short young man).  Thursday came and Housekeeping Department called to say they'd clean my room on Friday instead.  Not a big issue, I agreed.  On Friday my room was cleaned.  Everyday that the maid service would be in, I left a tip on the bed.  This is  more equitable way of thanking the people who take care of you, rather than leaving a large tip at the very end of your stay for one lucky person.    By Monday my bed sheet really needed a change as I had perspired a lot and my towels were all used up.  I had showered a few times a day in that hot weather.  I got a call from Housekeeping advising that they would not be cleaning the room on Monday.  I asked why?  They said they tried to clean my room on Saturday but there was a DND sign!  Since when did the DND sign matter?  And who ever decided the room would be cleaned on Saturdays?  It was to be Mondays and Thursdays.  No one ever told me about a change of date to Saturday!  The less-than-kind lady on the phone said there is only one way to get the room cleaned: pay for the cleaning service.  I was now upset.  I told her there was another solution: I was going to check out.  I do not need to argue with her.  So I packed my luggage and papers and went to lobby.  I was informed that they'd be charging me if I checked out after 11 am.  This was subsequently extended to noon.  In the lobby I began looking for another hotel.  Mr. Ray Ng kindly invited me to coffee and wanted to hear me out.  I asked him how many rooms does a housekeeper clean in one day?  He said around 25 (this is true in Asia.  In N America they are expected to clean 16-20 rooms).  I told him based on that figure the average cleaning service would cost the hotel less than US$1 per room.  What were they doing upsetting guests for something so cheap and basic?  He assured me that instructions had been sent to the Housekeeping department to clean my room daily and somehow they missed that instruction.   I politely told him no guest request for a room cleaning service should ever be declined, especially if you have a corporate guest staying 12 nights in what is purported to be a Four Star hotel.  I left that hotel half way.  That translated to a loss of about $600 of revenue for which he had worked hard, because some poorly trained  person in Housekeeping Department felt powerful refusing to clean the room and didn't care about upsetting the guest.  After all I was merely wanting to get my room cleaned on the days they had scheduled for me and promised.   I also told him their hotel was tired and in need of a major renovation.   The location is far from the city center.  So they must deliver excellent service if they want return guests.    Ray graciously treated me to coffee and apologized repeatedly.  I appreciate that care and attention and effort to turn an upset customer into a friend again.  I explained that I would not be back but I was not nearly as angry after meeting him.   So... there is a big disconnect between one manager and another.  And I think there is some attitude of let's stick it to the guest when we can.  I was told in writing for every seven days of stay I would get two laundry token/coins.  Great.  I used the laundry one night but ran into a problem: there is a big green button on the washing machine and a sign with poor English grammar asks you to press that button if you wish to have no Detergent.  I did not understand that notice and pressed the button thinking it is green and Detergent will flow.  One of the security staff of the hotel was in the laundry room and saw what happened and with poor command of English explained that he could not modify that selection.  I went downstairs and paid HK$22 to buy another token/coin.  Mr. Fong was on duty and offered to send someone to run the machine a second time with detergent.  I declined.  It was my mistake.  I asked Mr. Fong to replace the signs but I bought an extra token for HK$22 and went back up to the laundry.  I waited until the machine completed its cycle.  I put my new token inside and failed to get the machine restarted.  My token was gone.  I lost patience and brought my damp clothes to my room.  On my check out, I asked if I could return the extra laundry token/coin and the young lady at Front Counter gleefully reached out her arm to take my token as she explained there would be no refunds.      The shuttle service for this hotel is quite good.  Room sizes are comfortable, not congested.  There is no luggage support stand. They have a complete set of toiletries and towels in the bathroom.  A little store provides some basic stuff and pastries.   My room was on the 19th floor.  The elevator serves the 18th and 19th floor which basically means you have to walk up or down around a dozen steps to get to your floor after you exit the elevator.  For corporate guests, there must be some minimum amenities. For example a business center is a good thing with a couple terminals and a printer. This hotel has no business center and one would need to send the document to front desk for printing at cost of HK$5 per page. To me HK$5 for first page, then HK$1 for subsequent pages is reasonable. Also, there are times when confidentiality doesn't prefer the document to be handled by others. With a $1,000 investment, a quiet corner can be turned into a business center.  No business Center here.  That night I had one of our company directors arriving and I needed to book an extra room.  Instead I wasted a half a day of my time checking out, taking a taxi and checking into another hotel.  I wrote to Mr. Ng: “Tonight I have another guest arriving who needed a room.  I was about to call you but I will book him into another hotel where he will be treated with honesty and respect. I am not staying here again.”   I moved to another hotel in Tsuen Wan area and will return to that hotel on my next trip in three weeks time.",1
62566,"Read reviews first and chose this place based on the location to my business meeting but also the food reviews. The room was warm with a really noisy air conditioner. There are a lot of stairs - be warned!  The pub was actually dead (it was a Tuesday night but in the middle of a  residential area). Despite the quietness of the kitchen, our food was burnt and overcooked,  and disappointingly small for  the price.",1

We’ll try it tonight.,1
8427,"Cons You have to pay extra to watch TV, and I mean just to watch TV, nothing special,  never seen this option before.  This payment is Daily. You have to pay extra to use the pool, and being a family this charge can be even more expensive than the room itself.  I'm talking about week days, because during the weekends the price is even higher!!!! Of course breakfast is additional as well.  Is not a nice buffet,  just a continental option..  Closest metro station (Toyocho) is about 15 minutes walk, not a big deal unless is summer time...these 15 minutes were hell every day..  Pros The hotel is part of small mall/restaurants area, it means just taking the elevator takes you to a good supermarket, drugstore, bakery or restaurant, where you can actually have a good breakfast/meal.  Others The rooms are small, I had to take 2 rooms to accommodate my family The area (once in the metro) is fairly distanced from nice areas like skytree, ginza & shibuya. ",1
14433,"The RIHGA Royal Hotel is an upper-level hotel characterized by friendly service and its location on Nakanoshima (island) in central Osaka. The location is, well... complicated, for several reasons. It's not really close to anything of the note (besides the Convention Center), and although Nakanoshima station, a private rail line, is nearby, it's not the most useful public transportation in Osaka - certainly not as convenient as being close to the metro, which is about a 15-20 minute walk off of the island. If this type of thing doesn't matter for you, this is a better choice. The atmosphere does feel a little more like a business hotel, although I did see a fair amount of families. The neighborhood is prettier at night.   There is a handy free shuttle bus that makes the 20-25 minutes drive from JR Osaka Station to the hotel. You should save a map of the pick-up location, as JR Osaka Station is pretty expansive and could be confusing for a first-timer. Once I arrived, the friendly staff quickly greeted me; check-in went smoothly and I had no issues communicating with the front desk. There appeared to be many international guests in the modern, spacious lobby. There are a plethora of shops inside the complex, and they all looked expensive.   I found an online deal for my room, which I suspect contributed to it not being too large, but it was comfortable and clean nonetheless. The free wifi worked ok, and the TV wasn't very big, but acceptable. I had a double bed I believe, and I slept alright. The bathroom is the typical standard sized Japanese affair, which was good enough, and the amount of sink space wasn't bad. The housekeeping seemed fine, and the staff responded pretty quickly when I requested an ironing board and iron. Checking out on the last day went without a hitch. Overall, this is a good hotel; due to the location, next time I would probably stay at a hotel closer to the metro, but you could certainly do worse than this place.",1

59464,If you are looking for the Tokyo city experience this is not the place to go. The place is a good walking distance from a local train station and when you are towing roller bags at 9 pm it seems to be a long ways away. No local restaurants were around since you are in a residential area. Once we got train passes and station locations worked out it was a quiet relief from the active city sights. On our way back through Tokyo we stayed very close to the Tokyo train statino and that was a little better for us.,1
38462,"This hotel is terrible and in very bad shape.  Despite the Ibis being located adjacent to the airport, it was still a 30 min drive through some sketchy back alleys to get here.  The room was old and worn out.  The AC unit wasn't working and the overall layout of the property was crowded and in a constant state of disrepair.   I had a flight the next morning and I needed a place to stay overnight.  The Jarkata Airport Hotel was closed for renovations.  I normally stay there.  Avoid the Ibis Styles at all costs.  Anara is a newly opened hotel that is located in Terminal 3.  Stay there instead.  The free hotel shuttle was severely cramped and stuffy.  The AC unit wasn't working on the shuttle either.

21375,"Being a Centara Privilege member,  for which we paid 5000 baht, meant nothing to the hotel.  We had e-vouchers we could use for food and drinks and we were constantly denied this, to the point we got fed up and just signed room service bills for full amount.  I emailed the main Privilege club office to complain, and only then was this sorted.  By then,  it was too late,  we had lost faith and avoided eating and drinking at the hotel. Breakfast options, great, if you're a non-veg! However,  even for the non-veg, although plenty of options, it was the same options every day, which can get boring after a while!  We had tiny ants in our room that got into the snacks, which we had to bin.  They often got into the bed too and you would feel them bite you.  The hotel is old and dated.  I understand Phuket is still only just recovering after covid, but,  with a little care and maintenance, this could be a great hotel due to its prime location in Karon.",1
61998,"I stayed with my husband for 6 nights. I have stayed there many times before. The main advantage of this hotel is a bit of peace and sanity in the centre of Athens and a large outdoors pool. Two things that I always thought needed TLC: a/the carpets on the floors (ideally they would be replaced as they are old and stale and there is a smoke smell in some floors), b/the inside of the pool. As nice as the pool is , it needs painting as it’s always white and flaky inside. The main issue with our stay was a sense of reduced services attributed to Covid. In room dining arrives in plastic containers (almost like on a plane) and plastic glasses but a seabass main course still comes at 32 euros a head. We ordered a decaf coffee one evening and a plastic cup with hot water arrived and a sachet of coffee. We refused to pay for that which would have been free before if in room facilities were present in the room. The pool restaurant is also closed and food comes from another restaurant in the hotel. Laundry is not available over weekends. We were helped to the nearest launderette where we did our own washing. There were some computers at the lounge but the printer was not working so you had to send everything to the reception desk.  I don’t quite understand how they can’t serve food in proper plates and cups in the room when all restaurants are open in Athens and they don’t serve you in plastic containers.  The prices are the same but what you get is less for your money. A shame as I used to be a regular customer but I’ll think again next time.",1

6881,"If you're like me, you think a hostel is a somewhat dodgy place that you stay in when you're young and broke. When it comes to Mei Ho House, that could not be further from the truth. This hostel is a former public housing unit that underwent an extensive renovation to become it's current iteration. While there is the traditional hostel bunkbed dorm room, MHH also offers LARGE modernly furnished rooms with a private bath. Your stay also offers you a daily breakfast and access to a very well-curated museum that does an amazing job in conveying the history of public housing in HK, the realities of life in very small quarters and memories of the people who lived in there. The museum really is a gem because it serves as a reminder that HK wasn't always gleaming skyscrapers and wealth.   Other details: MHH is located in Sham Shui Po which is great neighborhood to be in. The MTR station is about a 5 min walk. There's tons of amazing, cheap traditional HK foods. And it's an interesting glimpse of a more working class neighborhood.   Final verdict: Nice hotels in HK are super expensive. Cheaper hotels or an Airbnb is likely to be crazy tiny. So do yourself a favor and stay at MHH.",1
43547,"Was there for a work trip. Like most four to five stars hotel, the room was big with a good view of the lake. However after the first night, I could feel that the room was relatively warm without ventilation. Made the comment to the hotel and I was told that the air con was pre-set and could not be adjusted. The hotel had to open the window of the room for me the next day. The most disappointing incident was that I have sent my clothes for laundry service and found that my clothes were ironed but not washed. It took almost 30 min of explanation to the hotel manager who finally agreed to refund the charges made for the laundry. Need improvement in the service.",1
27297,"I’ve stayed in a few all inclusive resorts in the Cancún/Riviera Maya area and I believe this resort falls very short of basic expectations.  The overarching theme of the experience felt very pressured - it began with a campaign by the check in staff to sell us on a hugely expensive room upgrade by telling us the only room they had for our party was smack in the middle of a family block. We needed to repeatedly decline before they backed off. Then it seemed like every time we sat down to dinner there was an up charge offered again  and again - whether it was all wine, tomahawk steak/lobster, cabanas etc. Finally, the last straw for me was the drink pressure - always offering tequila when just water was requested, making fun of the folks in the group that elected to get non-alcoholic smoothies rather than mixed drinks, it was such a strange vibe. The drinking pressure seemed to be something the staff was trained to do because a lot of the same comments were repeated over and over by separate employees.  The food experience was mixed, many of the sit down places had very bland food and service was really lax at the later eating times. The buffet was great for breakfast, but lackluster for lunch on the days we went. Highlights were the poolside carved mango flowers with chamoy and the quesadilla and taco stations with freshly pressed tortillas to order.   Besides the drink pressure, the staff was very kind and attentive. The arrival and departure process was handled really efficiently.   Finally, there was something musty and occasionally foul smelling in the bathrooms (both main resort bathrooms and our individual room bathrooms), sort of a lingering odor that definitely made itself known throughout the stay. The swim-up bar also did get pretty rank in the afternoons so would avoid that at all costs. I also personally find dolphin exhibits problematic, and the fact that this resort had 6-7 dolphins in a tiny pool on resort grounds made me feel gross (I recognize that for some this would not be a con so take that with a grain of salt).   Overall, would not make a return trip and would not recommend to other travelers. ",1

Staff were very helpful also -there were tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but no milk! - staff ensured that I had a small jug of milk that i could put in the room fridge.  Only downside was the bathroom - made for small dwarves who didn't mind a shower tray the size of a tea tray - but water hot and power of shower reasonable  We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis (that is all that is available) - breakfast was continental and very good with plenty of variety  Close to Fira town itself which is very busy (and we didn't find that the prices increased when the cruise ships came in) with some excellent restaurants and bars - don't get caught out by trying to get a branded imported beer in some of the bars, they are very expensive!  Try the local beers, there are some very good ones, or buy  imported beers from the local shops or kiosks (much cheaper)  Restaurants are for all pockets and tastes, plenty of variety and locations.  Food excellent, gyros/pizzas/a la carte are all there.

Reading the reviews here and all the cancellations, it would explain why the hotel is cancelling rooms without explanation.  We asked to use the stairs and were told there was no stairs. One of our party has a fear of lifts and had to use dark back stairs that were locked. We discovered that the stairs also went from the lower lobby which is the main access to the shelter.   The hotel didn’t warn us not to use the restrooms in the lower lobby, these were the only restrooms in reception. In fact when asked where the facilities were, this is where they sent us.

42169,"I was booked to stay overnight at the Ala Moana Hotel by a company I work for, meals included, and I was really looking forward to it!  On check-in, arriving at noon after a very long overnight flight from Australia, I was told my room would be ready at 3 pm. The receptionist handed me my meal vouchers and told me to go and have lunch...  😞  It was a disappointing welcome, so I sought out the DaDa Cafe that was listed on my $30 coupon and ordered $26 of food and a drink. With taxes, it was $32. I had no local currency, so i cancelled the drink..   I'd like to point out I couldn't order a main course as they were all priced over $30.  I then waited another 2 and a half hours (I had hoped to go sightseeing at this stage) and got into my room in the Kona Tower at 3 pm.   Yes, the room is pretty basic with a view of the multi-level carport next door.  I finally freshened up and did a couple of hours seeing the sights before dinner.  I was looking forward to dinner as the coupon said it was in the Signature Steak and Seafood Restaurant.   I was given a dinner voucher for $42, but the cheapest main course was $47.95, so I was going to chip in some of my own money to get the full experience.   However, on arrival at the restaurant the maitre de inspected my voucher, said it would really be about $36 after tips and taxes, and suggested I sit at the bar as ""service would be quicker"".  I thanked her but explained I'd rather have a table (there were at least 12 empty tables).   As she guided me to a table, she said, ""If you like, you can get it to go and enjoy it in your room.""  She clearly did NOT want me in her restaurant.   Suddenly, the allure was gone, so I ordered French onion soup, a Caesar salad, and a coke... all of which arrived on my table within 3 minutes.  I ate as fast as I could and got out.  THAT is what I will remember about my stay at the Ala Moana Hotel.

15721,"Unfortunately we were here in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic just as Miami Beach was shutting down.  The hotel was fine though pricey, but I suppose everything on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach during Spring Break is.  It's clean and they give you a nice trolley with beach towels, beach chairs and an umbrella to take across the street.  Unfortunately they don't give you a broom to sweep up the inevitable sand that comes with it.  Also there is one hook in the entire room so you can only hang up one towel!  Room was very quiet, I didn't hear anyone around me.  Valet parking is $42 a night.  Hotel is right on Ocean Drive which can be very busy.  If you don't like that, don't stay here.  But it is very close to shopping, beach, restaurants!",1

This is a family business and they do a fine job multi tasking and taking care of their guests. Continental breakfast includes Kurig coffee, tea and hot chocolate along with juice, fruit, croissants and pastry.  This motel is a short ride to several attractions and less than a mile walk to Fisherman's Wharf. We would stay here again!",1
32851,"We booked a $5,000/night Corner Suite and I reached out to the concierge for some restaurant, private car and tour guide reservations. After 5 days, they never responded, not even after I simply asked for an acknowledgement of receipt of my email, and stated they could get back to me at their convenience. Nothing. This is unlike every other 5 star property we have stayed at which always respond at least with an acknowledgement. So, unfortunately, the recent complaints about their concierge are true - they are bad and unhelpful. Therefore, we cancelled our reservation with MO Tokyo and are staying at another property whose concierge responds within 24 hours of every email request like a propert y5 star hotel should do. Bad form MO Tokyo!",1
46528,"This is a 4-star hotel and is understandably not luxurious. It does, however, provide the basic things travelers need. A simple breakfast (consisting of bread, cereal, yoghurt, coffee and juice) is provided for each day, and bathroom supplies are replenished whenever necessary. As mentioned, it’s nothing fancy, but the location is quite good. The area, which is across a big park, is pleasant. It’s also easy to get to restaurants and places of interest from here, and there are convenience stores nearby. During our stay, the persons at the front desk were helpful, giving us tips we needed and even leaving the front desk once to hail a cab for us.  One thing that turned us off during our stay here was the housekeeping service. The day after we checked in, we were quite tired so we stayed in during the morning. A little before 1pm, I got a call from a lady who apparently was the person assigned to service our room. She told me that she was done cleaning the other rooms on our floor, and that our room was the last room that needed to be serviced. I asked her if she could come in 10 or 20 minutes as we would already be out by that time. She told me in a very rude, demanding tone that she needed to clean our room already and that if we didn’t allow her to clean it then, she would leave and would no longer come back. I asked if it would be okay if they work in the room while we were there and she said that that would be fine. She came in with a younger lady who she appeared to be training. The older lady entered our room without saying a word to any of us, and proceeded to give orders in a very brash manner to the trainee about how to fix the beds. She then went to the sink to wash the few dishes that were in it. She did this with a lot of noise, as though she was slamming the plates and utensils. When she was done, she went to the landline to call someone who presumably was another member of the housekeeping staff. She spoke to the other person in a very loud and irritated tone, not at all mindful that there were guests in the room. After that, she went back to the trainee to tell her what to do in the bathroom. She was obviously quite annoyed with the younger lady and even verbally insulted her (saying things like “You don’t use your brain!”) in our presence. When they were done, she just exited the room while murmuring something and without saying anything to any of us. It was the younger lady who greeted me when they entered, and it was she who also said a meek but very polite goodbye as they were leaving.  I realize that this isn’t a 5-star hotel, and we adjusted our expectations while we were there. However, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect basic courtesy from members of the staff of any establishment providing accommodations to paying guests. I understand that the staff needs to stick to a schedule which is precisely why I allowed them to service the room while we were there, and why we all kept quiet and tried to stay out of their way so they could easily finish what needed to be done. However, the way this lady spoke to me was impertinent and offensive. To the trainee, her remarks were disparaging and hurtful. Even if the scope of the daily housekeeping services of this hotel is limited to fixing the beds, changing the towels, and collecting the trash (other chores beyond that, they no longer do), I still think that a respectful attitude toward guests and toward their fellow staff members is something that should be expected of every employee of the hotel.",1

The service of the restaurant is excellent, the buffet is also very rich, and it is worth five stars in this link.",1
15970,"Hotel was ok. Good location if you want to be in downtown. Negatives are as follows: 1 - Upon check in we were directed straight to the concierge who tried to sell us a 90 minute talk the next day for a timeshare to Wyndham resorts. Not a great start. I can’t express how much this bugged us. Being talked at by the concierge who wanted an answer there and then if we were going to attend or not.  2 - The parking. They don’t tell you that it is only valet parking available at approx. £50 per night (depending on the exchange rate). No self parking option is available. The issue isn’t necessarily the price, which is only £10 more than parking elsewhere in the city) its the fact that they don’t tell you before hand. I think the cost should be added to the room rate so it’s not a hidden charge, but then people may not stay because they’d be more expensive than other hotels. I felt duped.  3 - Tea and coffee are in the room in day 1, but they aren’t replenished during the stay. How much would it really cost to offer replenishments? They advertise tea and coffee making facilities, you assume this is for the whole stay. 4 - Our room was not made up and the sheets weren’t changed during our 3 night trip.  As I say at the start, best thing is the hotels location if you want to be in downtown. It’s a 40 minute walk to pier 39, but it’s a safe easy walk. There are hundreds of bars restaurants and shops in easy walking distance.  However, upon reflection, I’d rather be nearer to Fishermans wharf.",1

We selected the hotel as it was convenient to visiting friends. We booked a suite on the ground floor with a small cooking and sink area. There were no utensils or typical kitchen pack you get in similar European hotels. On request to the reception none were delivered. The light failed in the outer eating area again no response after reporting. Finally when you used the shower there was a smell of drains, again no response. We stayed for three nights, any longer we would have left. The hotel has excellent travel links and is adjacent to a major hospital and we were not disturbed by any noise.",1

Until you try to get out of bed in the middle of the night and can’t get the privacy screen up because the flat bed is right up against it. So you have to raise the bed enough to get the screen up, hoping the noise of the bed moving doesn’t wake your neighbours. I saw so many people struggling to work out how to raise those screens, whether from inside or outside the pod. Definitely an issue.   I found I was cold in the middle of the night and the shower area was cold too. Probably great in the summer.   One night I had a projector pod. Definitely gimmicky. Didn’t work very well. More trouble than it was worth.   Breakfast provided. Good kitchen, nice seating area. Good hot shower. ",1

26859,The staff was not accommodating in get the room I wanted even though I had to work from the room all week. The room I got was dated and had a few issues. You may not notice in a different hotel but given the price point of this hotel it’s insane to charge someone 50 dollars extra a night to face the lake when the room type booked is the same. Honestly the Marriott across the street was better and had a better pool.,1
7915,When we checked in we were told by the lady at check-in that we did not have breakfast included with our room which I thought was a mistake because I thought I booked with breakfast. Therefore every morning we walked down the street and got a croissant and coffee and did not eat at the hotel. At check-out the gentleman insisted that we ate breakfast with them every day because we had booked it that way I tried to explain to him what we were told at check in and that we did not eat breakfast anyway it turned into a battle / embarrassing battle in The lobby. He kept saying it’s in our computer you eat breakfast although they don’t check anyone to see if they ate breakfast they had  no way of keeping up with who eats breakfast and who doesn’t and I insisted that he discuss this with his employee who had given us misinformation and he refused in the end I ended up paying for something I did not receive I have to say I traveled all over France for three weeks the only place I found for where people were unfriendly rude nonsmiling nonhelpful were the Parisians and it’s really funny because when I was in Lyon that’s the way they referred to the Parisians I think they understand the bad name France gets is from The Parisians!!

35117,"Lucky to be an early recipient of government quarantine change to 3-nights. Arrived around 2:30pm on a Thursday and left lunchtime Sunday.  Smooth check-in with paperwork and information exchanged. Was asked if I needed lunch, even at 2:30pm but I said no...... half an hour later, lunch arrived. One large bottle of water per day, large window to an open view, reasonable sized working table and a small fridge (large enough for the water bottle to lay down).  Nice touch to add an HDMI cable to the TV, used that to connect my laptop and get more than the ~6channels available in English.  Room appeared clean in the beginning but slowly found more and more long black/brown hair, 100% opposite of mine.  Pillows are inside plastic bags and placed inside a normal pillow case. Contrary to comment about ""Government Regulation"" I had a friend on the same flight as me, in a different hotel, that did not have his pillows inside the plastic bag. It appears, then, to have to do with cost and how to sanitize the pillow itself. So, pillows are a bit noisy for sleep but can begin to understand why Dorsett is on the cheaper side.  Food was edible, some better than others for sure but no complaint.  Room was quiet, couldn't hear anything from outside or other rooms. Was a rattle from inside the roof, I think from an aircon connection/vent but given the noise from the pillow, it didn't have much effect.  Finally....... Oliver, thank you!",1
33256,"Bondi Beach House is just about perfect for us. We visited our son who lives on Bronti Beach and we stayed for two weeks with a weeks stay in Melbourne in the middle. The ladies (Fenda & Hazel) looked after our extensive cases while we travelled. The beach house is spotless and furnished with interesting pottery and pictures. Lovely to sit in the garden in the morning sun and enjoy a breakfast which is just right. Bondi Beach is one of the most famous beaches in the world but won't suit all people, for us it's an area full of life and surfing culture - you can sit and people watch all day. We are a couple in our late sixties and enjoy the cosmopolitan mix of the Bondi Community and felt very much at home and safe.  Thank you Fenda, it was a joy to stay with you. Mike & Helen Davies.

5649,"The beaches are beautiful. We went 19-30th September & everywhere was closing down for winter. The hotel is advertising entertainment but all that was available some bloke in a beany hat put the some music on from his laptop & just hung around the place & it was the same music that was played all day at the pool. The food got less & less as we headed into the 2nd week with mainly just pork on the menu. Even the coffee machines around the pool bar were cleaned out & shutdown on the Thursday when people were still in the hotel &. Using the pool services till Sunday. No sauces or any juice in the machines either. I think it is unfair that people have paid for full all inclusive services then not receive them especially when other hotels nearby had entertainment acts on right to the end of September. The hotel itself was clean & towels changed everyday. This hotel does not house or cater for English. The resort Sunny Beach is a bit of a dump, the pavements are all smashed up & very uneven so if you have mobilty issues or in a wheelchair then it's not for you. Lots of derelict buildings & weeds growing. The central area is shop after shop of selling fake goods & night time is just like Blackpool. Live acts & pubs are open 24/7 & only start at 11pm so be aware if youre booking a hotel near the centre. Sunny Beach may have been good about 20 years ago but they've haven't done anything with the resort since.  Nessebar is good to look around a lovely traditional village with some nice restaurants which we ended going to 4 times just for something/ where to go. This hotel & resort was meant to be 4/5 star but it's just about a 3.",1

39018,"I was traveling with my mother who is in a wheelchair. We didn't get the disable room because it was full when we arrived.  The problem is there is a one step (about 10 cm) from the corridor to the room. The step down was not recognizable if you come out of the room. My mother actually fell down from her wheelchair and hit her head because of the accident. For the first two days, my mother couldn't stand up at all (might because of the trauma).  I tried talking with the Manager (Ms Pauline) and giving her feedback about the room. At least giving signage at the door saying that there is a step down once we come out of the room. Which she always reply ""Its already the government standard"". I even asked her to check the CCTV to see how hard my mother fell. But I guess she didn't give care at all. She didn't apologize or even get back to me saying she watched the CCTV. Such a poor Customer Relation.  Also, we stayed there for 3 days, the sheet wasn't changed. If you need a change of towel after 5 pm, you'll have to come down to the reception with your used towel. When I come down, the reception wasn't even doing anything just chating.  Overall, customer service was really bad in Le Grove Service Apartment.",1

6897,"Great property. They say it is a hostel, but in reality vast majority of the property is a basic hotel.   Location is good, 5~10 min walk from Sham Shui Po and Shek Kip Mei MTR. Lots of local food choices and grocery stores around. It's up a little sidestreet so it's quiet.   Rooms are passable, larger than typical Hong Kong, but very basic. We booked 2 twin beds. Mattresses are awful - hard and springy. Lighting is mediocre and wifi is slow as dialup. No plug ins near bed for charging. If staying in winter, this property does not have heating.   Cleanliness and maintenance has declined over the last few years we have stayed here. The floors don't look clean at all, with lots of dust and hair in the corners and under the beds. Looks like it has been a long time since the floors were deep cleaned. Common areas like elevators, hallways and lobby showing signs of wear and tear. The property is starting to look tired and worn out, despite being 5 years old.   Common use kitchen and laundry areas are okay. If you're here in Hong Kong, it's easier to eat out or get take out than to cook here. Coin operated laundry is nice, save your coins and the front desk runs out of coins too. Laundry soap is automatic and included.   Restaurant downstairs is just bad. The included breakfast was awful. Convenient and free, but we would eat off site or bring take out back more than half the time.",1
21659,"I hate to leave a negative review, but I have been meaning to leave feedback for a while on a dinner cruise my boyfriend and I took in January. I had been really looking forward to celebrating our anniversary with a romantic dinner cruise, however after having difficulty finding the yacht initially, we were boarded on to a tiny, very unexciting smaller boat which looked nothing like what we had paid for or anticipated. We were told that the water was too high for the use of the main boat, but I would have appreciating being told this in advance as it really was quite disappointing and verging on claustrophobic. I had fortunately booked a Groupon so it was not full price, but it was still a lot of money for the experience we ended up having. I don't know if it really was because the tides were too high or because there weren't enough people, but overall I was sorry that it was not a more memorable experience on the boat that I had thought we would be taking. The food was okay, but not as good as hoped for either.",1

Previously we could just snorkel 5 meters from the beach to see many many different types of fishes.  Read online there was an oil spill recently and that could have killed everything .  Also the warm hospitality we received on our first visit all but disappeared - few staff spoke English and even we had to pay for drinking water in the room.  And the condition of the room is very bad too - the air-conditioners were snoring all the time and my son's toilet did not have hot water despite our several times complaining.  Television was a crappy TV box with limited number of channels.  Most irritating was the huge number of insects and pests, especially at breakfast.  Not sure if management understands what pest control means. Or to them it's just placing a sticky fly trap right next to the breakfast counter?  We were so traumatised and disgusted  by the number of flies caught that were on public display that we decided to just have a toast and coffee.  We are definitely disappointed with this stay and have decided to strike this hotel off our list for good.",1

Of course, two other rooms on the first floor had same mold smell so we refused to move. at the end another room was offered so we moved in as it was less moldy. But we had to keep balcony door open during the day. .During first days of stay we saw maintenance staff with pumps spraying mold cleaner in the rooms.  Bad in the room was good, but noisy. If you move during the night  you can wake up entire family. Food in restaurant was very good, but sometimes the food that was left from lunch was served for dinner as well. Service in the bars was excellent. . Hotel had an outdoor pool  for adults and kids. The hotel is located next to the beach. The beach is well maintained. The only problem was finding sun beds, as they were in smaller number than guests and located far from the sea.  Entertainment in the hotel was good. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere. There was no public transport nearby. Taxi would cost you $100 to Antalya (55km distance) and to rent a vehicle at the hotel $60. The shop at the hotel is very expensive. The toy that would normally cost no more than $5, would cost there $40. The positive thing in this hotel is very friendly staff to include reception, restaurant, bar and beach, but I can not say the same for some managers.

However I was really disappointed by the breakfast - the breakfast room was very busy and staff struggled to clear tables which doesn’t really give the impression of a COVID-safe environment. The selection at breakfast was poor, there wasn’t any fresh fruit for example. The bar was also lacking atmosphere and was too expensive for what it was.",1
8982,"We stayed at the Old Capital Bike Inn for a total of 3 days. The hotel is very well located and central to Bangkok and looked after very well by its staff who are friendly, helpful and do a very good breakfast, both local and western options.   We had the honeymoon suite and mainly choose this for the outdoor bath. However, the bath was almost unusable due to the length of time it takes to fill. We ended up not using it at all.   There are steep stairs up to the bedroom and then down to the bathroom which we feel should have been better communicated.   The bedroom does not have any natural light so tends to be quiet a dark space.   We felt it was quite high priced.   Other than the couple above points, it was a pleasant stay.",1
32042,"The rooms are cheap but once you arrive you realize everything about this place is very pricey. Meals are around 65,000. The issue is that the hostel is not near anything, so you are basically trapped and have to buy expensive food / drinks. In addition, I saw someone lose their key and they charged 100,000! More than 1 night stay. Crazy! This place is nice, but a complete money machine. Come here if you've got cash to blow.",1
21279,"Just returned after a nice week at this hotel. On arrival and being shown the room, the first impression was it needed a revamp as it was looking tired but it was clean and tidy so was ok. The room had a free safe, kettle and hairdryer and tv that was really unwatchable due to the poor reception and air con which worked well. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool which were taken early but beach sunbeds were available through the the day. Prices at the hotel are very expensive as is the theme throughout the island although if you go to the main road the prices are a little cheaper. Hotel staff are really nice and helpful and the ladies who cleaned are lovely. Getting around is simple as all buses go to Thira and from there you can change buses to wherever you want to go. We enjoyed our stay as it is a beautiful island but won't return as there are lots of other palaces to visit.",1
7413,"Filthy room and total lack of care or responsibility/ I was over charged for my room and have had to lodge a dispute with my credit card provider as Reception couldn't care less   I had to wait whilst another room was cleaned after being put in a room where every noise in the  work areas could be heard and it was filthy. Carpets not vacuumed, mould in shower and broken tiles , shower head filthy .  I went to make a cup of tea and the kettle in my room was filthy with rust . When I asked for a refund I was denied and given another room only slightly better  Whilst I  was at front desk three people had to ask if there room would be cleaned today ",1
39009,"Stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom room which looked amazing on the website and upon arrive , staff Don’t care when you arrive or even greet you , I feel like this place someone is dead or management is so bad that staff aren’t happy and don’t really want to work there . It seems to me that it’s a family run apartment with not the right standards in place , the disappointing thing is that the rooms are really good . The stand out for me was the bus driver , we had a baby and had also made us feel welcome every time and when he saw us walking back to the hotel he would always wVe to us , it was nice considering the front staff have no personality what so ever , all they do is sit and chat .

31199,"A terrible experience. Had to move rooms twice and what we ended up with was still not a 4 star room. The shower was tiny, (reached up to my chest when i finally squeezed in) the boiler was directly over the toilet (banged my head) the window was a small skylight, we had an air conditioning unit the size of a fridge stuck in the middle of the room. The bedroom door did not shut automatically (hello health and safety). Just looked on the hotel website and the rooms there look lovely and i wished I stayed there - Oh wait a minute I did!!!",1
46407,"Nice hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are clean, but not very spacious. If you want to be close to the beach, this hotel is a good option. Also, it is on 15min walk to the Arco de Triunfo.  Breakfast is nice, and you have the option of buying some snack food during the whole day. The hotel is a 100% non-smoking, so you can't smoke on the terrace, or on the rooftop (openair) pool - if you are a smoker, maybe that can be a problem for you, but if you're not, it's a big plus :) I'm rating this hotel with 4 because of few details that a didn't like (and I think that this only apply on our room) - the two of us were in the room, and we've got only one small complimentary water, the trash can couldn't be opened, and the door of the shower had a small hole, so we had water on the bathroom floor after showering.

If you order anything from house keeping or room dinning make sure you have half day with you. ",1
38970,"We booked a double room at the end of the high season and were therefore focused on avoiding the rip-off prices of other hotels in touristic areas. Acta Antibes is a 2-star establishment and one cannot expect the level of service and lost of amenities of a 4-star, but the basic requirements were met: clean room, bedsheets and bathroom, free wifi and friendly staff.  The breakfast buffet was a bit limited in choice and its price was not included in the room. I found that it deserved to be, all things considered. The hotel location is not exceptional, but we already knew our way around in the city, so it was a minor inconvenience. For the purpose of our trip, Acta Antibes did the job, but it may not have all the frills regular tourists look for.",1
16645,"We we're completely dissatisfied with the lack of room cleaning and extremely slow service.   Took the bell boy over an hour to bring up our luggage.  Our infant was without diapers and baby food.  When we asked for a baby tub, they said they will bring it right up.. Only for me to have to call again the next day, and show up 24 hours later.  This isn't a hotel.  This is more of a Campsite as there's no service whatsoever.   We were never notified of their ""Union Strike"" when we booked and checked in the hotel.  Totally unacceptable.  After speaking to a manager that was ""looking into"" cleaning our room and after no response, we checked out and went to another hotel that actually had great service and much closer to everything.",1
45863,"I want to share my recent experience at this hotel, which I regretfully cannot recommend. The hotel has an attractive location but is marred by a lack of basic amenities and poor customer service.  During our six-night stay, we discovered on the second morning that there was no hot water. We informed the receptionist, Andy, but were met with a dismissive and rude attitude. We were informed that there would be no hot water for the rest of the day, and this lack of basic amenities was for a total of three days of the six days of our stay.   Please note that according to California Civil Code §1940.2, it is the responsibility of the hotel to provide and maintain hot and cold running water for guests.  To make matters worse, when we requested to check out early due to this issue, we were offered no refunds as our stay was prepaid on expedia.  Expedia told us that the property was to decide while the property said it was expedia.. As I am a hotelier myself, I know it is the hotel’s call in the end.  We were offered a shower facility in a separate building which was very inconvenient as we had to walk out of our building and take elevators to get there.. This was not a suitable alternative to the basic amenity that we had paid for. To add insult to injury, at time of check out, Andy offered us only $80 as a refund on a reservation worth over $1500, what a humiliating act, we could not believe it!  Better not to offer anything, because really it is a shame to offer this to people..  We were one of the many customers to complain, and we saw that the receptionists had no sympathy towards anyone.. Yes, all businesses are there to make money, but not like this.  What they did is close to stealing from someone!  I cannot recommend this hotel to other travelers, and I will continue to write on other platforms to warn people..",1
23023,"Briefly on of the worst hotels i’ve ever visited in tunisia. If you wanna come to this hotel or you’re trying to book a room change your direction asap. Let me start First the day we came we checked at 14 but we took our rooms at 16 which is two hour delay then when I got it I just realized that it is completely in a mess so I went to the reception I told him that this the room is in a mess and that you cannot stay in a room like that so They told me that the guests that are before us checked out so late I told him it’s OK so when I got back from swimming at 18 I just got into the room and a phone doubt that it is in a mess oh I get back to the reception and I told them that that I’m not satisfied with the service and that stuff but they told me to speak with the manager when I spoke to her she told me that the pass of the women who’s cleaning the room does not work i got mad and when i got into the restaurant i found out that the food is extremely awful i just spent 3 days with my friends without eating anything in the hotel.  Basically, one of the worst experiences ever",1

Hardly an identity thief,  the reason we were given for the changed rules.  Told we would have to cancel, and re-book under another of our 4 family members. Cancellation and expensive last minute re-book fees would apply!!!!! After 45mins of negotiations extra charges were waived. No notification after rules were changed previous day regarding compulsory ID. Nanny nap after travel from Armidale, Tamworth and Melbourne, prior to Party, was out of the question.  There is also no on-site pool, but shared pool down the street.  Poor advertising and compassion skills. 2 bedroom Apartment was faultless and extremely spacious and comfortable.",1

59745,"This hotel is horrible from all aspects: 1. Space: the hotel is very small (except for the lobby), there are no green spaces for a walk, the parking is not big enough to house all residents cars, the rooms are small. 2. Personnel: The reception guys are not organized, the checkin was supposed to be 2PM but they gave us the keys at 5PM, the young lady with the short black hair was rude enough to not ask for excuse for the delay but instead she talked in a very mean way that there would be no late checkout, as if it were our fault to give the keys 3 hours late!!! As for restaurant and bar guys they were very polite and welcoming.  Hygiene and organization: The rooms were not very well dusted as a consequence the rooms trigged allergy issues for all of us. Besides for a triple room there were only two big and two small towels and two duvet (believe it or not i slept with my hoodie on since i couldnt find the reception number anywhere in the room).  Location and comfort: The location is not very good as the hotel is surroundrd by populair neighberhood and since there was no sound isolation in the rooms, you cant have any rest as you will always be hearing the sound of the cars, the nearby disco and even a fight in the neighberhood. That night was a nightmare for all of us we couldnt have any rest.  Food and beverage: The food was acceptable with nothing special, the cheese and the coffee were terrible. Wierdly the last lunch was good, I m not sure what happend. ",1

We were offered a room change but we were both tired from work so we had to request for an air freshener instead. Toilet STINKS we don’t even know where the smell is coming from.   We even had to request for a mattress topper, as their bed is really HARD.

Direct Disney bus shuttle available (the main reason for choosing this hotel) but unfortunately it was already fully booked upon check-in for the next day service.  Airport bus stops at the hotel door.   No major attraction nearby except the Skytree Tower.  There are many small eateries, shops and launderettes around. Room is clean and decent sized compared to the average hotel in Tokyo.  Firm bed which is good for problem backs but maybe a little too much for others.  Keen service provided by the English speaking staff at reception. Disney bus aside there may be more hotel choices closer to the city and other attractions for the same price.",1

29338,"Staying at the shangri la hotel in Shenzhen was great. The people were so welcoming and friendly and so helpful when trying to find our way around. Its located right next to the metro railway station and commercial city shopping. Although the room itself was  antiquated everything else made up for it and it was just what we needed after our travel from Australia to hong Kong then arrival to Shenzhen. They did allow us to check in 5 hours early which was so good of them. The gym and pool facilities are good, unfortunately some guys just need some help with the correct form when lifting weights however no reflection on the hotel at all. The space was not crowded it was just right plenty of room for everyone. The spa sauna and steam room are insane along with the massage chairs down there. Ots like a little haven. Soooo good to relax in after a full days walking the shopping streets of Shenzhen. Breakfast is amazing! Mixture of both asian and western hot and cold breakfast, also the traditional continental and all the trimmings. So delicious! Recommend staying at Shangri La at least one night to enjoy all it has to offer.",1

Indian restaurant is in the premises but not worth going there as service is slow and food quality is not upto the mark and we should also not expect the taste as per restaurants in India.",1
28806,"I was supposed to get an early check-in, which turned into a 3-hour wait in the bar and a 4 pm check-in.   The bar service was absolutely horrible.  You have several people standing around, but to get a drink you have to walk up to the bar.  Then they don't know how to make most drinks.  Forget martinis, cosmos, old fashion, so you switch to wine and their house wines and or inexpensive wines are just bad.  We were a group of 6, and had to return several drinks and or left unfinished drinks or wine. Next was dinner at their steak restaurant.  Our group returned two meals, only to get back just s bad.  Steaks ordered medium rare that were totally brown throughout both times and the quality of the was more gristle and fat than beef.  I should have returned mine but I am always afraid they'll spit in my food. Rooms were ok. To use the pool or spa you had to pay a fee - REALLY.  It was small but REALLY.  Then in the middle of the night some sort of team or fans are drunk yelling and screaming right outside my room.  This went off and on from 2 am to 4 am.  It also happened outside of our friend's rooms on different floors.  The next morning the hotel was filled with orange shirt security people, but this was a day late. Then came to check out, mind you, they were busy, but 45 minutes.  There is no line so people push right in front of you.  There are 4 people behind the counter but only 2 are working checkout - who knows what the other 2 ever did.  Then when I finally got through the mob and I am next, someone down the counter waved and the person that was supposed to help me next leaves her post to go down and help them - they NEVER stood in line for a minute.  This after 3 couples who had just showed up pushed in front of me.  Suppose to be a vacation and this just makes your blood boil.  Then a whole bunch of minor little charges, that by now you are so late you don't get to tell them what they can do with their charge for I swear for using the elevator.   There are so many nice hotels in Bucharest with great service - why would anyone go to the Radisson.",1

25237,"Most unhelpful customers service I've ever seen in a hotel. Due to a date miscommunication my date the initial booking (made with points with my Visa details down for collateral) was incorrect and thus would be a no show, I accepted that this was my fault and agreed with losing the points and I rebooked a room with with my Mastercard, I the helpline just to confirmed that I'd lose the points and the woman I spoke to confirmed that yes I'd lost the points, but nothing else would happen, which was fine, since that was totally my fault.  Two days later two charges show up on my Visa card one for what was I assume was my rebooking, which as I mentioned I booked with my other card (I confirmed this on another call) and another that was substantially more with no explanation.  So I called up the first call I was told she would call the hotel and then get back to me, but she never did. The 2nd day I called up I was transferred and a ticket was made and I was told the hotel would get back to me the next day. Again I never hard back and was hung up on twice when being transferred or getting my details taken when I tried to call back myself.   On the fifth day I called again and finally got a Customer Service rep with gumption that actually checked with the hotel what was going on and said that there was the no show fee (which is a 1/3rd more expensive than the cost of booking the whole room mind you) but the points would be returned, which is the complete opposite of what the first rep I spoke to said (points would be lost, but nothing else). I asked what could be done and was told absolutely nothing, I asked about why the other booking was charged to the wrong card and again was told absolutely nothing. So after 5 days of having to chase myself I'm left with nothing.  Worst customer service experience I've had in my life, will never deal with an InterContinental Hotels Group hotel ever again.",1
23488,"Overall, it’s a great place to stay, good view, nice staff. But having a comfortable sleep is probably the most important thing you want in a hotel or a hostel, however that doesn’t really work if the room temperature is 25 degrees Celsius with no way of cooling it down. I could use the air conditioner before 9:30pm but the “fan” setting was the only mode that worked “cool” “heat” and “dry” didn’t do anything, I may just be doing something wrong, but I couldn’t use it nonetheless. However, around about 9:45pm the air conditioner was “centrally controlled” (see image) and the person staying in the room, has no control of the climate. The room started to heat back up again, and there was nothing I could do about it. Just great…",1

We paid £430 each including flights and coach transfer with Love Holidays. Took a chance at that price. Really awful food.. Actually smells iin the dining room... Obviously left-overs recycled in sauces or Baked as fritatta. Room extremely basic... Bit grotty and 2 - 3 star. Loud thudding music played at the pool area.. Drove us away... Hope it stops soon.

' In the morning we did not get a cooked breakfast , which we had paid for. Although the breakdown may not have been the direct responsibility of the hotel, I think we had the right to claim a partial refund of the amount paid, at least the cost of the missed breakfasts on 10 March. as a  compensation for these inconveniences. We hoped for a positive response from the managment as proof of their customer-friendliness. But the management refused.

480,I wish someone had written this review for me before. I would have avoided wasting my money on this hotel.  The Starhotels Echo is located on top of TWO SUBWAY LINES (so told me the receptionist) and you can feel trains go by every few minutes. Trains go between 6:30AM and 12:00AM. When I first checked in I was assigned a room on a lower floor.  When I realized the problem I was already in bed around 11PM. I asked if the hotel rooms were all the same and they said that the upper floors were better. I was moved to a room on the 5th floor. I had hope this would solve the problem but  IT DID NOT it was exactly the same if not worst!  If you have A LIGHT SLEEP like me I advise you to book a different hotel. I do not have any other complaint  but a hotel that does not offer good sleep quality is just awful to me.,1

At breakfast asked for spoon and staff proceeded to offer the spoon from the coffee cup/saucer just collected from a table companion and was reminded the spoon has been used.   Had prix fix lunch and the Jeff was very good.   Lounge has limited food options whether breakfast or after canapés.   In summary, less than comparable standards to full service Marriotts and Hiltons; way below Ritz and Conrad’s. Will skip this brand and stick with the regulars.",1
55269,"We got a good deal on this property. Rented 3 rooms. We had checked and we were able to drop off our bags before our rooms were ready. When I came back the rooms had be changed and each of us was on a different floor. It took me two tries to find our luggage. Room phones did not work Room to room so this made contact difficult. When I came back on the 2nd day my room card did not work nor did one of my fellow travelers. The rooms themselves are nicely appointed, comfortable beds and some views are nice and some downright terrible (construction site)The decor is quite nice and with better management I would highly recommend. The price we paid was good but if we had paid listed price I would give it 2 stars. The location is good and walkable to many places. My traveling companion had an issue with the restaurant.",1
3488,"My daughter stayed at the hotel in early June for 7 days quarantine. She did enjoy her stay. Unfortunately after her departure everything went to really bad. It took over 4 weeks to get the refund, even worse they tried to blame it on the bank for the process time where it was all along the hotel who didn’t process it until I had to complain. So think twice if you want to stay there!",1
10452,I stayed at the hotel for 4 days I'm disappointed buffet breakfast very small selection of food grill at the pool I didn't like it either there are no free umbrellas on the beach the same really the first time I was hungry the rooms are clean I will definitely not come back here I prefer hyatt ziva,1
11145,"The rooms are quite basic but have everything you need (we stayed in the standard double room with AC and an ensuite - no fridge or TV). It's clean and well looked after. The drain in our shower wasn't working well at one point and they got someone to look at it as soon as we mentioned it to them.  The staff were friendly and helpful. It's a family run place and feels very homely.  The breakfast is a little minimal (Coffee/tea with either toast and yoghurt, or cereal and yoghurt) but it's better than nothing. They sell cheap cold beer and soft drinks in the communal sitting area.  They provided a good laundry service (I think it was 50 baht per kilo).  The hotel is a quiet spot but within easy walking distance of the Khao San Road and the other roads around it. There is also a 7-11 at the end of the road which is very handy. Check out the sois on the other side of Sam Sen Road for places to eat, we found some good pad thai and seafood places.",1

Good location - close to Sagrada Familia.  Also able to walk to Casa Batllo and Casa Mila from the hotel.  Like the set-up with two room for our family of four.  Comfortable accommodation.",1
42995,"This has been the absolute worst stay of any Marriott hotel this past trip.  Most of the terrible things have nothing to do with the hotel but the hotel at no point helped the matters. This hotel needs to give more information to arriving guests... No ATM at airport, Taxis do not take credit card, Getting taxis in front of this hotel is nearly impossible and Taxi drivers can just say NO they dont want to take you anywhere.   On top of this and possibly the greatest of the situations is that the hotel will not take the prepayment my company sent over. This prepayment was sent over a month ago. When I get here they tried to tell me it was only for authorization or whatever. This is the first hotel in the past month that has given me an issue with payment. All the others have been perfect. If they have a different method of preauthorized payments, then why were we not informed? They then told me they would send my company a link to which they sent it to me and not my company. I sent it to my company, the link stopped working. We tried inputting the card payment and it won't take the payment. This hotel needs to inform its guests on these rules.   My first night here my neighbors came screaming into their room yelling and fighting and slamming doors. I assume the man left because the girl spent the next 3 hours crying her eyes out and screaming. It was awful. Hotel eventually asked me if I wanted to move but it was 3 am and i had a 6 am meeting. As a platinum member, I cannot believe I was placed into an adjoining room where I could hear every bit of arguing and crying and screaming. And to this point, I question why I was not placed on the executive floor? Are platinum members no longer considered important enough since the switch to Bonvoy? That's what it seems. I have been traveling for years now and staying at Marriott forever and I have yet to feel appreciated by Marriott in general.   Breakfast both in the main brekfast area as well and especially the executive lounge need to step it up. Executive lounge food is hit or miss. One day it was amazing the next was bad but I guess that can be expected.   Kevin the concierge on the first floor along with his team are amazing and possibly the only staff members who genuinely care about the guests.   I am going to be honest, my biggest regret was not choosing the Sheraton down the street or the Westen where many of my colleagues are currently staying. From what they tell me, they are having an excellent time. I still have a few days here, maybe ill just switch now. Sheraton properties seem to be treating elite members much better these days.   Will not recommend Marriott Guangzhou Tianhe hotel to anyone and I don't believe i'll be back to this one during the major fair happening here.",1
26475,"I booked this hotel in advance and understood the no-refund policy.. I did the same with my air tickets not intending for anything to change.  My mother and I were meant to have this trip to Paris but we had a death in the family.  Still keeping intentions to make this trip, we were hoping to push the dates to after the funeral and keep the same hotel in place.  Unfortunately the hotel would not even change the dates despite the fact that Expedia agreed to.  It's a shame that there is such a lack of compassion, I will be booking another hotel in the end.. and the $300+ that I'm losing will just be pocketed by the hotel.",1
6858,"I had a room in fifth floor in which things seem normal. Local TV channels well received, beddings and decorative old Hong Kong items look clean and tidy. However, one of legs start itching after my stay, it almost forced me to find a skin doctor.  By the way, water in the bathroom is quite weak.  One interesting thing was that all guests had to return all begging items before checking out. ",1
52203,"It is a serviceable hotel. No huge complaints, no particular benefits. But I wouldn't go here for a holiday or leisure time. I'd probably try somewhere different for business next time too. If you get a good rate, it's fine but I wouldn't want to be paying top dollar.    I got okay sleep before construction noises in the mornings and the facilities are serviceable. Food options are limited.   The complex it is a part of was mundane and boring verging on highway robbery depending on which restaurants / mall stores you venture into. There's more authentic Filipino experiences not too far away thankfully.   The staff were mostly lovely, but very regimented. The atmosphere is not exactly relaxing. ",1
16235,"This hotel has a severe bed bug problem, it’s dingy DO NOT COME HERE THIS IS YOUR WARNING  The only thing good about it is the location thats it. Everyone was rude they talk about you in spanish, they barely have towels or wash clothes, they don’t give you the room you reserved. I had an allergic reaction from at least 20X bug bites. Check your sheets if you see blood stains and brown mattresses run before they get in your belongings and RUIN YOUR HOME",1
57941,"Overall: Do not stay here. Property is well below standards of St Regis brand and, quite frankly, the extremely high service we've received at other Japanese hotels (including Marriott properties as well as boutique hotels).   Concierge: Asked multiple times for help making dinner reservations, was told each time that they were busy but they would call back immediately. Waited 2+ hours before heading down ourselves only to find that both individuals were immediately available.  Butler Service: Was told butler would provide overview of room, never happened. No help offered to bring up luggage either.  Room / Interior: Very dated, can see visible wear and tear across most furniture. In need of renovations.  Ambassador Benefits: Informed of several benefits including 4pm check-out but promptly requested to check-out at 1pm (understandable given occupancy). No room upgrades offered (note: not required, but we were upgraded to suites at both the Westin Kyoto and Prince Gallery Kioicho during our stays).  Breakfast Service: Requested to go to smaller restaurant despite there being plenty of seating available at main restaurant; eventually seated, but 4 other parties seated after us including families. All other parties served food well before us while we waited 30+ minutes, server eventually came and apologized but left us bewildered by poor service.  Special Occasion: Celebrating partner's birthday, no acknowledgement (not a requirement by any means, but all other properties we've stayed including Westin Kyoto and Prince Gallery Kioicho Tokyo have been extremely accommodating and welcoming. Examples included: birthday cakes, complimentary sake, dessert boxes, etc.). Again, not a requirement at all but would have expected better service given the St. Regis brand.   Comparison to Other StRs / Marriotts: Unfortunately, the worst St. Regis we've stayed at and well below standard of other Marriotts despite the brand name. We've stayed at boutique hotels in Osaka as well and would strongly encourage others to do the same.  ",1
59866,"Despite the Front Office Manager- Vannica’s best efforts to exceed the guests expectations, both the Repugnant F&B Management and Staffs were bent on spoiling everything for everyone! It was a simple breakfast order and yet; they refused to accommodate to my request. Instead of a service recovery, they enlisted the help of the obnoxious security manager- Michael to evict me and treated me like I just stole something from them!  What was supposedly a pleasant and impeccable stay turns out to be a total disaster, an embarrassing nightmare; a parting gift from the repugnant F&B management and staffs including the obnoxious security manager- Michael; who behaves more like a street thug!",1
8422,"The hotel is in Koto-ku, 20 min by subway from Tokyo. You need to walk 15 minutes to the Toyocho station though. The hotel is well maintained, rooms are clean, well lit,  bigger than usual room size for Tokyo. Big windows with a view of the city. Room has amenities, kettle, coffee, tea, fridge. Good wifi coverage. Bathroom is clean, with amenities, hair drier.Bed is comfy, all comfortable. Ironing board you can borrow. The hotel has restaurants but you can go around for eating as there is a small commercial center just downstairs with restaurants, cafes and supermarket, very convenient. If you go to Tokyo, maybe the only thing would be walking for 15 min (dragging a heavy bag maybe tough) to the subway station or if you decide to take a bus(challenging for foreigners). There is a bus to the airport and they have shuttle service to the subway station but early in the morning...they have a shuttle bus also for Tokyo Disneyland for the ones interested. The staff is very attentive too, so a nice stay. I recommend.",1
34372,"I don’t have anything super negative or positive to say about our stay. I checked into rooms ahead of time using the app, but when we got there they had us in different rooms and what I chose. The front desk workers were very kind, but there were not enough people helping at the front desk for the amount of people trying to check in and the worker seemed very overwhelmed. Once we were able to get into our rooms the rooms were not cleaned extremely well. There faucets and sinks did not look like they had been cleaned at all so we wiped them down ourselves. In one of our rooms there were stains on the sheets and comforter so we replace them with the blankets in the closet. The beds were comfortable and the location was nice. It was a quick walk to get to the aquarium, museums, and lake walk. Check out was easy and quick and they were willing to hang onto our bags after we checked out so that we could explore the city until our train left.",1

19824,"To the General Manager,  I would like to address a few concerns my partner and I had during our stay at the Park Hyatt. Before arrival we had contacted the concierge to ask about a few tours and recommendations around the city. The queue until someone answered was always very long and hard to reach someone. When we did reach the concierge we had issues conversing as they had trouble understanding our requests, we needed to be transferred multiple times until Someone was able to assist us. They didn’t seem to have the resources to help us research or book any tours. When we checked in at 3 am the front desk personnel said the manager would call us about an upgrade the next day and we never received a call.  During the stay we noticed there was a lack of warmth from the staff in pleasantries. Although we appreciate the presence of your staff it’s the warmth and greetings that we felt were lacking. When we asked for a simple water or tea there was either a long wait or lack of greeting. When we were at breakfast there was a lack of vegetables to accompany some items that should go with your buffet items. When asked for a vegetable the host and waitress didn’t seem to accommodate us until we pressed further, they had said it’s an extra charge. We felt that this stay was very business transactional and lacked the warmth that should make our stay feel welcomed and luxurious.   When I informed the room service to replenish the juice in the fridge they didn’t. I requested pizza one night which you didn’t have and when it was delivered via Ubereats the front desk said he is short staffed and could not bring the food to my room so I had to get out of bed at midnight to go downstairs.   I would like to mention the beauty of the hotel amenities and cleanliness of the hotel.   We hope this email allows you to help the staff understand the importance of a warm and timely service without the hassle of making multiple attempts.",1
59797,"I’m currently visiting for work and my expectations weren’t high.  Was excited by the hotel when found out I’d be here, but even for work is just ok.    The good:  lovely view, nice looking rooms that are bright.  Reception and bar staff were  very nice.  Didn’t use pool but looks beautiful.  The beachfront is across a street, but I think they all are.  Very quiet hotel even on weekend nights so probably would not be very excited to stay on vacation.  Outside pool and bar close early.  Breakfast was decent.   It is centrally locates and waking distance to restaurants.    The Not Good:  my god the rooms are hot and the air conditioning either does not work or barely works.  Kept trying to turn down air all night without success.  Companions had same issue in their rooms.  With air on full blast the temperature was still 25 (80) degrees!   Need to leave balcony door open all night but then you have a lot of street noise.  TV doesn’t work.   Not big for me because I don’t watch much, but would be annoyed if I wanted it.  Summary: fine if you are looking for a clean, decent hotel for a short stay and if you don’t mind no AC.  Would be really angry if I had paid for a week for a nice vacation.    I have no idea whether what other area resort hotels are like, so maybe it rated well comparably.  ",1
56132,"Spent 2 weeks at Ibis Seef Hotel before I could enter Saudi. Check-in process was quick and easy. Staff from front of house and room service was good, especially the boy bringing daily breakfast- he is very friendly and always serve with smile.  Talk about breakfast, as the restaurant is not allow to open for dine-in so daily breakfast was brought to the room with 3 choices and honestly the portion was so small compared to the buffet picture of the breakfast on the website. I chosen this hotel because of breakfast and it important during this time but breakfast really let down with small portion and limits items. Feel like hotel try to squeeze and save money during Covid time so how you will attract customers after?! The room is small but ok. Bed is comfy although the mattress topping is moving sideways when you get in and out of bed. Cleanliness really need to be better as I saw cockroaches on the table 🤢 (check the photo of it on this review)   The best thing in the room is the shower head 😊 hundred of small water spaying shower head does job very nice. Everything else is very basic and not up to the Ibis standard as in UK or similar hotel in Bahrain.  Would be good if there are some chair outside to sit and smoke.  The price on website is more expensive than the price on the sign outside the hotel. I booked for a week and renew another week at the reception and the person told me it same price as when I booked on website when clearly the room rate outside states lower. Try to gain money this way but in long term I don’t think anyone will come back. I met another guests and they all confirm that their room rate lower when book at reception 🤨. Nice 😒 Location wise it near Lulu supermarket so you could easy buy things but no shops or restaurants around to do at night unlike in other area of Manama where lots of outside restaurants and coffee shops.

42117,"The hotel located at the Zhuhai Center in Hengqing area, it’s the first time I stay around this new area even I been Zhuhai many times. Since this area is quite new. There have no much shops, restaurants around. So bear in mind you may only to have every meal in the hotel.   Most of the staffs are friendly and helpful that’s make their guests feel valued.  Other that that, my room is really terrible that I step on bath salt 3 times on the living room area (not inside bath room, which I think it’s glass at first!) and even I found a used syringe on the floor. I felt lucky I did not step on it.   That’s make me change all my nice experience about St. Regis brand. I never think it will happen in a 5 stars hotel.  Since I mentions my room have many of thing shouldn’t exist. So that I call the butler service to check, it’s nice to have Ms. Daisy to help on it, she is very helpful and friendly, on the second time I found the syringe. She also bring another staffs to check out my room together. To make sure there have no other unnecessary things inside my room. I am happy to have her help and feel that make the standard of the st Regis butler service. I may give another try to St. Regis Zhuhai since it’s very close to me and it’s service.",1
9499,"Complimentary water was not available— they said they ran out & wouldn’t be able to reorder until after our stay.  Laundry service wasn’t available—they said they were “in transition” for another service. No reciprocal arrangement with another hotel.  Laundromats they recommended we’re closed!  When asked how to heat the towel, they said heating couldn’t be used after April 16.  All of the above were available a few days earlier at the Hyattcentric we stayed at in Milan just two days earlier.  Very disappointing & really unacceptable from a Hyatt property!",1
54739,"this is our second visit in the SoBe You, but while our first stay in 2015 was amazing, this stay disappointed us.  It is still a great location in a nice safe neighborhood, but it has lost its soul.  The „garden“ is not maintained, the pool area was in dire need of a sweep and a clean, there is no one who protect the pads from rain or clean the breakfast chairs from rain. Check-in was unfriendly and impatient.  The bathroom was small and need renovations - as last year, but a defect toilet lid should simply be exchanged.   Last year there were David the owner, nice friendly and helpful - this year I missed him, maybe that was the reason for all this …  I’m not sure if I come back next year.  Conclusion: currently it is no longer worth a high price.",1
42437,"The thing I appreciated most about the hotel is the location in Shibuya. The staff is nice although they caused some problems with my credit card and I am still waiting for a reply from them...since the 12th of august and today it is the 28th.  ROOM: it is average, not as cramped as many rooms in Tokyo that you can get for the same price. Don't expect too much room anyway, the pictures of the rooms that I see on TA are not remotely like the one I stayed in. Mine was 10-11 square meters.   The bathroom has glass walls...which is a bit annoying if you are not alone (see attached pictures). They have blinders of course but the bathroom door didn't have any  There is a safe in the room and complimentary coffee and tea  Each floor as a theme, which I found nice.  BREAKFAST: come on!!!! seriously they call that buffet? There were 3 types of small croissants, coffee and orange juice! Plus something that I tried only once, it was something salty with yogurt I think. Get a room with no breakfast and go outside, starbucks is walking distance.",1

The rooms were fine, clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good however at the time of our stay there was construction going on non stop, starting before 7am in the morning. I spoke to staff about this three times hoping they would be able to do something about it, nothing was done. It wasn't till our departure that we realised they were expanding White Ivory and actually the construction was theirs! Not even an annoying neighbour. Unfortunately put a dampener on our stay.",1
12620,"Pros:  Reasonably close to metro - about four city blocks to de Gracia Metro.  Clean room and bathroom. Helpful staff. Reasonably priced. Cons:  Very noisy, Mallorca street is an ambulance route, bring ear plugs.  Our bathroom was supposed to be shared with one other room - instead it was shared by the whole hotel.  Very difficult to get in in the morning. We had to go to other floors to find available facilities.  (This might only be of concern to folks of a certain age, if I was younger I might not have noticed or cared.)  The bed was a horror, a double with no edge support so I felt like I was falling off all night long. There was no mirror in our room or our friends' room which struck us as odd. There is no breakfast served, not a B&B.",1
4727,"Hotel was located in a good location, near proximity to cafes, restaurants and the train station. Room was pretty small and very limited amenities.

However, the room that we stayed in was quite dated and needed some updates. The bed was comfy and a good size but the rest of the room just lacked the 4 star hotel that the downstairs showed. All in all a decent place for a quick stay over night but probably wouldn’t book for an extended stay.   Location was good for the train station and had easy access to the metro to get into the centre. We decided to walk which took about 30 mins.",1
43763,Great Location center of Fira. Close to bus stop and tour bus pickup point. Lefteris the owner was very accommodating and the best was the free pick up and drop off to and from the port or airport.  Cleanliness could be improved. Beds had long hair underneath the sheets from previous guests which were a turn off. Beds not as comfortable and WiFi was very poor. Toilet had a slight stink from the drain which wasn't very nice.

20478,"The only thing going for this hotel is location. Perfectly located for first-time visitors to NYC or for seasoned visitors like me making a theater run. But that's about it. If your room is on 8th avenue, like mine originally was, it's going to be outrageously noisy. If you're unlucky enough to encounter careless staff, as I did, you'll be moved to an ""interior"" room that's still noisy but less so than 8th avenue. If you're super unlucky, as I was, you'll end up in a visibly dirty room. My room was dirty from top to bottom -- dirty sheets, a dirty bathroom, dusty, crumbs, you name it. Just unacceptable. On top of all that it's also a really dated hotel that can't even get the basics right but wants to try to impress people with Byredo toiletries. Nope. Entirely unimpressive. For me, the damage was done.    To their credit, they tried to make it up to me but when you have half a staff that's actually good at their jobs and responsive, and another half that's careless you get an uneven and mostly negative experience. So much for being an IHG ""Platinum Elite"" member. In addition to being disgusted with the room, I just felt disrespected by this establishment. In the end I had one staffer who tried to make things right and comped my stay but honestly the damage was already done and could not adequately be rectified. I would rather have paid for an outstanding experience than have been comped for a terrible one. I can't imagine a scenario where I'd subject myself to this hotel again. ",1

66985,"The good: The shared bathrooms are clean, good for exploring Chinatown on foot but also near MRT Hua Lamphong and the Hua Lamphong railway station should you want to explore the rest of the city.   The bad: I stayed in room 133, a private room with the shared bathroom just a couple of steps away. The bed was on the floor which I initially thought was cute but eventually hated the said bed. The mattress was hard like the wooden slab it's on! It was good as lying on the floor - it's that hard. I've stayed in several hostels at this point and have even heard how Southeast Asian beds are hard but this was too extreme for me. There was also this huge wooden block inside the room which was honestly just a waste of space. It would have been nicer if they put the effort into providing a reading light or maybe a small closet instead. The staff are also a little unattentive. I don't expect them to baby me, this is a hostel after all. But there were quite a couple of times during my stay when there wasn't any staff manning the front desk. No breakfast included in the rate, so you either pay up for their café at the lobby or walk around Chinatown for something cheaper.",1
20440,"The hotel itself was clean and very nice. Staff was very friendly. Problem is the bellboys outside the hotel. I was going to get an Uber but the bellboy convinced me to take a car for more money because he was right there. All parties agreed on a price. On our way to the airport the driver (luis) said he had to charge us $30 more. I refused. My price included tolls, tips and taxes. Asked if we could pay by credit card, they said yes. Once at the airport he charged me more because of the credit card. I can only assume the bellboy’s get a cut from this. Do yourself a favour if you stay anywhere in New York and prepay your rides.

For example, I found a pubic hair in the restroom by the toilet, but I chose to just clean it myself. Some minor things but I could careless about them. However, I have to mention that their Wifi is very bad and unstable. If you plan or have to do work on your stay, this hotel will not offer that service adequately. Another thing is, the receptionist staff took so long to find my reservation as it was so simple and clear. I truly didn’t know the reason why. Lastly, the check in staff said the she “upgraded” my room to a panoramic view. However, the view was just to the street.

The check-in was already a disaster, slow, cold, disinterested, with many mistakes, assigning non-smokers to smoking chambers. Sauna was not hot, jacuzzi not so clean, soap dispenser not working..... The hotel is managed poorly and dogmatically, against any common sense, but with many inconsequential and inconsistent procedures. None of the team wanted to show ownership and assume responsibility, showing little trust and no empowerment in the team. One can see every detail why this hotel declined from a Sheraton to a Pan Pacific,  - attractive price and same hardware, but not so attractive service! ",1
31429,"Was over from the UK for a conference and decided to have a couple of days downtime.  Good location and pretty quiet rooms.Check in efficient.  Room well equiped, but a litlle small and a little dirty, hairs on bathroom floor and a few carpet stains.  No shampoo in the bathroom, no coffeee cups or shower gel. Had to ask for all of them four times before collecting myself from reception.  No on-site restaurant, on-site bar permantly closed.  No room service, no housekeeping.  They charge a daily resort/facility fee - no idea what for?   The main thing going for the place is the location. ",1
31481,"I’d imagine this was a great hotel in its hey day but now it just seems faded. Appreciate we’ve gone through a global pandemic so maintenance may have been an issue but it wasn’t explained there was no housekeeping so after a long day of sightseeing had to make the bed. Not a major issue, just annoying. Parking was $65 a day which is outrageous and if you wanted something from your car, they’d get it for you. I’d prefer to be able to get my own items from my car! No restaurant or facilities to have a meal, shower pressure was virtually non existent and the first receptionist didn’t even look up when I checked in! Check out receptionist was better but all in all I wouldn’t  recommend this hotel",1
39809,"We made the reservation and payment via agoda.com for a triple bed but at check-in was informed the room was not available. We showed them the agoda.com reservation, but the front desk was not able to help and in the end, gave us a double bed and single bed.  Wifi is terrible. Lobby and exterior looks dated but the room was modern and clean and spacious for 3 persons. Location is good and is a short walking distance to Myeongdong and Namdaemun Street Markets. Myeongdong Subway Station is in front of the hotel. Lots of local restaurants and cafes just outside the hotel plus GS25 and 7-11 convenience stores are nearby. Airport shuttle bus drop-off and pickup is 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel, across the street from the hotel. Hotel is located off the main street and is therefore quiet.",1
9403,"Overall, Loews Miami Beach was a good hotel for a young couple wanting to be around the action. We stayed a Thursday - Sunday in May 2023 but we would probably not stay again.   Pros: Location - centrally located in Miami Beach and walking distance to Ocean Drive/restaurants/bars/shops. Beach Access - complimentary beach chairs that are guaranteed, nice not having to fight for a chair early in the morning. Quiet - never noticed disruptions from other rooms/loud talking or music especially at night. Check-In & Out process easy - can do it online/mobile phone.  Cons: Room Cleanliness - the room didn't seem super clean upon arrival, the bathroom had rust on the appliances and it looked like the shower/sink had barely been wiped down, the rug under the bed also didn't look vacuumed after the previous guests. Beach Umbrella - extra cost to use w/ chairs. Price - Considering the room was not super clean and we only received turn down service 1 out of 3 days, the price didn't seem fair.",1
55929,"I've never been one to post reviews, but after being scammed by one of its staff members, I know feel compelled in this case. Riadh Palms Spa and resort You'll probably be approached by your rep offering you excursions on the first morning of your stay. I must urge you to be aware of a man named Wahid that will approach you on your first morning of your stay as well, offering you a service at 70 dinar, where he will take you around the mosque and markets of old medina, keeping you safe from scammers and criminal activities in the town. It started off fine as he picked us up with an unknown driver in a old black Peugeot 206. His catch phrases of 'luvly jubbly' 'cheap as chips' and 'asda price' were comical. He took us to the mosque, guided us around and took our photos. Everything fine till this point. We told him we wanted to go to souvenir shops for small things, ie fridge magnets, camel dolls and football shirts, (yes I know there fake). He kept on bypassing the shops we were interested in and lured us to a shop that had very little souvenirs at the front(smokescreen). He was very pushy and persistent in taking us further into the shop. I could see they sold carpets and small rugs. I told him we weren't interested in buying carpets, but was still very pushy and insisted on taking us further in, as not to offend him. We started to look around, and as we were looking, a small old lady greeted my wife and shown her the traditional rug making process with a loom. We were then lead to the back of the shop, sat down on a sofa, offered mint tea that I forced down to not affend the owner ""the boss"" that was large built and intimidating. Another man quite old started rolling out carpets in front of us, were I instantly knew it was a sales pitch. But it was an aggressive sales pitch! The old guy had rolled about 20 small rugs out in quick succession. He looked like he'd just done 100 push ups after it! I said I maybe interested in buying one small 50cm x 50cm rug that was embroided with my sons name in arabic. The owner ""the boss"" ( I couldn't remember his name) wouldn't give me a price for this and said we give them away for free. I knew I couldn't get out of this room without buying a proper carpet from them. I did want to leave as things were getting tense, as they could sense I didnt want to buy carpets, but Wahid was staring at me with a stern look on his face smoking away, and every time I tried to discuss with my wife the boss would put his face close to mine clicking his fingers saying 'hello' 'hello' 'hello'. Everytime I looked serious, the boss would put his hand on my shoulder, and tell me to 'relax' 'your on holiday' 'we just want you to be happy' again very intimidating. I kept on asking for the price but all I got was 'good price' 'special price'  When they finally presented the price, they made us believe that we had already agreed to buying, which we didn't as the boss was already filling out the invoice book, so I knew I wasn't getting out this. It was getting hostile as the boss and the old guy were shouting at each other when I said I couldnt afford to buy many rugs. I kept on asking for the price, but all I got was 'good price' 'special price' They also made us feel as if we had wasted there time buy not wanting to buy what they intended to sell. I was getting so stressed I agreed to buy 3 rugs just to get out of there, but the boss would only let me buy 3 rugs with another 2 dor free of charge (I know it doesn't make sense). This came to 1,100 dinars (just under £300). When I was allowed to stand up again, I was told to pay the old guy 20 dinars for his role in the scam. As soon as we got out of the shop, wahid kept on telling me 'my boss needs to know' over and over. I told him I didn't have that amount on me, so he promptly marched me to the nearby cashpoint. I tried to freeze my cards but I had no WiFi or roaming data. My first card was denied the transaction, I was relieved but his eyes lit up when my second card was successful. He instantly snatched the money from the machine. I might have well had a gun held to my back during this process. He had no interest in showing us to any other shops after he scammed us for his commission. We were picked up in the old Peugeot again and taken back to our hotel, where he demanded 50 dinars as a tip. I asked for a copy of the receipt and he asked if i had a problem, i just said no i just need a receipt thats all. All I eventually got was small slip of paper saying Tapis and the amount. I'm not sure what arrangement he has with the hotel as I could see him hanging round chatting to door and reception staff all week and harrasing other guests, mainly from the Uk. I was so angry I had to make a complaint to love holiday and the hotel. I regret doing this now as they reported this to the hotel, and the hotel told wahid. Wahid confronted me after hearing of this,asking what my problem was, I told him I wasn't happy with the aggressive sales tactic that was put on to me, and that I'm on holiday to avoid stress like this. He wasnt interested. I tried to walk away but he intended to follow me until he abruptly told me to sit down and talk. He then took a pen and paper and told me to sign this peice of paper wavering him of any wrong doing in this matter. I was being stared at with arms folded crossed by another staff member while this was going on. Felt like I was in the shop again. I decided not to mention anything again to anyone until I arrived back home as I couldn't trust anyone again. Wahid also pestered another couple from the UK, that arrived on the same day as us, in fact 4 times in one day Fortunately for them they turned him down. We understand that Wahid works for the hotel, and has a useful role in protecting tourists from the dangers of scams and criminal activities outside the hotel. But for him to be the one performing the scam is very wrong. He seems to be a local gangster that the locals fear, as he was throwing his wait around the only shop we were allowed to go into, bullying the shopkeeper to sell a football  shirt at his price.  Whenever I bumped in to him I was nervous that he would try and swindle us out of more money, with jewellery for sale. We have never felt so scared and intimidated in our lives whilst on holiday. Don't trust any reps or organisers, as they are all in on it. It was the so called Love Holidays rep that alerts you of all the dangers outside the hotel at first making you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable, so wahid can step in offering you his service. Infact my experience of Tunisia is a place that just wants to rinse you dry of all your hard earned cash. You'll never get the real price for anything, as everything is inflated by 4x as much for UK residents.",1

60178,"Our first time in Langham Shenzhen cos we joined other family as a group. We used to stay in hotels in Conventional center. It is a bit away from the city center. We need 10 to 15 mins walk from the metro to the hotel. Check in is quick and efficient. We all been upgraded to higher floor and offered with early check in and late check out. Staffs are nice and attentive. However, they need to pay more attention to the doorman. I always saw them playing with the smart phone when they are on duty. Room is clean and cozy. I didn't like the main switch of room. It did not work sometime. It is kind of weird and I needed to switch on the light one by one. Facilities is good. They have indoor and our door swimming pool. There is a small scale Mall just adjacent to the hotel. We can shop and eat in a short distance. There are  underground shops on the way to the metro station. There are variety of restaurants there.for a short stay,  overall experience is good.",1

It is in an an excellent location near to Gaudi exhibition centre, restaurantsand la rambla- however as newbies to Barcelona we didn't realise this until our last day and when we asked the receptionist for some advice on our first evening about which museums we should see or what restaurants she didn't tell us any of this information about its excellent location within 5 mins of everything!!! frustrating, also the coffee machines were broken and the pole that held our curtain broke and when reported no one came to fix it.

10932,"Total bait and switch! Pictures show a great hotel, but it’s two stars at best. Rooms were small and old. No coffee maker in the room, staff were curt and unfriendly. You get the feeling that they have a lot of once only international guests, so they didn’t have to be nice.   Hallways upstairs when we got out he the elevator were actually scary. It looked like something from “The Shining”. Another lady we met in the elevator said the same thing- unprompted.   Rooms are small and cramped (even by NYC standards) with terrible fluorescent lighting -  Bathroom was tiny and dated.  Redeeming qualities - bed was comfortable, shower was hot and with good pressure, and it was surprisingly quiet on the 28th floor considering it’s across the street from Penn Station.   I would not go back. Pick another hotel.   Oh, they also nickel and dime you. Resort fee is $30. Luggage storage $5. Coffee machine if you wanted one is $50 per night!",1

About a 8 minute wait.)  I rounded down instead of up because wifi also needed to be reconnected to every time I shut down my phone or laptop.",1
16897,The Hotel is situated close to red light district and a distance away from the main shopping and tourist attractions. The rooms are standard for Japanese hotel. The restaurant and bar over priced! 800 yen for a beer. The hotel has a pool but cost extra. All in all average hotel,1
58091,"One of the female staff who did our check in was extremely unfriendly. Even non starred hotel or hostel can offer better services than this so called ‘5 star’ hotel… Before booking our accommodation in Prague, I came across some recent negative feedback on Google Reviews against this hotel particularly highlighting its poor services but I still went ahead with the booking for its central location, competitive rates and the ‘5 star’ title, hoping that we wouldn’t confront with unfriendly staff. However, unluckily, the check-in service was so poor. I genuinely think that a staff with such a bad, cold and unfriendly attitude shouldn’t be working in hospitality industry because clearly she’s not enjoying her job and all she does is just to ruin other people’s holidays! I badly regret booking our stay here. Do NOT stay at this hotel unless you want to experience a hotel where the lobby staff behaves like she’s the boss and you’re her servant.",1

Room was set to 25C when I arrived, but air con was quick to adjust to a more comfortable temperature. Decent nights sleep, thanks in part to the black out curtains.

46867,"We visited the hotel for a 2-night stay in May as part of a school trip, with expectations based on the specific brand of the hotel chain. Our overall experience was disappointing. Here are the details:  - Upon arrival (at 16:00), 20 rooms were not ready. - The buffet, which was supposed to be ready by 16:00, was not ready until 16:20. - The quality of the buffet was low. - The cleanliness of the room was insufficient, with salt stains on surfaces, a rusty siphon in the bathroom, an unpleasant smell on the bed, and drops of soft drink on the floor. - Our breakfast was served in a separate room, which is understandable as the children would disturb other guests. However, the variety and quality of the breakfast were low, especially compared to the breakfast provided to other guests on the 9th floor. A visit and photographic evidence available to the hotel confirm this. - There was only one staff member serving approximately 60 people during breakfast. Despite the person's diligent efforts, they couldn't do anything other than clean the tables. - There was no possibility to order additional coffee except the one from the machine, even with an extra charge. - The window in the room couldn't be opened or even tilted, resulting in poor ventilation. The air conditioning had to be constantly running. - There is a cracked glass on the ceiling of the atrium, directly above the heads of the guests. It seems that no one has noticed it yet, despite it being a potential danger to the guests' safety.  It seems that the school guests are being treated as second-class customers.",1

Another male receptionist was engaged on the phone and later left the counter, leaving the poor lady to manage all those in queue.  When I opened the door, was greeted by a view which is facing rooms of others. Nice decor are just on the outside, room is just average, with a bit back dated things in the room.

There is a McDonald's next door for late night snacks.  The hotel is modern and check in was easy and friendly.  The room was compact and the bed really comfortable.  The shower was good and the air conditioning a welcome addition.  The hotel was quite busy due to the event so it was difficult to find anywhere to sit on the three mornings we were there.  There breakfast ingredients were also in short supply, again due to demand, but staff worked hard to keep it topped up.  The toasters were rubbish and everyone moaned as they stood around waiting every day only to receive warm bread.  I would stay again if visiting the o2 due to close location and convenience.  I would skip the breakfast though.",1
58021,"Whenever I was in Osaka, I always picked to stay at St. Regis at Honmachi ever since it opens its doors.  I therefore had stayed there not less than half a dozen time and based on past experience I was always quite contend.  My parents decided to go to Osaka for hanami this April, what’s been called as the last sakura hanami of the Heisei era.  I took my parents to stay at St. Regis Osaka and because of the high season demands, my three-nights stay at St. Regis comes to a total of approximately JPY300,000 without breakfast and based on members’ rate for a standard deluxe room.  Putting the cost aside, I would expect good service from a hotel like St. Regis and it had never failed me before.  However, I was proven wrong to take my parents there as there were quite a number of hiccups during our recent stay.  They weren’t even able to locate my reservation upon my arrival when I gave them my name, turned out that they got the wrong registered name.  Separately, in my room, the toiletry I was given included one shampoo and two conditioner in the bathtub.  No shower gel was provided and the housekeeping didn’t seem to notice the issue at all during my entire stay!  Secondly, no laundry bags were given in the room, neither were the laundry forms.  I called the butler and she sent me two plastic laundry bags without the forms.  The back-and-Firth of such simple task took 25 minutes to be sorted out.  I placed the laundry, the form and the shoes to be shined in the butler box at around 10:30 p.m. and called the butler for pick-up but was surprised that no one picked up from the butler box after 11 hours!  There were more to my chaotic experience, on one occasion, there were no clean earphones to be used in one morning at the gym, and even if there were at other times, when I tried to put the disposable ear plug foams on, they were literally rotten and melt on my fingers the moment I picked them up from the bin placed in the drawer, it was really disgusting.  There was also one occasion that my parents’ room wasn’t being made up and cleaned for the entire day and they definitely had the “Do Not Disturb” sign turned-off!  As an apology, my parents were given a fruit bowl, but honestly who cares?!  We were there looking for some reasonable services from a five-stars hotel but we were truly let down.  We weren’t looking for compensation but just hope that they could do their job better in the first place.  Finally on my check-out day, I wasn’t able to extend the checkout time as the hotel was fully booked and my flights wasn’t leaving until 18:00.  All that was well understood but I had left some bottles of sake with the hotel’s refrigerator and I indicated to the concierge and the receptionist that I would returned to the hotel at 15:00 and get the bottles from their refrigerator and put them in my suitcase at that time.  Instead of creating a scene at the lobby, the receptionist said I could do the repacking on the 11th Floor, one is the banquet rooms.  I returned to the hotel punctually at 15:00 and gave them the luggage retrieving slip and asked them to have the pieces delivered onto the 11th Floor, I waited for 23 minutes before the retrieved luggage arrived, and yet there were still some pieces missing!  The whole thing was so unorganised and chaotic and put me in a deep stress as I needed to run to the airport.  After the saga, I finally finished repacking and left the hotel at 15:45.  I don’t know what happened to St. Regis as there seem to be short of staff (perhaps all experienced staff left for Conrad?) and a lot the existing ones lack proper training.  It is kind of surprising that this could happen in Japan, a country that is so well-known for hospitality.  Anyway, I will not go back to St. Regis Osaka anymore for my future stay.",1

Also upon arrival- we paid 9 euro in tax then had to pay another £33 pound to cover the cost of the mini bar that we were unaware of (even though we didn’t use this). On check out we were advised this can take 1-3 business days to go back in! Slightly annoying when we didn’t use the mini bar- and if it doesn’t go back in we are no longer face to face to enquire about it. The hotel is very Close to a shopping centre that’s across the road with a Tesco inside and other food places. McDonald’s is right next door. Use Uber for travel- To the airport it was £18-24 and to market square was £4-6. Reception staff were very friendly! We did not have food at the hotel.",1

When we asked for conditioner we were told That it was not not included with our rate. The same goes with coffee. There was a Nespresso machine in the room but no pods.

The guesthouse is located on the first floor of a multi-story building. There was a lovely smell as soon as you entered the building and the guesthouse itself was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was good, complimentary hot drinks were available all day and a selection of drinks and snacks available to purchase for a small fee. There was also a nice outside terrace area and complimentary wi-fi and computers. The location is good, about a 10 minute walk from the nearest bus tour stop and metro stations nearby. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would recommend this guesthouse. The only downside was the fact that we were in room 1 which is next door to the bathroom for other guests to use and so had to put up with the noise (and smells) whenever it was in use.",1

Walls were thin however and door was a bit hard to floor. Flat sceen tv, air conditioning, and wifi were great. Balcony was shared with neighbouring room. Pool was shared with all rooms and had a gorgeous view. Location and view of Caldera was unreal. We arranged a drive to the airport for 20 euro fee. Nikos at reception is there to help you with anything you need, he had someone bring us an atv we wanted to rent, he gave us complimentary drinks on our balcony, gave us much advice where to visit. He was an excellent host. The young man who helped us with our bags was also very friendly and willing to help. Would definitely recommend Prekas apartments!!",1
65,"I've stayed here twice, the previous time was in September 2015, just after the current owners took over the hotel. Frankly it's starting to look a bit tired: lots of chipped furniture, surfaces damaged by hot drinks and food - these are small things that could be fixed fairly easily.  Housekeeping needs to be better - the paintwork and light switch plates were grubby (just wipe them down already!), and one day we found a hair (not ours) in the bed, left behind by housekeeping.  When our toilet roll was running low, the housekeeper didn't leave a new one, we had to request it from reception. Two of the plug sockets were not working (one of them was hanging out from the base).  There's a safe in the room but you have to pay to use it.  There is no fridge, which would be a welcome addition for our bottles of water in the city in the hot weather.  The bath towels are on the small side.  When we made our booking (over 7 months before we travelled), we requested a higher floor.  We were given a room on what Brits call the first floor, and Americans call the second floor - the one above the ground in other words.  And why is there only one chair in a King Room?  And quite a hard chair at that.  Two people = two chairs please.  The good points: the room is a fair size by New York standards, and the price is reasonable.  There's always plenty of hot water, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Although some noise carried in from the corridor, the external noise was not bad at all, despite the low floor (we were at the back of the hotel, overlooking Chrystie Street).  There is no breakfast at the hotel.  Our favourite local diner had closed down, so we used a deli a few blocks along Canal that does good take out breakfast items.  There are also a few coffee shops not too far away.  The location worked for us, we're regular visitors to the city and prefer not to stay in the busy midtown area.  It is a long way downtown though, so may not be to everyone's liking.",1
19050,I spent a night at this hotel in February 2022. I lost a pair of very expensive hearing aids.....3 emails later there is no response. Maybe they didn't fond them but it would be nice to know that they looked for them.,1
31362,"We stayed at the Lykia world resort 10 years ago when it was most definitely a 5 star resort with beautiful grounds and great service. We were excited to go back with our now 18 and 15 year old daughters and honestly wish were very disappointed. Firstly the good things, the weather was perfect, the main pool is really lovely, the slides are good fun and our accomodation was great. We stayed in room 2220 which was a prestige room with gorgeous sea views and was a duplex room with a big lounge and toilet on the ground floor and upstairs 3 bedrooms each with its own en suite .. perfect for our family. The entertainment team are also lovely with a special mention to Olga who ran the aqua fit class every day with such enthusiasm and took the time to speak to everyone. Now the issues... the male staff were terrible with our 18 year old following her to toilets to.get her phone number, sitting on her sunlounger to harass her about going on a date with them. The most disgusting was the entertainments manager who made her feel most uncomfortable asking her repeatedly for a date and that he genuinely really liked her, it honestly gave us all the creeps so we spent our holiday trying to avoid him. The staff In general are very rude, trying to get a drink is a nightmare, they only know how to do 2 cocktails, pina colada and mojito, so if you like just those you'll be OK but ask for anything else they just pretend to not know what you want and give the impression that you are wasting their time. Several times I was queuing and they will serve the men behind you first and ignore you. It's mainly Russian and Turkish here and really don't cater for the British at all. The restaurant and bars are swarming with flies. To the extent that the salads are a real no go, you go to take the spoon to take some salad and at least 10 flies will fly out of that bowl it really puts you off eating. The other food around was always luke warm at best and it is a fighting frenzy to get some as the other guests will push in front of you with no manners. The hotel is completely isolated with no shops or town to wander out to escape the hotel for a bit. There is one shop in the hotel selling inflatables which our girls wanted with the most ridiculous prices!!! An exact rubber ring which I found on asda for £6 was 38 euros in there!! The owner told me all prices had gone up and there was nothing he could do. We spent 50 euros on a small lilo and a rubber ring and felt completely ripped off. For that reason there are not many people around the pool with inflatables or top tip would be take your own from home. Lastly the endless noise.... this is the only holiday I have gone on where I needed earplugs every night. They have a nightclub down by the beach called party centre where they start playing music with the bass turned up to max so all you can hear is boom boom boom from around 9.30pm until midnight. I phoned down to reception at 11.45pm on the second night to ask when the music will stop to be laughed at and told ""around another hour"". This was every single night of our holiday. We are not the type of family who go to bed super early but relentless loud music every night until midnight or beyond was too much. This was once a real luxury feel resort with great weather to match it and it has had several years of neglect. The grounds are awful now with overgrown bushes, not great for photos. It's a real shame and because of this experience I would not holiday here again.",1
63236,"It was with much anticipation that we had booked the hotel for our family holiday.  Everything was fully confirmed on booking.com, a few emails were also exchanged with management for other needed information. But suddenly after a week of booking the rooms, received notification that Damac had cancelled the the booking! No reason given, no email and no apologies.   Truly appalling behavior, extremely unprofessional. ",1
19063,"Didn't really love anything about this hotel and I'm a Marriott gold elite.  There was only one elevator working and there was a huge tour group staying at the hotel.  The rooms were so, so hot.  There was a ton of construction going on just outside the hotel.   Champs E'lysee is crowded and crazy.  I will not be staying here next time I am in Paris.  ",1
61050,"Pros: Good hotel especially for the price.  Relatively quiet despite being on busy thoroughfare because it's tucked back.  Rooms are clean, good for business and internet was fast.  Ample, well-lit parking.  Breakfast is the normal reduced fare during these covid times.  Cons: TV was stuck on one channel (I don't really watch TV anyway so didn't bother), the hotel is difficult to find especially at night because of no monument signage, and morning desk was a little snooty, something I'm not accustomed to.  However afternoon and evening were very accommodating.",1
43503,"I’m not sure about all these fantastic reviews here. Did they stay in the same hotel I stayed? Ok, the hotel is not terrible, but it is definitely not what one would expect from a Kempinski brand.  Especially in Asia, where one anticipates better than average experiences from all brands, this came as a surprise.  First the pros: •	Beautiful surroundings •	Nice view •	Very large rooms •	Good service  Then the cons: •	The hotel is very dated. The furniture looks like that it has not been updated for 20+ years.  Just looking at the furniture, you’d think you are in a fleabag hotel, not in a Kempinski. It’s such an easy fix, I wonder why the hotel or Kempinski hasn’t simply replaced the furniture. •	The bed looks saggy and was never crisply made the whole time we were there.   •	The shower floor, though marble, is perfectly leveled. That means water sits on the base and does not drain completely. Daily housekeeping also does not help drain/dry the shower base, so wet smell develops.  •	Very nice jogging trail by the lake in the beautiful hotel garden (again, no complains about the surroundings). But the gate to the trail around the lake was locked, so only the 1/4 mile trail in the hotel garden was accessible.  •	Lastly, the hotel is far away from any nearby shops, restaurants, cafes.  No coffee machine in room.  So if one wants coffee, the choices are: 1) take a taxi for 10 minutes to a shopping area nearby, or 2) have $10 coffee in the lobby bar.  The coffee in the lobby was actually very good. The pastry was also fantastic.   If I hadn’t had great expectations, I probably would have given it a 3 star (average) review. But I was disappointed and surprised with this particular Kempinski, hence a 2 star.",1
50137,"The Filipino staff were very accommodating and friendly. They gave us tips on what to do, where to eat, and patiently gave us directions to nearby places. The hotel is near Neon Night Market, a lively night market with a varied selection of food and shops. Location is accessible and is near the shopping malls, convenience stores, thai massage spas, and just a 10-min walk to the train station. We got the quadruple room which was perfect if you're travelling with friends or family. It was very spacious and wifi was fast.They also have a rooftop bar with a great view of the city.",1
6654,"A good place to stay, Good staff. Just wish that the morning newspapers would be delivered to my door. I was on crutches for the stay.     The room was not hoovered every time it was cleaned. I loved the discount I got for a long stay.  Shame the pool wasn't in operation.  Also,the picture on Foxtel channels wasn't the best.   The biggest bug bear was the thinness of the toilet paper. Use a 3 ply brand in future guys.      Gee, the mini fridge was so small.  Overall very happy though. It was a 2 week stay. ",1
23030,"I wrote this long review for you to take into consideration and actually something about it. All in all i  rank this hotel a 2 out of 10..just for the slides although the pool is not that clean not to mention the pools of the slides.. veeery dirty🤢🤢. The room is quite basic or I'd rather say below basic. The food is utterly disgusting.. You feel that you're eating plastic.. Breakfast is nightmarish i left the restaurant very hungry. And to crown the whole i  found a bug in my cereals that gave me the creeps. i didn't even bother tell them about it coz it was abvious that i would be ignored till the moon and back. So meh 🤷‍♂️. Just if you're willing to pay and never eat there and you don't mind a bad room!, you can go, otherwise run for the hills. Ps the all inclusive thing is the joke of the century.. you feel that the lemonade is made of powder and the water in them is that of A well or sth. The coke is like water and sugar combined nothing else. As if you're drinking medicine. 🤢. I would like to genuinely ask you.. Whyyyyyyy? Oh i forgot the lady of the room service.. I put a do no disturb sign and oh honey she  flipped it to ""please clean the room"" and violate your privacy with or without your approval.. And would later argue with you about it and made you feel that you're crazy.. Ps she did the same thing to my friend in the other room.",1
33611,"Having stayed in a number of hotels in Gotanda & read the reviews I was looking forward to my stay in the hotel especially as I really enjoy this area with its many restaurants. Located close to the JR station and subway is an advantage but also means I was kept awake by train noise late into the evening. Also, although I’m used to firm mattresses in Japan this was firmer than most and the hotel could not provide me with a thin mattress often available in other hotels. I suggest asking for a room where you can’t see the railway tracks. ",1

1336,"When we first arrived, we were informed that we could check in earlier as they happened to have a room ready, only on the condition that we write a review for Hotel PJ Myeongdong on trip advisor. Needless to say, at that point in time, we didn’t have enough information about the hotel except for the polite staff managing the check in counter. However, things weren’t as expected over the next couple of days.  IMPT NOTES TO TRAVELLERS: 1. Getting to the hotel wasn’t as convenient as what the reviews have pointed out. The hotel was located in a secluded area, and you have to walk along a dimly-lit stretch of road adjacent to a construction site, before getting to the nearest side gate. For their own safety, I would strongly recommend female travellers/solo travellers against staying at this hotel. Furthermore, the frequency of the shuttle bus to Myeongdong is once every hour, so it isn’t a feasible means of transportation especially for travellers who miss the bus.  2. There was a signage at the side gates, clearly stating that the gates will be closed after midnight. We hence made an effort to arrive at the side gates by 10ish, expecting the gates to be open. On the first night, this worked out well as the side gate was opened when we arrived around 10.15pm. However, to our dismay, the gate was closed the next night when we arrived at around the same timing. When the security guard spotted us, he immediately turned off the lights. After many attempts to catch his attention, he reluctantly walked over and made gestures that we couldn’t comprehend due to our language barrier. We asked to speak to his manager, who apologised and said that the signage was wrong and that they close the side gates at 10pm. He also mentioned that they will change the signs immediately. Needless to say, upon checking out the next day, the signage still stayed midnight when we checked it. So please don’t be misled like us, and reach the gates before 10pm otherwise you’d be stranded at the dark alley next to the construction site.  On a positive note, we really appreciate the professionalism of the manager who came down to the side gate to direct us to walk to the main gate, and met us at the lobby on the second level to explain about the closing hours of the side gate and apologise for the inconvenience. However, we are still really puzzled by the universal common understanding of “midnight”, and will appreciate if this could be made clearer in the future to ensure the safety of travellers, which I believe is a priority to the hotel.",1
40192,"We found the location of Ambelia Suites convenient to OIA.  There were many fine restaurants nearby and the village was lovely.  Unfortunately, our rooms smelled strongly of mildew and mold. This became quite unpleasant and kept us out of the room whenever possible.  The rooms were clean, however the kitchen and bathroom lacked the basics and were not as clean as we would expect.  The fan in one of our rooms did not work and as a result there was little to no air circulating.",1
6391,"Our first stay at Novotel Darling Harbour after staying at Novotel Darling Square several times.  Handy location with the L1 station adjacent and plenty of eating and drinking choices a short walk away.  Check in staff were excellent.  Our room had a wonderful view of Darling Harbour and was nice and quiet. The bedding was comfortable.   Unfortunately our air con was faulty and offered little control except cold or cold. It remained off and eventually the room warmed up. Staff tried hard to help, but no maintenance people were available and they could not offer a similar room.  The annoying thing about the room was the baffling and finicky light switching. I'm sure the designers thought it was modern and a good idea at the time, but  it is awful.  Good bathroom lighting once you worked out   how and where to turn them on.   The room was very clean.  The shower recess is small and the shower mount has only one position which fires the water at the opposite side of the recess. For a shorter person it fires straight at one's head.  The breakfast buffet was excellent. Plenty of choices, nicely spaced seating and very nice staff at the buffet desk.  We appreciated the hotel's staff wearing face masks in the vast majority of times we observed them.   The pool is outdoors and cold. The tennis court appears to have suffered during Sydney's big wet and is not in particularly good condition.  A good establishment let down but some maintenance and design issues.",1

21429,"We booked a double kitchen suite (myself, husband and 2 adult ""children"") 10 months before arrival. We arrived to be given the smallest room with no kitchen which was also very dirty.. After speaking to reception we were told we had been given the wrong room and would be moved the next day. The next morning before we left the room we were told by the maid that the hotel is going down and that the new room we would be given would probably be really bad. She was right, yes the room was considerably bigger but so dirty, especially the bathroom. Human hair was on the bathroom floor, in the shower/bath, on the toilet flush, in the bathroom sink and also in one of the beds. Plus a large amount of dust/dirt. After complaining to reception we were told the room would be cleaned thoroughly the next day. Granted it was slightly but still wasn't to an acceptable standard.  A lift we used had a used tampon on the floor and overall the hotel was very unpleasant.  The ""hotel"" seems to focus more on the asylum seekers that occupy the lower part. Overall, PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. The pictures shown on the website are very misleading. You will be very disappointed and it could even spoil your time in New York which would be a shame as the city is amazing. ",1

20914,"First trip out of town after two years and we were booked at Citadines Bay Manila for 2 nights.  It's an offshoot hotel under the Ascott brand and well, being an Ascott, you expect a certain air of quality.  The hotel is situated near many food stops and malls, so boredom shouldn't be an issue if you bring along the family.  Being an Ascott, they did not disappoint.  Quality of service, excellent.  Quality of personnel, excellent.  Quality of facilities, borderline excellent.  TV channels aree limited to local selections only which was a bit disappointing.   But overall, it was all good so far.  Until ..... housekeeping forgot about room.  I had to attend to a conference in the morning and my wife went out a bit.  We met after lunch  back in the room which wasn't still attended to by housekeeping.  I thought it was because we forgot to press the little maid button and since we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon outside, we left the room as is thinking that housekeeping would come around a little later.  But when we came back around 6 PM, the room wasn't still attended to.  We were too tired to call and ask and then leave again for them to come fix up a little so we decided to let it be.  I guess the saving grace are the rest of the staff.  Their attention cannot be overemphasized.  Will we come back.  Of course.  Hopefully housekeeping won't forget about us next time.",1

Of course we don't' fall for the trap of buying more and i would say to anyone when they promise a hour get up and leave after a hour.

5657,"Initially booked a double room at Nessebar Beach Hodel, which is from the same hotel group as Burgas Beach. Due the Covid situation, we were announced that the Nessebar Beach will not be open for the 2020 summer season, and we were redirected with the booking at Burgas Beach hotel at the same price and receiving the same package. We booked a Double Room with sea view and received a Double Room park view. When we talked at the reception desk, they told us that the Nessebar Beach hotel does not actually has a sea view, as the view is blocked by a sand dune and we have to be glad that we  received an upgrade from a 3 star to a 4 star hotel.  Here is a short list of ""all the good"" things this ""4 star"" hotel offers: • 4 elevators badly sincronized for 19 floors (1st floor is actually the reception and lobby and the 2nd floor is the restaurant and bar). Waiting time during meal hours can go up to 30 min when you want to go from 1st floor to your room. The guest are pressing all the buttons - up and down - regardless of where they really want to go and when you tell the staff about this they do nothig. Some elevators have issues and out of a sudden, some floor buttons go red as if you pressed them. • Room cleaning - The bed was clean and we had clean towels. The furniture had dust on it. The towels were changed every day, but the bed sheets and pillow covers were never changed during our stay ( 5 nights ). The dust was growing while the days passed by, as no one was cleaning the furniture. We had to clean the dust from the furniture pices we wanted to use. • Bad bathroom ventilation, or to be more correctly, no ventilation in the bathroom. There was a ventilator mounted on the ceiling but just for design i guess. • 3 bars - one in lobby, which was closed, one on 2nd floor and one at the pool. The 2nd floor bar was open from 15:00 to 23:00, while the pool bar was from 10:00 to 17:00. This means that if you want something to drink before 15:00 you were forced to walk to the bar pool, even if you wanted just to stay in the lobby to enjoy the drink. • Snack bar - between 11:00 till 15:00. This was the first time an All inclusive package a Bulgarian hotel had only 1 snack bar timeframe and it was overlapping with the lunch ( 12:00 to 14:00 ). They only serve sandwiches and hotdogs. The offered icecream from 11:00 to 17:00, but after 2 hours, the icecream was just a cream.",1

19140,"This was our second visit to this hotel and hence my second review. We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights about 3 years back during our marriage anniversary and had a mixed feeling – while we were satisfied with the room quality and location, we felt that service was below what one would expect from a true 5-star property.  We wanted to give another chance this time and booked a Junior Suite for a 3-night stay. I also wrote to the hotel about our preference about a city-facing suit well in advance. We reached the hotel a bit late in the evening. Upon reaching our room on the 5th floor, we realized that we were given a room facing the rear side of the property – facing not-so-good-looking structures, plant room of a neighbouring property and certainly not what we were expecting. The room, although having a cramped balcony, was not how a junior suite would look like. It was at a corner of the wing, oblique shaped, a small sofa placed just outside of the entry of the washroom. Next morning, we realized that there was not ample day light even if we ignore the unpleasant view. In our previous trip, we stayed in an architectural room with full-length glass on one side, enabling pleasant city view with ample sun light.  Immediately upon checking in, I called up the front desk about changing our room to a city facing one and the lady replied back saying that there was no other suite available and she would try the following day. Later we discovered that the washroom was not cleaned properly and the light placed inside the cupboard did not go off as it was directly facing our face while lying down for sleep. Immediately, I wrote to the hotel and informed them about the inconvenience and requested to change the room. Next morning, the manager approached and tried to allay my concern about the room being a proper junior suite and due to full occupancy, they were unable to change etc etc, assuring that the other issues would be addressed on priority. On our return to our room that evening, we noticed that the light fixture was not repaired. We were tired and decided to put up a towel between the cupboard doors, blocking the light somehow.  Next morning, again I checked with the front desk if they could arrange a change of room and requested if they could at least arrange an architectural room (a downgrade from Junior suite). In reply, I was told that there was one room available and they just gave it to someone who checked in early that morning. It was clearly evident that all they were telling me since checking in were merely lip service. We really became sick and tired of checking with them about the room and gave up finally.  Now if this was not all, there were comedy of errors in the service. One late evening, we asked the house keeping to help us open a wine bottle. One staff came, took the bottle and didn’t appear for a good 40-45 minutes. We again called up the housekeeping and one lady came with a cork opener. I was amused and explained to her that her colleague took a bottle and if she could check if the same can be opened and given back. After waiting for half an hour, I gave up and went to sleep.  Amidst all these disappointments, I must say that the staff at the breakfast were amazing and helped us during more than one occasion on taking customized orders, while putting up smiling faces. In comparison to our last trip, this was a pleasant change and we truly appreciate.  Overall, the location is all this hotel offers. The rooms are showing signs of wear and looked jaded as compared to our last visit or could be it was the room where we stayed. After spending top dollars for a junior suite, the experience has left us wondering whether it was worth staying there for a second time. It was disappointing no doubt but it also took a lot of time to fix issues that one would not expect in a five-star hotel. Given our past experience in the likes of Paris Shangri-la, I strongly feel that a couple of hundred dollars extra would be worth paying if one wants to enjoy a true five-star experience.",1
27183,"Booked thru Amex FHR and was expecting this stay since it's a FHR hotel. Arrived late around 11:00 pm and got an upgrade but I found that I got upgraded to a corner room with even smaller space. The hotel was full and it is understandable but the front desk staff had no smile or service at all. One thing I found out is that some floors have l'occitane products for showering and on that day I got some "" shangri-la"" branded showering products. Not sure whether this is hotel policy or discrimination on OTA bookers. Wouldn't recommend to book this hotel if it is full because definitely the service is well below average when they are busy.",1

The bathroom was tiny, and the shower was terrible. The shower had no water pressure, and every time I turned the temperature higher, the pipes made a ton of noise.  I felt terrible for my neighbor, but not bad enough to take a cold shower!  I won't stay here again.  Next time, I'd definitely pay a little more at stay at the JW Marriott across the street.

We were sent outside to a Covid testing centre, which had no availability- and found another after visits to a travel agent and another test centre.  We found out later that the hotel arranges Covid tests for guests (in room) - but the desk staff on duty for us, didn’t know it.  We had to travel to Maroussi for a test.  Ten min waits at front desk for service from the 2 behind the counter.  Advise being on non-Acropolis side if you want a quiet room.  The thick glass doesn’t stop siren or motorcycle noise on the Acropolis side.  To Hilton mgmt: please do not write a response.",1
31659,"Overall a great stay. It was going thru a remodel, so during the day there was some construction noise. They stopped working in the early afternoon so it was quite in the everything. It's far enough off of 183 and 45 so you don't get any of the highway road noise.",1
8476,Economical hotel. I believe there is a free shuttle bus to Disney world from the hotel.   there is also a cheap but tasty sushi restaurant at the first floor of the hotel.. a very nice hotel afterall!!!,1
7181,"So, where to begin, we arrived and nice receptionist welcomed us and gave us our key and entry and wifi passes. Aaand thats it for nice stuff. First bad thing was staircase, very narrow, circular and steep. I have 90kg and workout and i barely could cary myself and my gym size bag which was in front of me, upstairs. Second thing, the smell of hotel...something sweet, sour and undefined and unpleasent. No vents and no windows. Room 514 was ok, bed ok, pillows were filled with animal feathers so my wife whom is allergic to it could barely breathe . She took antiallergie meds so it was tolerable.You get bed, small table & chair and sink. Our restrooms and shower was sherable. Toilet seat was not match to the toiletiu and it was broken, so every time you had to sit, you almost fell... Shower was awfull, small, i belive 70x70 cm. And my pug dog has stronger pee pressure than that shower. After aprox 30-40 km of walking and sightseeing, you would like to take a normal shower. No, cant do... its like they see the water consumption so after few minutes, pressure is dropping and warm water is becoming cold...  Every floor has it's own wifi. One night, I wasnt too tired so I wanted to watch one or two ep. off anything... Hell noo... laptop/netflix... every few minutes wi-fi was down... pretty frustrating. Ok, i could survive all that but i cant forgive and forget THE breakfast... 1st floor, one hotel room was transformed to a dinning area. 3-4 tables for 2. Baguette pieces,Nutella, jam and butter which wasnt in small packages, it was big brick in fridge from you could help yourselves and 50 people before you...  some croissants, juice, milk coffe and thats it. No scrambled eggs. No cereals, nothing... the waitor was an old man in regular clothes, questionable hygiene, looked like i guest that is serving other guests... So of course i ate only one time there...  I traveled across the europe and everywhere, the buffet breakfast was great, you can actually feed yourself, and be ready for walking....  It's hostel, not hotel and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone... ",1

54612,"We stayed here for 5 nights however our first trip to antalya was ruined by this hotel and some of its staff. The morning after we arrived, our room phone rang and it was a tour rep who wanted to sell us excursions. Little did we know that it wasnt the hotels tour rep but from a third party company which the hotel allowed. The mans was OZCAN. He seemed like a good honest guy however was a liar and crook. I have posted his picture below. He sold us 3 excursions for £340 that were completly different to what he explained. Each of them also being a 4 hour drive from the hotel. Do not trust this man. Guest relations at the hotel are useless. There is literally no point of them being there. All they did was smile and said they could not do anything. I really wish i didnt stay this hotel as their are the same type of resorts like this around antalya. Will never be staying here again.",1

55416,"Just returned from the Hotel Best San Fransisco Salou. The Receptionists need to take happy pills; they are glum. Hotel is very clean and the room's  are cleaned very efficiently every day. The resteraunt food is varied with plenty of choice. However; the only hot food you will get is what you wait for to be grilled or stir fried for you on request. The rest will either be cold or tepid. I also had food heaven for me one night with a seafood selection of clams; mussles; whelks; razor clams and  squid. The resteraunts staff are miserable glum and occasionally rude and need to understand customer service. They are efficient just the worst example of friendly and helpfulness that anyone would expect. However the one stand out staff member for me is the guy on reception at night. I left my mobile in a local bar went down to reception to ask if he could find me the telephone number of the bar so we could call them to see if they had found it. Mr Grumpy would not even try and refused to help. In general apart from the staff we found our Russian brothers and sisters should apply for jobs in this hotel. They share the same attributes. Miserable, rude, not ashamed to jump the queue and push you out the way to get the food. Meal times will show you how greedy and inconsiderate so many people are. Stack piling food on plates then not eating it. The waste was incredible.   Having spoken to other travellers who also stayed at Best Hotels near-by it seems they are much the same. Salou caters for most people the Beaches and sea fantastic. A great range of Bars and restaurants but it seems tha many the Hotels are hit or miss. May look at self catering if we return. ",1

4294,"Arrived at the Pelican to a warm welcome from the receptionist, very easy and quick booking in process.  Given our key card and up into the lift we go. we were very excited to see our room as the pictures on line were great ...... on opening the door our hearts sank .... this has got to be the smallest hotel room on the planet !!!!! 3/4 bed, 1 small bedside with 1 small drawer, the other side was a combination cupboard, where the base part housed the safe and nothing else above was a case rack  (which hung over the bed ) I and above that a rail with 6 hangers, on the very top were the bath towels .... couldn’t use the suitcase rack because you then couldn’t hang your clothes so that had to be kept in the shower as no where else.  Only one person at a time could walk by the bed on both sides.  Very small round coffee table in the corner for kettle tea coffee etc flat screen tv ... no chair or table.  Bathroom was minute to say the least only enough room for one.  Linen ok but shower screen and tray filthy. Carpet was very dirty and very stained.  I know they say you only get what you pay for but that was ridiculous!!!",1
18568,"I had put the Do Not Disturb sign on my door for most of my stay but decided that I needed extra amenities on the second last night of my stay. My sis left her watch on the table but came back to find it missing. We thought it was a mistake given the great reviews for this hotel so we raised it to the hotel and the hotel reassured us that they will check with their cleaning staff. They did not get back to us until we asked about it when we were checking out. To which they simple told us that the item was not seen and could not be found. Unfortunately, as we were rushing to catch our flight, we left behind an iPad Pro in the room which we were using just that morning. On the direct train to the domestic airport, we realised that it was left behind (only an hour has passed) and called up the hotel, hoping that they would keep the iPad until we returned to Tokyo a couple of days later. But the hotel informed us that the room has been cleaned and there was no iPad to be found. There was no way that the iPad was left anywhere else and we clearly remembered that we left it in the room. Such a dishonest hotel should be avoid at all costs. What an expensive lesson to be learnt. Perhaps Tokyu stay next door would be a better option.",1
23075,"The Thalassa hotel in Sousse is a mixed bag.  The staff work hard but have to deal with hand writing all receipts, reservations etc. which can be time consuming.  Some staff are very professional some are not.  Our room was a bungalow and was pretty run down and old.  Beds were uncomfortable, stains in some of the sheets and curtains.  Not bad enough for me to leave though.  The pool and slides were great.  The beach was gorgeous and there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas.  The food was average but the lines could be long.  They ran out of plates and cups so a few times we had to wait for dishes.  The price was very inexpensive so don't go expecting a 4 star resort.",1

Sashimi was fresh and they use a lot of seafood from Japan, even for business lunch set. Good value. Other food such as tempura, grilled fish in the bento box were just an average quality, or I would say it wasn't up to 5 star hotels quality standard.

The outdoor jacuzzi was nice, however again poorly finished - there was dirt around the edges of the tiles which was a little unsightly.   Overall we were disappointed with the the standard of the room after the reception and pool area was so lovely.   We had a lovely week though, didn't spend much time in the room.

The restaurant and bar area were also a little grotty and could do with a good spring clean (especially the glass).

They were all noticeably doing their best to provide the best service they could. Well done to them.  The buffet breakfast was yummy.",1

22118,"We booked this hotel based on some nice reviews we read but in all honesty they must of been fake...   It is situated in a rather dodgy and smelly alleyway, albeit within walking distance to the Dotombori area..  The hotel, although clean and relatively new but felt like a hostel experience for the price of a hotel. The front desk foyer and restaurant area upon entry felt very clinical and cheap - not warm or welcoming. Lots of white light- it felt like you were entering a medical centre rather than a hotel...  The rooms are very cheaply made, and not at all practical. It’s the small inconveniences that make your stay here unpleasant.. - Firstly, you have to choose between eco friendly or regular room makeup service upon arrival. We of course chose the eco friendly option which ironically rewards you with free water in a plastic bottle. I’m happy not to have linen and towels replaced everyday- but it would have been nice to have had the bed made and sheets tucked in at least once during our entire stay.. - There’s very little space to hang your clothes, bags or other items- not enough closet space or hooks - The room didn’t have anywhere comfortable to sit, rather two small, very uncomfortable stools to sit on. You have to sit on your bed to sit in the room comfortably.. - The floors in rooms were incredibly hard - walking in the room hurts your feet.  - Beds were very uncomfortable and hard- mattress was very thin on top of a rock hard base. Not a very comfortable sleep.. - Walls were paper thin- you could hear lots of noise from your neighbors and outside the room.. - No bath in the rooms- shower worked fine but you are very enclosed - it’s like taking a shower in a closet - didn’t feel nice at all.  - Bathroom space is very cramped.. no where to put any of your toiletries.. - Breakfast experience is horrible - its free but that just attracts everyone from the hotel to be in in the restaurant at the same time. And honestly it’s the some of worst quality food I’ve eaten anywhere - very processed food - lacking any sort of fresh, quality options. The restaurant area is just packed with Chinese tourists every morning- hard to get a seat. Felt like a feeding farm rather than a nice dining experience. I’d rather pay for the breakfast and have some quality food options and somewhere to sit! After the 1st time we just ended up just skipping it and eating breakfast elsewhere every morning  The staff were lovely and helpful- were able to assist with everything we needed but unfortunately the facilities here are just terrible.. it’s overcrowded and unpleasant.. for the price you pay- certainly not worth it..",1
30699,"I have fond memories of W Taipei 8 years ago and gave a 5 star rating. Unfortunately the latest stay fall short of expectations in many areas.  1) Upon arrival, check in took more than 20 mins with only my family (3 rooms) at the counter. This is a lot slower than other hotels we have visited this trip which usually take around 5 mins.  2)  My dad's room TV couldn't be powered on. But when we call the whatever whenever line, it took more than 20 mins for someone to pick up which is horrible for a 5 star hotel. Also, my room curtain is faulty and one light casing is falling off. The technician told me that they can only fix it the next day as they have to take out a row of the blind to reroll it.  3) W breakfast used to be Wow. But this time, breakfast was served on 31 Floor and it has a very  makeshift feeling. Buffet spread is also lesser than normal. Worst still, on one of the days, it took us 3 tries to get the staff to bring us some milk for the tea. In fact, Meda the F n B manager has to serve it to us and we highlighted our unhappiness to her. She explained to us that a lot of the staffs are very new. Meda is very friendly and have a fantastic personality. I would have given this review a 2 star if not for her. Also, as part of service recovery, she has given my mom a nice cake for mother's days. She just started as   f n b manager recently and i have no doubt she will be able to get the staffs up to standard again.   4) Yen restaurant is a huge disappointment. We were expecting wow food since its also Michelin restaurant but it turns out to be one of the worst food experience we have for our 7 days Taiwan trip. The recommended Iberico pork was so bad as  meat is very tough and pork smell is strong. For a supposedly tender succulent dish  we have to use a knife to cut it. We highlighted this to the staff and for service recovery it was replaced with a plate of roast pork. Unfortunately it taste average too so we didnt touch most of it. Waiter noticed it and didn't charge us for the item (kudos to the staff but it doesn't change the fact that the food is substandard). The other signature the duck dish that everyone seems to rave about is another huge disappointment. The skin is suppose to be the best part of this dish but unfortunately it is not crispy at all. This is a huge contrast from the same dish that we have tried in Yilan Jin Ying hotel just the day before where skin is crispy  and warm. Other dishes are just mediocre as well and not befitting of the Michelin star.   5) Room also seems a bit dated and is time for renovation. The sink is very low and uncomfortable to use.  6) If there is one good thing about the stay, its the staffs who are all very friendly. But to pay a premium price for W, i would have expected a lot more than what we have experienced. Upon checkout, the day manager has apologized for our bad experience. I think W has to up their game especially with the new hotels coming up.",1
6880,"Hong Kong isn't like other South East Asian cities in that it is a bit more expensive and you don't get a free breakfast at most places. Mei Ho had a breakfast that did the job, nothing fancy, not much fresh fruit but that can be said of most of the hotel restaurants in HK. The rooms are really clean and efficient and the people at the front desk are very helpful. I would stay here again if I go back to HK.",1

It is not in the most central part but all of Sydney's attractions is just within a 3 kilometer walk.",1
30836,"I've stayed at a good number of similar class hotels in the city.  After reading the great reviews here, I decided to give this hotel a try even though they are not one of the hotel groups I regularly patronize.  The location of the hotel is great and is in close proximity to many restaurants and the exhibition center.  However, the immediate area around the hotel is undergoing some street repair/construction so it's loud and dirty to walk around.  One of the key factors I use in judging the service of a 5-star hotel is whether I have to touch the front door when entering/exiting the hotel.  I believe guests shouldn't have to lay their hands on the hotel front door at any hotel that consider themselves 5-star.  At this hotel, however, I had to open the door myself 80% of the time.  I've gone in/out of the hotel around 10 times and in only 2 of those 10 times someone opened the door for me (the same staff member Charles Wang in both cases).  At other times, there were either no staff at the door or they were just standing around.  I can go on and on pointing out all the improvements they need to make in-order to bring themselves up to par with other 5-star hotels internationally but that really should be their management's job.  While I'm pretty pleased with their room quality and facilities (sauna, fitness room, pool inside/out), the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Generally, people stay in 5-star property first for their service and second for the property.  So, the fact that they offer only 3-star service really makes this hotel not worthy of the Four Seasons name.  I would not be staying here again.",1
51788,"I stayed here a few years ago, it was lovely, the staff were helpful and friendly.  They made excuses about the staff this time, lots of talk about how covid has affected their bussiness. I think everybody has been affected by covid, we all know it has taken a toll on the world, so useing it as an excuse for poor service is not good enough anymore.  I remember breakfast was included in the room price the last time I stayed. I took a breakfast at 95thb, which seemed a little expensive, but it was convienient, I was then charged 65thb for a cup of tea!!!! Not only did I have to ask for milk and sugar, but when I saw the bill for 65thb for a cup of warm water, at tea bag and a small amount of milk I was VERY angry! The evening before I was walking across the road and for 50thb I ate dinner and had a drink. So 65 thb for a cup of tea just made me angry.  I remember the restaurant, and the view from upstairs, I told my wife about this, she was looking forward to it. Maybe taking a thai cooking class one day, that used to be offered. I walked up the stairs and the doors were tied together with string. If they had just left some tables out, sold some drinks from reception, customers could have at least relaxed there and enjoyed the view. What a shame.  The beds were so uncomfortable, I am sure they wanted to give us an authentic Thai experiance with the beds and this is what they may have used at home. But I am not used to sleeping on something like that, it was so worn you could feel the springs in places! I woke up every morning with my body aching like I had just fought five rounds with Buakaw Banchamek.  We were given a tiny piece of paper with the hotels address on it, not a profesional bussiness card, but a tiny thin piece of paper, which gets lost in your pocket, or sweated into a ball in the humidity or just plain lost. This is a cost cutting measure by the hotel and a bussiness card would have been useful and more profesional.  I was even stopped by people asking me for directions to the hotel in the street because they could not find it and their cab driver couldn't either.  Every taxi, tuk tuk and motorcycle taxi couldn't find it that I took and I ended up just stopping them at the 7-11 and walking the rest of the way.  I could see how everything has changed in the hotel, I would say it is not a hotel anymore but a hostel and there were better ones up the street.  I will find another hotel for a more authentic Thai experiance.  I will not return.",1

2757,"My experience at the Generator Barcelona was truly awful. Hostels are supposed to be easy, efficient and cheap places to stay. However, the Generator is none of those things. My trouble began when checking in. They claimed to not have me booked for 3 nights, despite my email which confirms I had a reservation. They proceeded to charge me 450€ (because I was not in the system) even though I confirmed I would pay 350€. That is completely unacceptable. They scrambled to find me a bed and put me in the most repulsive room with obnoxious roommates — one man came back drunk at 5am, vomiting and crying. My roomcard rarely worked and needed to be replaced several times. The pictures the Generator posts online are extremely deceiving, as the rooms are tiny, VERY hot, there are no lockers nor curtains. Staff members were very rude and not helpful at all. They took no accountability for their mistakes and made it seem like I caused the issues. Don’t they work in the hospitality industry? My stay at the Generator was anything but hospitable.  Every other guest I spoke to also had poor experiences. Not to mention, after paying a ridiculous amount of money for a hostel (which should be cheap) I saw random people sleeping on lobby couches FOR FREE. So while I paid a ton of money for a tiny and uncomfortable bed, some people slept for free on the couch. Because my room was so awful, I found it easier to spend time in the lobby with my friends. However, when we tried having a conversation at a table, the front desk man rudely told us to shut up meanwhile there were loud and drunk people stumbling through the lobby at 3am. So you’re telling me, we cannot have a calm conversation with my friends, yet it’s okay to be loud and overly intoxicated? I will never recommend this hostel to anyone. Even if it’s your cheapest option - don’t go.",1

22442,"Will don't recommend this hotel for the following experience. We came here to stay 4 days with the family to spend Xmas time . Upon arrival we asked for restaurant bookings in any of their restaurants . We got shocked when we were told all restaurants are full for the entire week. I complained and I said how can the hotel be full in all the restaurants for the entire week.  The answer was the main issue of this review. The are full with outside members during the week. I bitterly complained and they told me nothing can be done . I asked for the Duty Manager and I told him I have booked the hotel not just to sleep but to use their facilities and that hotel guests should have priority over outside guests. In many 5 star hotel guests when making a booking they informed you if you want a restaurant booking before arrival to avoid problems or even they block space for hotel guests . In this hotel guests are not priority as I could see. After insisting and asking for their FNB Managet or GM , they gave me a booking at 5 pm for the dinner !? We ended having all meals in other places . This is not the way a supposed 5 star works.  And another "" poor hypocrite hotel standard "" that I hate is when they ask you with nice sentences to take care of the ""loving environment "" and ask you to reuse towels and linens. We all know that's the trick to save their own cost , because later they place tens of plastics bottles for the amenities and water which can be even more damaging to the environment . See pictures below .  Same same , when I realized  they still use incandescent lights which are the worst for the environment . Hypocrites policy .   Suggestions for the rooms : Place more lights as is very dark. Have more towel hooks. The bathroom just have one hook to hang 4 towels .   The location is good if you plan to stay in the MienDong area.   Will not come here again .  ",1
8363,This was a less-than-impressive hotel.  The front-desk staff were actually rude at times.  The hotel is extremely dated and needs a remodel badly.  Bellmen were the nicest people we encountered at the hotel but they could not make up for the rudeness of the front desk staff.  ,1
59482,"This is my second visit to the same ryokan. The staff who serves me is not as friendly as my previous visit. The mattress is too thin and I suggest the owner should upgrade or change a new one. I visited in the month of Oct 17; whereby, the raining season and it is quite cold. It is difficult to sleep on thin mattress on the floor. Despite of that, the room is clean and is located in very quiet place, where you can really rest and sleep.",1
21545,"We have booked 4 nights in this hotel. It is situated in Shinjuku district and there is an underpass (B1 level) that takes you straight from Shinjuku station West Exit to the hotel (without even crossing a road) It took us a bit of time to find it as Google Map for Shinjuku station was quite confusing.  My twin room was spacious (20+ m2) according to Japanese standards. The staff could speak good English (reception as well as the housekeeping hotline), the room was in good condition though the hotel was definitely not new (celebrated 50th anniversary 2 years ago) I think there must have been a recent renovation.  The only fault really was the wifi. I would not expect a 4* hotel 's wifi would be so bad. Basically connecting to the hotspot was not a problem, but once connected basically you could not access internet or it was so slow it took ages to load one webpage. At the end i gave up on the wifi and stayed with my mobile day pass.  Besides that i think staying at the hotel was a great experience! There were many restaurants inside the building and it would only take a few minutes to get to the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku.",1
6390,"Good Location... Average Service.....Poor Housekeeping Review of Novotel Sydney Darling Square Reviewed today To be honest , there is nothing special about this hotel other than its location. This was not like this two years ago when I stayed here just before the pandemic.  Check in was smooth. The staff at the check in counter was helpful though it took a while for them to attend to me. For some reason, two people were attending to the same guest for a long time.  Room size is good.... very poorly equipped. There is no writing pad / pen / no dental kit/no shaving kit. Surprisingly no water bottles too...when i checked on water I was told that I need to pay and buy from room service which quite expensive compared to what you could buy from the store right across the hotel.  House keeping is extremely poor. Very irregular service. Further once you leave the tray after eating (what you ordered through room service) it takes ages for them to clear it and its not a pleasant sight to have stale food right outside your door.  Food options are good during the day but very limited during the night. Breakfast spread is good, but no flexibility. No made to order eggs, but had to eat what is made in bulk and kept at the buffet counter.  Concierge desk is a disaster.. I wonder why they should have one.  They can just someone to help with luggage alone rather than having a desk with fancy computer.  I needed some information and I asked the elderly gentleman about it and his response was ""Check google... now a days everything is on google ""  If everything is on google and that is what they want us to have, why have a desk at all.  Overall I would say very ordinary stay. I am sure , I would have got the same service at IBIS next door for a much lower price.  I may not stay here during my next visit.",1
6380,"We stayed with family for leisure. It was very underwhelming. The checkin was long and uninspired, the bar provided terrible service, average food and underpoured drinks at premium prices. Great location for Vivid. No one slept as the rooms were overheated and could not be changed.  Check out was much the same- not even “how was your stay?”",1
16308,"The hotel has very friendly staff, and the food was very good, even though saying the breakfast is free, unfortunately it is not. The cleanliness of the rooms when you first enter look amazing, but upon further looks it’s very poor, with having stains on the floor, the phone not been dusted in a very long time, having the last gentleman who was there having his beard trimmings all over the place and many other problems. The clearers did do a good job of doing the beds, changing the sheets, clean towels, fresh toilet roll and do the dishes, that is when they came, which was every 3 days. I was staying there for 3 weeks.  Bahrain is a beautiful place but I wouldn’t give this hotel a 4 stars as it says. Please do better and I may consider staying again.",1
10634,"The main hotel and grounds were beautiful, but once you got behind the door to your room it's another story. Our room was a ""townhouse"" and felt more like a frat house. Air conditioning did not work, furnishings were so stained you didn't want to sit on them. Just felt very old, dated and dirty. Was not comfortable.  There were red spots on the pillow cases which seemed like blood dots. We booked a partial ocean view room and received a concrete balcony with bushes so there was no view. They did get the ac fixed but I would not stay there again, nor would I recommend them. The valet was awesome! ",1
3,"First online review of anything, but I feel I must share. My family stayed at The Leon for five nights in early August 2022. I had arranged for the stay due to the location and the website photos. The room was nice enough, and quite clean. However, the service was spotty at best. Some days we got toiletries, some days not. Some days we got enough towels, some days not. I went to the front desk to ask to borrow a bottle opener and the attendant was completely baffled by the request. They evidently skip those basic amenities that other hotels have been providing for decades. This was all fine. We are not complainers, even though the price we paid was about average for our one or twice yearly trip to New York. The real problem arose upon checkout. The hotel is located at an unusual intersection so before leaving we asked where best to catch a cab. We got a dismissive reply that provided very little in the way of useful information. Any other hotel would have offered to arrange for a car. We left the premises and spent 15 or 20 minutes in extreme heat unsuccessfully attempting to get a cab (no more than 3 or 4 even passing in that time). My husband decided to return to the hotel and ask them to call a cab for us. For reasons unknown, this resulted in the gentleman behind the desk exploding. He began shouting at my husband and verbally abusing him. It was truly a shocking and bizarre experience. We travel extensively and this was perhaps the poorest customer service we have encountered. Don't be deceived by the quaint photos - The Leon Hotel is anything but welcoming.",1
43259,"Stayed more than month on  & felt not worse as other reviews. Monthly rental was reasonable around $12000 and 2 cleaning days/ week. All housekeeping maids are nice, Sandy, Amy, Joey, Mary….thank you so for your efforts! My room was facing the sea and it’s was quiet mostly. However, staycation system are too strong so I got disturbed by human noise every weekend, and some kids ran along at corridor kept laughing so loud at morning and night. Strange thing that another chopping meats sounds near me in the morning to noon… so interesting! Hotel provided around 25 seats shuttle bus to subway station, sometimes were full at weekend! A minor issue of air duct need improve coz food smell, cigar smell frequently came into my room from duct.  Overall, the area is quiet and good for relaxing in truth, honestly I’m not recommend to stay the time unless HK family staycation is finished.",1
9860,"Pros: - Nice building - Luckily, we got the room shown in the photographs and it was pleasant enough - The lady receptionist during the day was helpful and spoke decent English - Good selection of toileteries in the bathroom, but the cream wasn't great  Cons: - The ""Managing Director (on his business card) / Nightime receptionist"" tried hard, but given his very limited English, wasn't really helpful - The place was overheated non stop - The Breakfast was too basic and not very fresh - Don't order their scrambled eggs! We don't know what they were, but definitely not scrambled! - The Breakfast area wasn't very pleasant, otherwise nice view - The toilet flushing is an art to be mastered! - The shower was like a fire hydrant and the paint was peeling off the bathtub - They should mention on their website how far the place is from the Old city and any other tourist attractions. It is miles away from the major sites and it's at least a 30 minute taxi ride to get to where you want to go.  This said, we found that taking a short taxi to Urskubah, then a ferry and then a tram was about the same amount of time but far more fun (and cheaper). - The place was like a morgue. It had no feeling and so one wouldn't meet at the Bar and chat with other guests - If you are faint of heart and are given to reacting badly to being awoken at 0500 by the local Imam shouting for all people within a 30 mile radius to come to prayer, then you might want to think again about your choice of hotel - we gave up trying to watch any TV as having to scan through hundreds of channels just to find the one English channel available, was too time consuming. We asked for a list of channels but the Managing Director shook his head in bewilderment, which we took to mean that they didn't have one. - after breakfast on our first day, looking forward to our lengthy trek into town, we asked the Managing Director for a map. After much hand conversation, shuffling of papers, reviewing of numerous irrelevant brochures we gave up and decided to wing it ourselves.  If the price had been 50% of what we paid it would have been the correct value for money.",1
56003,"The price you pay for this hotel and what you get are 2 very different things .  The rooms are very budget , we didn’t even have tea or coffee facilities in our room, our check in wasn’t until 4 pm , our room only got cleaned 1 of the 4 days we where there , parking cost us $105 per day , i would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone ",1
3070,"We stayed in a family room for 4 nights, but had we known the room was so small, we would have definitely booked two twin rooms instead. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was good- especially the shower. But the air conditioning was not adequate for four people in the middle of August.   So we spoke to the manager and he quickly gave us a fan which helped a lot. Also, the staff delivered a mixed service; the manager and kitchen staff were consistently friendly. But we were greeted by a member of staff who tried to make jokes that were quite frankly rude. It has to be said that this particular member of staff was politer the next day though. We had a problem on our second evening, as we returned to the hotel at around 10 pm but the doors were locked. After knocking and waiting for five minutes with my daughter who desperately needed to use the toilet, a member of staff finally opened the door. When I asked why the door was locked, he replied very disrespectfully. He also mimicked what I said and asked in a very rude manner: 'why are you so angry? I only went downstairs, you didn't have to wait that long.'  Even though we booked for four adults, we had to request an extra bed- which wasn't a problem but I had to go up and down the four flights of stairs five times to ask for the pillow for that bed.   On the positive side, breakfast was really good and there was a wide choice everyday. The location was also excellent, and most places were within walking distance. There were also a range of restaurants very near to the hotel.  The location is really the best feature about this hotel, so if you are looking for somewhere that's close to the centre but you are willing to compromise with other features, then this hotel is ideal.",1
8088,"I booked a five day quick break , I chose the junior suite as it boasted of generous square footage and great layout. I consider Rixos as a luxury hotel boasting of tranquil surroundings with mature guests however when I arrived I was informed of a stage being outside my suite which host DJs for music til 12am.., also I was informed that I had no other option ..  I thought there goes my quiet , luxury, tranquil rest break… I spent the first night and it was disastrous! In come Olga from Guest relations who turned my holiday around .. she sourced for the same suite in an area that still gave me access to all the facilities , and to my satisfaction , over the period of my holiday she gave me access to facilities that enabled me to relax and forget about my first night experience… Olga kept in touch with me throughout my break to ensure that everything was okay .. I have to say that Olga should be stepped up a position so that she is able to make decisions if guests such difficulties as she managed the whole process with professionalism ..  I would also like to thank the lovely Mohammed Ali (buggy driver) who always drove around with a smile and always acknowledged his guests , Karim in the restaurant who always knew my drinks , was very polite and hard working with a pleasant character , and Mahmood Abdul Wahab on the beach , as well as all the other and many workers that made my stay fabulous … and not forgetting my suite attendant who always kept 190003 looking clean and tidy when I returned .. thank you ",2

What a comforting, pleasant surprise this place was! Room were nicely decorated and roomy. Desk clerk (Steve) and both shuttle drivers were extra friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Unlike many places, they had some rolls and coffee out for people with flights before the breakfast time, much appreciated at 330 in the morning!  Pick up at the airport was within 15 minutes, our car was parked at the office with cold water and cookies waiting for us inside! Felt like a VIP! Found a nice restaurant nearby for supper, thanks to Steve's information on arrival.  Rode to the airport with a woman who had used this place 5 times, said Steve is always this helpful and friendly. I know we would use again!",2

61277,"We stayed for 8 days early April, very close to Singapore reopening for tourism. We were made very welcome and we were impressed with the hotel. The location was excellent  and we often walked to the gardens by the bay, despite the humidity  and the local folk thinking we were nuts! A quick bus ride (bus stop) right outside the hotel gets you to Semtosa Island and a taxi will take you to the singapore zoo ( we loved seeing the Pandas) as mentioned, Singapore were very new to reopening after covid restrictions and the breakfast buffet was a little chaotic at times! Staff having to get your requirements felt a little restrictive but overall it was a good buffet selection. We didn't have any other meals at the hotel, as there are lots of restaurants just across the bridge, access to the rear of the hotel. Overall it was a good hotel to stay in. And Singapore made us very welcome. ",2

I did have a small problem with the Room but it was dealt with quickly, efficiently and without fuss.  Breakfast Buffet had a good selection and the Hotel Bar was the ideal place to relax after a busy day.  Good location for the Centre, Metro etc.  I would have no hestitation to stay again",2

56251,"A good hotel in the Centrale area.  We stayed  2 nights in a superior room on the 4th floor in November 2022. The room is really new  and very clean. The room was hot because the air conditioning system in the hotel was only turned  for heat, but there is a ceiling fan that provided a partial solution. There is a mini bar with soft drinks that is replenished daily free of charge. The breakfast is very good and includes cheeses, eggs, pies, cakes and croissants , juices and hot drinks. The staff is very  nice. We encountered two major problems. First, the room is not soundproof, this is especially disturbing in the early morning when a garbage truck arrives on the street. You can literally hear the people talking and feel as  the truck is standing in the middle of the room. Another problem is that the Centrale area is unpleasant because of homeless people and scary people in the area.",2

31007,"After staying at Caesar’s Palace last year, we decided to try Paris due to its fantastic location. It is directly across the street from the Bellagio and just a few minutes walking distance to the Miracle Mile. The location definitely was great!!! Check in was very busy and I was a bit frustrated because I took the time to do the online check in only to get there and the kiosk was not working so o had to wait in line. A lot of people experienced this and it happened to us at Caesar’s last year so not quite sure what that is all about. Check in was fast although, I got zero information about the hotel from the agent but he was pleasant. Our room was on the 22nd floor hallways were fresh and clean smelling we got our rooms 2250 and 2251 they were large, spacious and clean. Bathrooms were great although, the one disappointments was the view. I booked directly on the website thinking I would get a better room/view compared to booking.com but, no. I probably should have just booked on booking.com and saved myself hundreds of dollars but, live and learn. It didn’t ruin my stay I don’t stay in the room anyways. The hotel is very very lively and busy. Bars are always packed lots of restaurants but the restaurants are pricey. The pool was amazing! Huge, clean and a great temperature, lots of chairs, pool service. You can order food to be delivered to you by the pool just beware, a pizza (just a pizza) with delivery and tip is almost $70…your paying for convenience I suppose and drinks are pricey but they do allow you to bring drinks and water that you can purchase cheaper inside which is nice and the pizza is phenomenal. Housekeeping did a fabulous job cleaning our room for us as well. If I had to compare it to Caesar’s I would say Caesar’s is definitely more “high end”, the cigar lounge is much better at Caesar’s, I like the pool at Paris it was a much better temperature. They also provided free water at the bar which was great! All in all we had a great stay and would stay again.",2
21526,"We joined our tour group at this hotel which obviously caters to many tour groups. Our twin bed room on the 11th floor was a good size with comfortable beds and 2 comfortable chairs. We were fortunate to be checked in early so we were in our room by 2.30pm. There was a kettle and teabags as well as instant coffee in the room. I went for a walk to explore the area and the doorman gave me an umbrella to use as it was raining. There is also a laundromat on the 11th floor with combined washing machine/dryers that dispense the detergent into the machine. The lobby level had some shops, as well as an art display. There are a number of restaurants in the hotel and we ate at one the first night as part of our group and had a delicious meal. The second night we tried the Chinese Restaurant and the food was quite nice there but I had finished my dessert (sorbet) well before my husband received his dessert - not particularly good service. We arrived at breakfast just before 6.30am on the first morning and there was a huge queue which gradually went into the breakfast restaurant until a few people before us when we had to wait for the first people to finish breakfast before we could enter. People coming later had to queue for a considerable time! The next morning we were directed up to the function room on the 5th floor which they had opened for Buffet Breakfast, a much better experience. The buffet both mornings was good. The Hotel is a short walk from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building where you can get a good free view over Tokyo.",2
21801,"This is a good hotel placed few minutes of walking distance from City Hall metro station.

Free coffee and cookies are offered at reception area around the clock. Good price for this location. ",2
22150,"Recomended if you are planning to visit Osaka on your own using subway.  PROS:  Located at walking distance from Osaka's main markets: shinsaibashi and dotonbori.  Lots of meal choices for any budget. 5 min walking distance from Namba station (this station connects to all lines- must see destinations in Osaka).  Breakfast included (and delicious!) Courtesy coffee/ tea in the afternoon  Extremely clean and tidy Helpful and friendly staff. *** special thanks to Kim Chanyang of the front desk who made everything possible for us to have a pleasant stay. Thanks for all your help and patience with all our inquiries :) *** The hotel is very quiet, despite being located at a very crowded market  CONS: Please keep in mind that rooms are small (they are OK for Japanese standards) so if you are traveling with a large group, pay special attention to bed's size  The Namba station is a 5min walk to the hotel...if you carry a lot of luggage, you must use exit 24 to access the electric stairs...otherwise the other exits will dump you on lots of stairs.  HOW TO GET THERE: Once you get to Namba station, look for exit 24 or 25, once outside do not cross the street! Simply walk towards the east, once you see ""emporio Armani"" shop, go into that small street and you will see the hotel sign -its a tall building, next to a ""red crab"" sign ;)",2

However, it is relatively easy to get to all the tourist attractions by taking bus 57 or tram 12 to the center or Carolli M1. It costs 2 euros per adult and free for kids. You can buy the ticket at the lobby. The area has decent dining and cafe.  The hotel room is very spacious (a lot bigger than a typical European hotel room) and the bathroom has both a shower and a bathtub. The cleaning crew does a pretty decent job daily. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and were able to help us with directions. I would recommend this hotel.",2

Armand should be really proud of the team he has.  There was no hesitation from the staff when my twelve year old was surfing and the roads were closed to buggy’s for a cremation ceremony for one of the reception staff to go and collect her in their motorbike so she wasn’t waiting.  Then on our last morning when our eldest came down with Bali belly at 5.30am we were escorted straight to a doctor and the staff waited with us to ensure he was okay before taking us back.  Be patient with the language barriers on Nusa Lembongan, there is stuff occasionally lost in translation but the friendliness of everyone here really makes your stay.  Thank you to all of the staff.",2
61850,"We had very mixed reviews of Jury's Inn. The location couldn't have been better - it was so centrally located to all the attractions as others note.  The staff was lovely and did whatever they could to help, such as early check-in and reserving tickets around town. The lobby and bar area are cute and posh, so cute that we were a little shocked getting to the actual hotel room, as it left a lot to be desired. The rooms are very basic. The water pressure in the the shower was barely a trickle when using the hot water. While the windows kept out the street noise, we were awoken a few times by other people closing their doors and hallway conversations. It was also very hard to control the temperature in the room without a thermostat, so we resorted to opening our windows in November as the little fan provided didn't do much. ",2
30415,"Overall a good hotel. Good location, clean rooms, great staff in the lobby, etc. But with a huge caveat: my room's air conditioner smelled INTENSELY like urine. It was so strong that if I was walking down a SF street, I would've doubled back and taken another street. I didn't have the time to request a new room due to my late night/early morning, though I'm sure they would have put me in another room. So just double check your A/C before you settle in!",2
56060,Just finished a 3 day stay at the Shangri La Sydney. I booked an Horizon room upgraded to an Opera House view for my wife and I.   The stay was very enjoyable. Our room was kept spotless each day by cleaning staff and the staff in the Horizon Room very obliging in their service to us. It was very busy being school holidays with many families staying and using the clubroom.  2 sittings during this week for the clubroom. 5.30pm to 7pm and 7.15pm to 8.45pm.  We tried both on different nights.  The second sitting is the one to avoid in our opinion. You are now permitted to being a guest in to the clubroom for evening canapés.   The cost is $95.    You can have breakfast in the clubroom or the restaurant.  The clubroom is the better of the 2 locations.  We are looking to our our next stay in the future. It’s still the place to beat .,2
61826,"The good -- lovely staff, good food and fantastic room.    The bad -- even with a security presence in the lobby (never a good sign) I sat in the restaurant in the middle of an afternoon and watch a drug  deal go down in the booth next to me. Money and baggies were exchanged between three people in broad daylight.    This was not subtle, the three were loud, obviously intoxicated and very obviously out of place in pretty empty restaurant.  This gave me no sense of safety in the hotel or the area (which was only validated when I came back after an evening out to find two security guards stationed at the front door verifying keys, room numbers and name of guests before letting anyone in.)  This is really something to take into consideration when travelling on your own or with children.",2

The hotel is just opposite Marine Parade which is very convenient and also a hawker centre where you can pack dinner back easily. Luckily the pool is not very pack, managed to go swimming everyday.   Overall a nice stay as our request for connecting rooms made the day and check in and out was a breeze. The complimentary cake was very tasty a well.   One funny thing was the air con temperature was not adjustable for both rooms and it was very very cold, felt like we were at Genting, got to off the air con for a while.",2

She has a good personality and was a good guide for me. When I arrived in barcelona, I was alone - But when I visited his house, I could make a few friends shortly! Because the house atmostphere was really cozy, I could be a friend of guests' in his house.   Also, jose maria is really active person, he is very cool and try to give guests as many informations as he knows. Whenever I asked him on whatsapp, he was really fast to answer even though I was outside and asked some questions which was not related to house stuff. for example, the place to eat, the place to see, etc..   I got a very good memories in Barcelona thanks to him and his house, if I have another chance to visit spain, I will definitely choose his house again!   Thank you jose maria - from korea",2

Reception in general moves slowly and says no before they say yes. To everything. All the time. As a diamond member who has stayed in 19 Hilton properties over the past 24 months, this one gets bottom ratings for service. Location is superb. If you find something else in same area for better price, go there. ",2

12523,"Coming to Barcelona to do year abroad during a pandemic is one strange thing, but Hostal Martinval provided us with comfort during this time. We stayed for a fortnight in a room with 2 single beds; a double bed; a spacious bathroom and a balcony. It is in Exiample, which is the middle of the city and a 20 minute walk from Sagrada Familia. It is in a lovely area located near many supermarkets, bus stops, metro stations and tapas bars. They gave us a discount as we stayed a week longer even though it was already so cheap. It does not have a kitchen, but a communal space with a fridge, coffee machine, sink and hot water. The staff are lovely and helped us practice Spanish and the rooms are cleaned daily. I would recommend this place to anyone who is coming to stay in Barcelona. With 3 of us staying in 1 room we each paid around 10 euros a night, before our discount. Perfect for students wanting to travel with friends.",2
12199,"We spent a night during Saturday.  It's a nice place with its brand usual standard. We tried the Sunday lunch buffet at great discount with the Eatigo apps. We also had dinner in the Chinese restaurant inside the hotel which is pricey with decent food, as there's no option nearby. There's convenient store in the World Expo 5 mins away on foot.   Room spacious clean with everything.   The pool looks good though we didn't try.   Overall a nice experience with its good price about $1000 a night. ",2
21187,"Looking back on my trip to Rome I have mixed feelings about the Morrisson Hotel. Firstly on arrival to the building I thought it was awful. The building itself on the outside is quite shabby and not what I was expecting. The staircase is shabby with dirty looking walls and pealing paint. So first impressions for me were not great.  However once you reach the fourth floor the entrance to the hotel and inside is the complete opposite. It is very clean,tidy and well maintained. The room itself was very nice and clean. The room was a perfect size, nicely decorated, bright and airy. The only complaint I have about the room was the safe in the room was not working. I asked the girl about the possibility of changing rooms to one that had a working safe but got the impression that none of the rooms had a working safe.   The location of the hotel is okay. It is close to Termini train station. And less than 10 min walk to the metro. It is directly across from the British embassy. The street is quiet, there are not many restaurants or bars etc and although there are street lights we didn't really feel safe walking back there once it got dark so got a taxi every night.   Breakfast is included but not actually available at the hotel. You get a voucher to use in a cafe around the corner from the hotel. We never got breakfast while we were there as we usually left the hotel before 8 o'clock to avoid the queues at the attractions.   The staff - the manager was very friendly and helpful giving information about directions, tourist attractions, transfers to airport etc. However the girl that we first met when we arrived to check in was not as good. She was friendly but didn't make a good first impression for the Morrisson hotel. We arrived just before 1pm which is check in time thinking we could maybe wait in the lobby for the 30mins if the room was not ready. However she checked us in straight away. Which took about 10 -15mins. She then brought us to the room and pointed out the air con, bathroom, mini-bar etc and told us not to waste the water or leave lights on when leaving. I have never experienced this before and did not particularly like it. At this stage it was probably about 12:50. We were then told that we would have to leave the room as check in wasn't until 1pm! Even though she had checked us in, given us the key and brought us into the actual room - we had to turn around and leave. We went down the street for a coffee end returned at 1. The room was the same as it was the 10 minutes before. So don't really know what the reasoning behind this was.   We were in Rome to sight-see and explore so only used the hotel for somewhere to sleep so it was fine for us. Would I stay here again? Yes. But if I could get a hotel for the same price that had a lobby, bar and restaurant I would probably pick there instead.  ",2
7939,"We stayed here for four nights in June of 2019. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  A breakfast buffet was available in the dining room each morning.  The hotel is an easy walking distance to several sidewalk cafes, restaurants, bakeries and pastry shops and ice cream shops, as well as to Notre Dame, St. Chapelle, Fountain of St. Michael, the Louvre, Museum D’Orsay, Museum Pompidou, the River Seine and the Latin Quarter.  It is not far from the Eifel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. I would definitely come back.",2
53833,We had a Business Group stayed at Ambassador Hotel Bangkok of over 400 delegates arriving on different dates but Hotel Specially Khun Nadia at Front desk handled this challenging task very calmly and with no hassle to any of our Guest.

36276,"This is unique experience. The Swartz family (owners) have spent a fortune on renovations making this one of the most elaborate and comfortable hotels in Sydney. Forget those that cost 4x. Staff are excellent. Service unbeatable. To Accor club members free Perrier and wine as well as cheese platter, free breakfast ",2
41756,"I had a very pleasant stay here. During the nyepi, the night view was so spectacular, you can join the ogoh- ogoh parade before nyepi day. The service, room and view was great. I stay at 803 in villa with a private pool, the pool was so clean. Please add another beach activity and the breakfast menu. There is a gazebo in villa but so many ants there, feeling unsafe so we decide to go inside. Maybe the hotel can provide the insect repellent.",2
11993,Generally speking an ok hotel. But room sucks.  Plusses:  Location Elias is very helpfull and friendly  Minuses:  Maria from stuff is too loud without earprotectors! Mattress was too hard. Pillow too hard and high Shower in room is old and messy with water all over the bathroom The balcony doors didn't work Sometimes cleaners forget to give us new towels Once we had to drink instant coffee. They didn't had any real coffee at 9:30 in the morning The room is too small for two single beds.,2
35768,"I've stayed at an Aloft hotel before, so i knew what to expect. My first impression of this hotel was that it was ""fine,"" but then I got in the elevator and was appalled at how dirty and gross the carpet was. It ended up being the worst part of the hotel. I was in all three elevators and all three had terrible carpet.   My hotel room was very clean, I had no complaints there. The location was great with lots of food options nearby and easy access to the busses.  It was far enough from Michigan Avenue that there wasn't crazy noise outside.",2
14376,"I stayed here with my family for 3 nights. Hotel situated 10 min drive from Osaka station. The hotel has a fantastic to & fro free shuttle service to the Osaka station. The staff at the front desk is extremely cordial & helpful. Room size is big. We got a room which had 4 comfortable beds, and a seperate living area. Bathroom is good, with good toiletries and good quality bath linen. Breakfast is not the best and very less options for vegans and vegetarians. The biggest minus point about this hotel is that the usage of pool and the gym is not free and is exorbitantly priced. Where in the world is this facility charged for ? Overall a good stay except the pool & gym was chargeable.",2
39138,"We had a very enjoyable stay here - the hotel is modern and well kept. The location is perfect, only a 5 minute stroll into Fira centre. The staff are excellent - our driver for our transfer didn't show up due to our ferry being delayed by over an hour so the hotel refunded us the money from our alternative arrangement. Would highly recommend this as a pool is necessary if travelling in the summer months.",2
36207,We stayed at the Westside for three nights . A warm welcome in the pouring rain .Umbrella's are provided by the hotel. About a 10 minute walk to the Arc du Triomphe. Lots of eating places near buy. A quiet area at night away from the hustle and bustle of the Champs Elysees. The room was adequate with a balcony but one thing that cant be faulted was the hot water. The best Hotel I have stayed in for getting hot water in Europe.,2
28028,"We were at this hotel in early October. This is one of the special hotels where we were. Recommend to take a room with big balcony and outside jacuzzi with warm water and dramatic wonderful view on the sea and all area .The hotel situated  a little  bit far from OIA .It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to the center but it's very nice walking especially after dinner to burn calories. The restaurant (taverna) opposite nice but a little bit expansive . If you went to OIA it's better to eat there.The service of the in hotel is  excellent, the staff always smiling and always willing to help and answer any question .We will get back to this hotel in future. Very recommended !!!",2
11323,"Absolutely amazing experience, special mention to Duty Manager Sarah who went over and above our expectations. My ute was too tall for the valet parking, so she accommodated us by putting it in a safe driveway with full view of the cameras as I had used street parking the night before and someone had gone through my ute tray",2
15904,Stayed in 2 adjacent rooms as a family of 5. Hotel has no restaurant but surrounded by lots of options. Close to Powell Street Station (direct line to SF airport on Bart). Short walk to Chinatown & Street Car ride to Pier 39.  Hotel itself is fine - rooms as one would expect & staff helpful.,2
9646,This was our  chosen 7 day Sandbox hotel in Rawai.  A three star accommodation venue with a good in-house restaurant on the beach and seating around the large pool on loungers with umbrellas and comfortable tables and chairs to read and relax and eat at.  Not a great beach to swim at due to rocks and flotsam but good for walking with shoes and also for kite- boarding and para-sailing when windy.  Staff were very helpful and eager to please and arrange outings and taxis.,2
56980,"This trip was booked in 2019 for 2020, but Covid intervened and although I had a prepaid and non-refundable booking Casa Mimosa honoured it for April 2022: proper customer service! We had a garden deluxe room on the 4th floor overlooking the courtyard garden and with a perfect view of the rooftop of Gaudi's Casa Mila.  The hotel is perfectly situated in a street parallel to Passeig de Gracia, allowing it to be off the busy thoroughfare yet only 15-20 minutes stroll to La Placa de Catalunya (where the Aerobus stops) and the start of Las Ramblas. All the staff are cheerful and helpful, and our room was a good size for a city hotel, very comfortable and with an excellent shower. The lighting options in the room were also excellent, with good bedside reading lights included. The breakfast spread of cold meats, cheese etc was superb as was the fresh fruit option, and the freshly squeezed orange juice. A wide selection of cooked breakfasts were made to order, which meant a 10 minute wait but well worth it. There are multiple restaurants within easy walking distance; we tried several of the suggestions from the front desk and they were exactly what we had asked for. We would return to Casa Mimosa anytime!",2
25253,"My wife and kids stayed in the Holiday Inn Express hotel for two nights after arriving from US.  We booked 2 rooms at the hotel.  The hotel contacted us before arriving to verify this was not in error.  It was nice they were looking out for us.  Our rooms were small but on par for city hotel room. The hotel is on floors 7-14 and you enter on the ground and take elevator to 7th flor lobby.  This is also where the breakfast is located.  Our room was clean, WiFi worked well, and breakfast was ok.  Typically breakfast from holiday inn express.  We had no problems during our stay and would stay at this hotel again.",2
5963,"Just got back from our trip to Italy and stayed in Hotel Italia in Rome. Room - we were in the annex building directly across the road from the main building,  did have a mini fridge which was good. A touch on the small side as had a put up bed in too but was clean and well maintained.  Up a few flights of steps so not for everyone unless you have small coins for the lift. Breakfast - a good selection of continental breakfast served in the main hotel.   Staff - all very friendly and helpful and could not fault them. Location - quite central for sightseeing but just out of the way of the tourist areas so plenty of traditional trattorias close by.  Walkable from the Termini station, to the Colosseum, Trevi fountain etc and close to a few Metro stations.",2
54395,"It was easy to find which says a lot in Istanbul. Check in was a breeze. We asked about the nearby area and the staff was quick to offer all kinds of suggestions of places to see, food to eat, and how to travel. The room is a little small but comfortable. The bed was very, very comfortable but the pillows go flat. Ask for a couple extra. The bathroom arrangement was odd but it had everything and was clean. Breakfast came with the room and was OK. The coffee was great but the food was just mediocre. However, there are lots and lots of restaurants surrounding the hotel.",2
52401,"The hotel was located within an easy walk of Exit 4 of the Daikokucho station on the Midosuji line--the train line where almost everything is located. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the rooms are not only nice, but come with a smart device for your use around the city and universal chargers.   The hotel is also located near several konbinis  (convenience stores), a grocery store, and a non-tourist fish market near the Ebisu Shrine, which is also a short walk away.   Breakfast has local and seasonal specialties. When I arrived in fall, they were serving takoyaki and mackerel for breakfast, among the usual Japanese and western offerings.   Hotel definitely catered more to the business set, but I liked that. I'd definitely stay here again in Osaka. ",2
47370,"Everything above expectation,the view from my room &the hotel location,the hotel is situated on bangsarei beach, very clean ,with sunset view and closed walking distance on the beach in the evening.Not far from hotel ,you can drive to many restaurants , such as preecha restaurant  ,etc.",2
27889,"Loved the place - stayed 2 nights at the family suite on 5th floor, very spacey even for a family of 5, plus the common area with living room + dining area makes it even more spacey. The layout and interior has been carefully done, adding a lot of pleasure for the guests. The owners have pride and are extremely kind. The only draw back would be the area itself - not much to do around. Yet if you want to take it easy in a roomy and comfy place, this could be something for you!",2
15838,"I visited Barcelona recently with my parents and found these hotel chain. Though I have been in Barcelona many times, it wasn't until now that I got a chance to stay in any their hotels. I loved the hotel, it was a good location ( Though I know there are others that are closer to the main city center depending on your budget). The rooms were spacious enough and the perks you get if you sign up to become a member is just great! You get a welcoming drink and also a drink at either 2 of their bars. The breakfast was really great, you get a plentiful choice of hot and cold items, coffee, the awesome orange juice and the attention by the staff was incredible.  In terms of the pool...unless is something really important to you..It is small, and is at the rooftop.  Everyone was helpful, incredible genuine and friendly. The hotel grounds are pristine and all the small personal touches like the nespresso machine in the room, the complimentary mini bar (if you become a member), the robes...all makes this my new hotels of choice when visiting Spain.

61910,"As a Hilton Diamond member, I was upgraded to a suite with Acropolis views. I was more than happy with the room. It was spacious, modern, clean, comfortable and nicely furnished, with a separate lounge area. There was a balcony from both the lounge and the bedroom which overlooked the Acropolis. Fresh fruit and small cakes/snacks were replenished each day.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful, particularly in the executive lounge. Due to COVID restrictions, there was no self service, so the staff did everything. There was a good selection of soft drinks and snacks all day and two hours of complimentary alcoholic drinks in the evening, including white and red wine and beer. Every time I used the lounge, the service received was second to none. I didn't have to get up or request a refill, as the staff were so attentive, they topped up or refreshed my drinks and snacks as soon as they noticed they were getting low!  The hotel is located a short taxi ride  from many of the sights and from popular areas with an abundance of bars and restaurants, so I would recommend going out to eat and drink. However, it is worth an evening drink on the rooftop bar, just to take in the views. However, the drinks are expensive up there!  I didn't have a chance to use the gym, but the communal areas, bars and restaurants are modern and clean and overall, it's a nice property. ",2
19024,"We were at the hotel for 4 nights with two rooms - 1 double and 1 triple for 3 teen girls. Our double was very good, great bathroom and shower, toiletries, large towels.  Beds were a little firm but with nice bedding. The breakfast was great - lots of choices. The best things about the hotel were the helpful and friendly staff and they had valet parking next door (additional cost). It was close to the central rail station for public transit into the center of Milan and the Mercado dining area of the train station was phenomenal.  The air conditioning did not work in two rooms they assigned to the daughters, however, they finally put them in a suite without any additional charge.  They were accommodating.",2
20792,"My visit here has been nothing short of amazing, The rooms are as clean and luxurious as a 5 star hotel, The staff are helpful. I was intially booked for 20 days , I extended my trip for another week!. The manager Mr Filip took time from his schedule to sit with me and talk to me about the local tourist attractions and what would make my trip more worth while. I highly reccomend this place for anyone looking for an affordable hotel with great service. It is well located on a road full of gyms and fitness centers and only a short ride away from the main tourist attractions!. will definetly visit again!.",2
6913,"We booked ourselves a private room for two, and we were frankly blown away by the quality of the room for the price.  We weren't expecting much, but what we got was a fine room, relatively clean, and absolutely huge. This was perfect for us since we were actually going through an overseas move and had a few pieces of luggage. There was plenty of room, and it was perfect for us.  The only solid complaint I could have about this place is the breakfast. It was pretty small, and the western breakfast was obviously made by a person that has no idea how to make a western breakfast. Every day something new would be cold, and for some reason it included corn.  It's not a reason to avoid this place by any means, but it's a reason to make sure you have alternative plans for breakfast.",2
51415,"It's a bit difficult to find - only 3 stops from the Termini. From the start when you meet Julia she is full of information. Julia is incredibly helpful and will do anything to help you out - nothing is too much trouble. She is great with communication too.  The room is pretty basic, although it has everything you would need - fairly roomy too. Bed is pretty comfy. There is a fridge, a wardrobe, a safe, the TV has loads of channels and has the function where you can change the language to English!  We were in a block of 3 rooms. One of which is bigger and has the ensuite. Otherwise you get the communal bathroom.  The breakfast is basic, but all good. They make everything for you on the spot. But there is also a kettle left out and some snacks for you available during the day and evening.  All in all for the money - its great value and Julia is the most accommodating host.",2
1134,Spent a week here while visiting family.  I was generously upgraded to the the attic suite.   Daily breakfast was delicious and plentiful.   Staff was friendly and attentive.   Room cleaning was meticulous.  Only a 10 minute walk to “central” prague across the river.  Close to all kinds of restaurants and cafes.  I intend to stay here whenever I visit.,2
54893,"So we had a lovely stay in Dublin, the location, price and amenities in the Staycity Dublin are great. It was clean, the staff were nice and it had everything we needed within a short walk of Temple Bar. My only issues are that it didn't seem very secure, anyone can walk into reception and as far as I can remember you can just walk in and go straight up the stairs to the rooms and although nothing happened while we were there it that always played on my mind a bit while we were there. Secondly the keyless app was a faff to use and took us several tries each time we returned to our room.",2
65485,"The location is hard to beat: you are smack in Shibujia and the free shuttle bus takes you in two minutes to the gigantic intersection you heard about (it's a roughly ten-minute walk along a high-end shopping street). The free dinner (!) is nice, too as is the massage service offered (not free) and the fast wifi. The rooms are small but well-equipped with soft beds. There is no view as nearly all windows are glazed over with a non-transparent coating. The rooms are completely quiet even though there is a train line next to it.",2

18184,"We loved our stay in Thiera Suites ! We came to celebrate our anniversary and it completely exceeded all our expectations . Firstly , they are located at the entrance of magical town of Oia , where you are met by the lovely lady who manages the place and a porter to take your suitcases down . There are steps , quite a few of them but it all adds to the charm of the place . We were lucky to be given suite 4 , which was the most private of them all with its own entrance and a massive terrace with hot tub overlooking the sea below . Words can’t describe how beautiful it is !!! And then the room itself , so elegant and spacious , with everything you might need ( fridge , coffee machine , kettle , cutlery all provided ) during your stay . We were also given a small bottle of prosseco on arrival , which was lovely ! The bathroom was amazing ! It is huge , with great shower / jacuzzi bath combo . This was , in our opinion, without the doubt the best place to stay in Oia because of its private location . There is a very expensive hotel in town called ‘ Secret Santorini’ which is located on the main thoroughfare in Oia , but for us this was the only place that can call itself ‘secret Santorini ‘ because you are blessed to have your own oasis just outside of all the hustle and bustle in Oia town . We can’t recommend this place highly enough , if we come back to Santorini this would be the only place we would ever consider staying in ! Thank you Thiera Suites for making our anniversary even more special ! ",2
28721,"I have stayed in so many hostels in U.S. and other countries and this is the first one that I have unpleasant memories. My bedroom (shared, 4 beds) had a strong stuffy smell. Getting back to the hostel at night very tired, ready to sleep and smelling that was not good at all. Also it didn't feel easy to meet other travelers as the other hostels I have stayed. There were some armchairs in the computers area and also the big dining room, but I missed a ""cozy"" and welcoming room to simply hang out on the couch for example and meet people. I didn't feel that ""hostel vibe"" and it didn't feel like a ""party hostel"" as they promote themselves.  Besides that, it was always tricky to open the bedroom door with that key (I have seen others having problems too). And I had just one backpack, but the hostel has many stairs so it is hard for travelers with many bags.  Otherwise, good location, breakfast was ok, most of the times I could find a bathroom available, safe (room to store bags is locked, also there were cameras in the hostel and we had to show our room key when getting back to the hostel), and not all, but some staff members were friendly.",2
23467,"Why the best: its quite than the busy traffic around Kingdom tower (Four seasons) and around Faisaliyah tower (mandarin oriental). Ritz is too far from work and life .. so I love this place / great gym, spa and swimming pool - great service - quieter which is cool and no headache of joining malls through centria mall with great shopping and 4 super restaurants is across the street. easy to get to and great for family too as well as business.",2

6295,The lobby was really nice with the sunlight. However as I got to the bar area there was one employee making extremely homosexual jokes on the front of the bar while laughing. However there were other employees who were not happy with this and apologised to me. Very good housekeeping and room service.,2
48751,"This place goes way above and beyond anything I would ever expect of a B&B! When I first entered the rooms I thought it was a 5 star luxury hotel. The interior decoration is simply amazing, there is so much great art here (even works from the owner himself) and all rooms have their individual style. Its located in the middle of the city and is very easily reachable, you can walk to place de Catalunya and there are authentic restaurants nearby. The staff here is incredly friendly too, always trying to make the stay as convenient as possible. I had the great pleasure of getting to spend time with Ferran, the owner, who showed me around Barcelona and pointed out some of the hidden treasures of the city, like the cafe Picasso frequented with his friends. He's an inspiring personality with many interests and I admire his straightforward ways. Overall I was blown away by this place and will be very sad to leave. I can only recommend this B&B!  Natalie, Shanghai",2
31074,"I have stayed at the Paris several times now as well as some other hotels, and I just happened to need to stay at the Paris for a work conference. I was pleasantly reminded why I love staying here so much. It has a quaint feel and isn't so overwhelming like some other hotels in the area. There are plenty of amenities yet, it's not too much. It's easy to navigate to your room when you need a break but you have enough opportunities for fun if you like something a bit smaller. The other plus is its location - it's easy to walk to other locations and get back to the hotel because of its central location. The rooms are clean and charming, and well-appointed. The restaurants are excellent, although I recommend reservations if you don't like to wait. The smaller concessions are also available if you need something quick. ",2
26380,"My second time staying at Swissotel Nankai Osaka.  I stayed here due to its location and service.  The room is spacious, very comfortable and clean.  The staffs are speaking good English.  It is right next to Namba train station but the sound proof is so good that you will not hear anything in the room.  Behind the hotel it is the walking shopping street and there are so many shops and restaurants.  I enjoyed staying here as I found it the most convenient place to stay.  Will definitely stay here again if I visit Osaka. As we have 10 pieces of luggage, the concierge was kind enough to pull our luggage to the namba train station where we caught the rapid train to go to the airport.",2
7506,The suites are large and comfortable. Kind and friendly staff. Note if you are staying for business the desk area in the suites is very small but adequate to put small laptop.  Great Farmers Market at the fountain on a Saturday morning.,2
48704,"This B&B is quite good, it's very tidy and the staff is friendly and helpful. However, if you book a room without a private bathroom, it might be a bit stressful in the mornings. I don't know how many people had to share the two bathrooms but at certain times it's almost impossible it get to the bathroom or the toilet (as they're in the bathroom). Also, I had a room next to the bathroom which meant that I woke up every morning at around 5a.m. to people having a shower who came home from partying or having to catch a flight in the morning. I heard ALL the bathroom/shower noises imaginable (someone farting, vomiting or cleaning their palate is not the nicest thing to wake up to). Anytime someone opened their door with a key I thought they were actually trying to pick my lock, which gave me almost a heart attack at 3 in the morning.  So, the rooms are very clean (unfortunately, the person cleaning the room also tidied up my stuff - which means, organizing my make-up/bottles, putting my shoes neatly under my bed etc and threw away half-full bottles of water), the staff is nice, the breakfast is okay. All in all - nothing bad to say about the accommodation, just the other guests kind of ruined my stay there.",2

Its near the mrt station so its quite convenient, near spas and chinatown and public buses to the touristy areas are very accessible.

59963,"I agree with the very positive comments expressed in previous reviews, for the same reasons. This is an excellent hotel. My room - a So Comfy Earth themed corner room was beautiful, with amazing views of the park and city. The pool was nice, and not too busy when I was there. The rooftop HiSo bar was a spectacular setting, and unlike some hotel “destination” bars I have been to, this felt like a really welcoming and inclusive space to enjoy a drink and a snack, both of which were reasonably priced for the quality and location. The hotel is well located, with some nice places to eat and drink in the evenings. Plenty of places are walkable or a short walk or taxi or Grab if the heat is too much (e.g. Smalls in Suan Phlu, the Sitting Room in Soi Si Bamphen, and Cactus and the Kitchen at Yen Akat if you want to get away from the standard Sathorn/Silom offer).  As noted by others, the staff are exceptional, and their service was illustrated admirably when I arrived at the hotel. I realised I had left a small bag on the aeroplane containing my wallet, credit cards and cash. I imagined a long and frustrating evening of calling the airline and explaining the situation, but the first person I saw at the hotel concierge desk immediately sought to assist. He took the flight details and seat number, called the airline, and by the time I was checked in, he had returned to say that the bag had been traced, and that he would arrange for it to be delivered to the hotel that night. Between the concierge, the check-in team, the hotel’s airport representative and the transport service, I thought this was an amazing bit of teamwork and made a real difference to my stay.  Thoroughly recommended, then, on all counts and I hope to return.  ",2

The breakfast could however be better: it is quite limited choice, with not very good selection, and with no changes over a few days. The room was also quite small.",2
43110,"I have stayed at almost all Oberoi Hotels & Resorts and love all of them. Wherever an Oberoi Hotels & Resorts property is, it has been natural for us to go with that for past many years. We stayed at The Oberoi Mumbai for 4 nights in July 2022. A wonderful hotel, unbeatable location, mind-blowing hospitality and a caring team. They make sure that all expectations are met, doesn't matter what. A special thanks to Mr. Amit Kaul, KK, Chef Bhamra, Shubham and Soham from Vetro. You won't find a better place to stay in Mumabi, doesn't matter how hard you try.  However, this was the end of our relation with Oberoi Hotels & Resorts. The reason is one and only Mr. Rajat Kumar Singh from Oberoi Contact Centre. He does everything exactly the opposite of Oberoi Dharma which puts the guest first, company second and the self last. We had a roughly 100 room nights reservation with Oberoi Hotels & Resorts for a family holiday. I had a deal in writing with him but closer to the dates, Mr. Rajat Kumar Singh went back on his words about key points which spoiled the whole experience for me. He is indeed ""a man of many words but not a man of his word"". The guy did everything possible to make sure that the important promises were not kept. This kind of shady practices do not suit a person who is appointed as Vice President in such a reputed organisation. I have all communication in writing.  But the hotels, GMs and staff are so wonderful that I keep sending my guests to these hotels when they are in India even though I have made myself a promise that I won't set my foot in any of their hotels until he is with the organisation. I hope my wait won't be too long.",2
66973,"Stayed on 3rd floor mixed dorm. No space really for storing luggage, but the terrace was amazing. The place was quiet, met cool people there. Mixed toilets and showers. Nice design. In heart of China town. Good food not far. Close to train station.  Nice staff.",2

44025,"We stayed here for 4 nights with our two kids (9 and 4 years). The location is excellent with a few mins walk to the Acropolis and Plaka. There is also many restaurants, launderette, mini marts etc within easy reach. The studio was large, bright and clean. Ours had a queen bed and 2 more foldable beds, small kitchenette and dining table. Ideal for family travel. The toilet was small, basic and could have done with a proper shower cubicle - instead of an open plan which results in the entire floor getting wet. While free wifi was available, it was slow, weak and had a cumbersome process to access it. With all of us carrying multiple devices, this is not ideal.",2
54973,"First of all, this is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great location Plaka.  Close to all the major sites in Athens.  The breakfast buffet was amazing and the rooftop views spectacular!  Beds were comfortable and the bathroom updated and tastefully done.  Two reasons I didn’t give this hotel a 5.  Our room was very small (tiny) with lousy views.  And the courtyard was still under construction so we didn’t get to enjoy that part of the property.  If we are fortunate enough to return, I would definitely upgrade to a larger room and make sure no construction was underway.  Overall, loved Electra Palace!",2

I was having breakfast at the Horizon Club Shangri La Jakarta and drop my cash while pulling out my mobile phone without me knowing. A short moment later, a Shangri La staff Azhim came over and handed me back my cash ever so politely saying sir i think you dropped this. This act of honesty goes a long way. Thanks again Azhim, u made my day for the kind gesture : )",2
3895,"The hotel is REALLY nice. Staff are very helpful, reception is lovely & the rooms are excellent.   The problem is the location. It’s way out from anywhere. You’re looking at €104 to get to the airport!! & about an hour travelling time on public transport to get to Milan centre. Including a fair bit of walking, buses, trams & trains.  This isn’t the hotel’s fault but if you want to be in & around the centre of Milan, this isn’t the place to stay.",2
9085,"The apartment is relative easy to find, and it is next to the Panathenaic Stadium. Rooms are clean, and tidy. Full Kitchen facilities provided, if you wish to cook or prepare your own meals. There is a small Supermarket nearby and small eateries in the vicinity.",2
23629,"We spent four wonderful nights at the Palladium home when we visited Athens. It's located on a vehicular-free plaza just minutes from the grounds of the Acropolis. Our room was cozy, well-appointed and quiet, with a balcony and a view of the plaza below and at least a half-dozen outdoor restaurants. We ate most and enjoyed them. You need to know it's a walk-up with no elevator, but the helpful staff assisted with our bags. And it's a block from taxis, but again, the hotel will arrange an easy pickup. Good breakfasts with Greek pastries and yogurt and juices.",2
43738,"The hotel is in the center of Fira, close to everything. Although you do not have a Caldera view, that was no issue for us. We rented a quad and were able to get to the best spots to view the sunset. To get there they promptly pick you at the port/airport and receive you with a glass of wine and all the maps and info you need to know to get around, including restaurants folders which give discount to the guests. Every morning they offer free coffee and that was really nice, makes you feel very comfortable around the place. The hotel has 2 pools, the room was really way over our expectations - we had a nice balcony, a complete kitche, very comfy bed. The only thing we could complain was the water in the shower which is salty, but looks like is the same all over Santorini. I'd definitely come back and recommend this place.",2
39987,"At first glance, the single room might seem small especially when you have a large suitcase like me. But the room is actually quite large for a single room, but for the presence of  a bulky chair and desk, the suitcase could have been easily stowed. Despite this, the room and attached shower had everything I needed. The wooden floor is beautiful.  The staff are very friendly and ready to help when you approach them. The breakfast is excellent quality (love the smoked salmon and 3 types of croissants), coffee divine, with a more than adequacy selection of foods for all. Unbeatable location, not too near the train station but an easy 10 min walk with luggage. There is even a small gym. The one negative is the aircon is noisy though I managed to sleep through it. It did stop in middle of night (thermostat?) but it wasnt that hot. Might be an issue in full summer though. Windows can be opened.  Overall, reasonable for expensive Milan. Would stay again.",2

39784,SOLARIA Hotel has 2 doorways both opening to extensive shopping and eating explorations... taxi can drop you off in front of the hotel only before 10 am.  The AIRPORT BUS TERMINAL is a leisure walk of 150 meters.  Very accessible if you booked a day excursion to Nami or Petite France because the meeting place is at a walking distance.  The new Daiso Korea building is just 2 blocks away.  UNIQLO is very near also.  You get to enjoy the Japanese TOTO TOILET comfort experience.,2
43041,"I've never stayed at this hotel before but I will definitely be staying there from now on when I visit Guangzhou.  The hotel is in a great location, near lots of shops, several restaurant and very close to the subway station.  The hotel is new and very clean.  The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.  I visited the Executive Lounge every evening I stayed at the hotel. They were so accommodating.  Elizabeth in the Executive Lounge was really kind and very helpful. She gave me suggestions on places that I could visit while I had some time off.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone - whether you're in Guangzhou for business or pleasure.  I look forward to my next stay there.  ",2
64143,We stayed there for 12 nights. It takes about 10 mins to walk to the MTR station from the hotel and even if it’s late at night there are still quite a lot of people walking around for those who are worried about whether it would be dangerous to walk around there at night. The staff were always quite nice and made us feel very welcomed. Always got the elevator ready for us when we entered the lobby. Helped us with the luggage both times and even got a taxi for us when we were heading to the airport. The size of the rooms were quite reasonable. My only complaint is sometimes I could hear next door’s alarm going off in the morning otherwise I thought everything was quite good as the hotel appears to be quite new and modern. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. ,2
3593,"We stayed 4 nights in standard room cost US$163. Yes. That includes breakfast too. The hotel decor is a bit bitten but good enough. Very clean. Big pool. Seldom is there a pool that quiet, that big. Shallow pool are situated on the outer sides. Good for a day of reading and resting by the pool. Hourly transfer to Kata beach for free. Walking distance to reasonably priced eatery. For budget travelling, highly recommended.",2
24479,"Stayed for three nights and couldn’t be more delighted with this hotel, which offers a continental breakfast, either included the price or you can add on when you arrive.  Absolutely beautiful apartments, very modern& spacious.  Although not in the city, there’s a regular bus into the city, no 57,  just opposite and the circular tram no 12,  if you turn right as you leave the hotel.  However, don’t forget to purchase your tickets before you board - all day tickets are the best value.    We did not eat breakfast in the hotel, but chose to eat in a little Italian bakery/cafe a bit further down the road on the opposite side to the right of the hotel. Can’t remember the name but it was on the corner a few blocks to the right of the hotel.  Suited us better as we were a large family group with children.  They loved the warm pastries and coffee - €35 for ten people!    However, from what I saw of the breakfast in the hotel, it did look very appetising.  A lovely little touch the hotel had on the evening was to put jars of sweets and other tasty goodies out for the children - or the adults if they wished.  There isn’t a bar as such but there was a bar menu at very reasonable prices.  Hotel staff were so friendly too, always smiling and helpful. On the night we arrived, we had booked previously to eat at the L’immagine Bistrot Ristorante, a lovely Italian Restaurant just up the road.  So pleased we did, it’s an amazing  place with a special atmosphere  - and more freebies too!!  I would highly recommend going there just for the experience!   The Milan Suite Hotel appears to be reinventing itself and it’s doing a pretty good job as far as I can see.  Very reasonable price for Milan and if you don’t mind being just that little bit out and in a more residential area, I’d certainly recommend it.  Only one thing to remember, if you do take public transport to return to your hotel, if it’s dark, you haven’t a clue where you are - but it’s very close to Radisson Blue as a landmark.  Enjoy, we loved it!   ",2

We were assisted by Marcus Lim from front office reception and greeted us with his big smile, so welcoming and friendly guy!

Kudos as well to all the staff from the Pool and medley buffet very accomodating and kind. Its really 10/10 overall rating! Indeed! We will visit again next year for our 10th anniversary!",2
1291,"We spent 5 days in the Lily Langtree suite and could not have found a more delightful place to stay in San Francisco. The Chateau is beautiful, quirky, classy and full of character.  The decor is fits the era and the whole feel is calm and dignified. Our suite was advertised as being ""in the basement"", but with the hilly nature of the area, we had windows at street level and our own private door onto the street. Even though the word ""suite"" was used when we booked, we expected, for the reasonable price we paid, to get a room and possibly a hallway, but we ended up with two bedrooms and two hallways ! The continental breakfasts were great and there was complimentary cheese and wine laid out in the reception rooms every afternoon - with the antique radiogram tuned to the classical station.   We did not stay long enough to sample the weekend champagne breakfasts, sadly. The B&B is near Alamo Square and the (now dull pastel) Painted Ladies. The #5 bus passes by regularly a half a block away and goes to town (Market Street) one way and the Botanical Gardens and Ocean View beach the other way.  Fillmore and its restuarants and jazz is a short walk down the hill and Divisadero street with its shops and coffee bars is a walk of several quite steep blocks the other way. The Chateau has free wi-fi, though the signal is only strong in the reception rooms.  We could get a signal from our toilet !   But there are plenty of chairs, tables and settees to settle into in the sitting room upstairs - with a glass of good wine if you choose your time right. On top of all this - the staff were wonderful.   Friendly, helpful, chatty, kind, full of suggestions.... They made the stay that much more special.  Thank you Meredith and Nick.  Beware.  There are no TV's in the B&B.  There suggestion is that if you need to be entertained, they have board games and plenty of books to read.  Somehow this made things even more specially and classy and got us out and about more than we might have done normally.  Top tip for San Francisco if you don't have a car:   Buy a visitor pass for the Muni transport. You pay $3 for a Clipper card and then load it with either a 1-day, 3-day or 7-day pass.  This means you can travel on all the buses, trams and trolleys, whenever you like.  It does not cover the BART (underground) however, but we never found the need to use this anyway.",2
42270,"Had an enjoyable stay whilst working in Hengqin for 10 days. The staff are very helpful and friendly.   A couple of negatives; you can't charge food in the Japanese restaurant, which was very annoying as my wallet was in my room. I had a bad smell in my room, the hotel moved me, but even in the second room I had the same smell coming in through the AC system. The hotel need to address this.   Food outlets in the hotel are generally good, but there is no proper bar, there used to be one which is now closed. ",2

14123,"Stayed at Amari from 25.03.23-29.03.23. Hotel is in very nice location at the end of Patong Beach, so it is nice and quite. Staff at Amari and very polite and courteous. Amari is set in different level so they do provide buggy service to go to Lobby and also take you to your rooms. They also run shuttle service to Patong town 3 times a day which is very handy. Breakfast at Amari is very nice and there is something for everyone. They also have juicing station where you can make your own juice at breakfast. Overall rooms are nice big, but it just needs to be fitted with better lighting as the lights in our room was very dull which they sorted it out for us. Cleaning standard of the rooms needs to be improved. As it is at the end of Patong Beach you can't use their beach much as it is very rocky, that is the only downside for Amari for me as i would like to seat on sandy beach which you can't do here. Overall it was a pleasant stay. ",2
3012,"I booked the hotel because of great reviews on tripadvisor. Well the hotel is pretty a bit of a maize with a lot of stairs (but there's also a lift !). The room was clean and big enough for just me. It is so close to everything - Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque and other museums (I do advise buying museum pass -85 TL you save not only money but also your time - no need for queuing;)) and trams. It's less than 8 minutes of walking. There's a local shop nearby (go up the hill on your left and then first turn right) so you can buy yourself water or whatever else you need. Restaurants and cafes are also within walking distance. Hotel staff is extremely helpful and polite - when I was ill they brought me medicines! Breakfast - you have a lot of a choice: and everything is delicious! It's impossible to leave the hotel hungry. I do advise trying a little bit of each dish! Just bear in mind that they do not provide toothbrush nor toothpaste. ",2

22966,"We just returned from our week-long honeymoon from Rome. :) We were aware the fact that the hotel was outside the city centre, we just did not expect that the public transportation is so badly organised in the capital. The metro ran appr. every 15 min. from Rebbibia, always full of people, we could not even stand cozily. There was no time schedule for the buses in the bus stops, so we always waited  a lot. :) As I have been working in a 5 star hotel in Hungary for 10 years I was a bit dissapointed that we did not  receive a small surprise from the hotel for our honeymoon.Our hotel always puts a small fruit plate or a bottle of champagne into the guest rooms for special occasions for our guests. Otherwise we really liked our room (our bed was very comfortable), we were really glad with the chambermaids. :) The breakfast staff was also very kind and helpful, altough the breakfast could have been more varied. Overall we enjoyed our stay in your hotel, and in the city of Eternal Love. :):) Thank you!",2

26971,"This was our first time staying at the Four Seasons. We live in Guangzhou and often do “staycations” in the city or nearby Shenzhen to relax and unwind. Having stayed at many of the nicest hotels (Jumeriah, Sofitel, Langham, Hilton, Ritz, etc.) we can easily say that our time at the Four Seasons was the most fantastic experience we have had in over five years living in China.  The staff made sure that every part of our stay was perfect — from the check in to our upgraded room, the exemplary service we received at Café Mondo and Tian Bar, and finally the check out as well. Sue, Camilla, Ivan, and also Antonio and Ariel from Tian Bar, all made us feel so welcomed and at ease. A friend of ours was visiting from Shenzhen and had a birthday, and the hotel went above and beyond to make that a special experience, with a cake, a handwritten card, a speaker for the room, and extra touches at the restaurant and the bar.  We loved everything about our stay and will be returning soon! ",2
50609,"We stayed here 4 nights in April 2019. Check in was fast and staff are polite and helpful. The room on the 9th floor had a beautiful view of the Seoul tower. The room was very clean and spacious and included a kettle and mini fridge, The location is amongst the best because it’s right beside Myeongdong station and in the heart of the shopping and eating district. Our day tour operator actually meets just outside Myeongdong station exit 2 which is just outside our door and the limo  bus from Incheon (6015) also stops within a 100 meters of the hotel. If I were to nitpick one thing, there was no buffet breakfast option even thought the website indicated it. There is only a set menu course. This was not a big deal since there are so many food options close by. We still stay here again, just excellent.",2

There was a continental breakfast of pastries, yogurt, fruit and coffee in the restaurant.  It wasn’t huge, but nicely done and felt fancy….not like wandering into the lobby of a Hampton inn etc.  you had the option to pay if you wanted eggs or something more. The staff was friendly.  There wasn’t a coffee pot in the room, which I missed, but there was great coffee served at the breakfast.  My biggest problem was the dirty bathrobe in the room, but that was probably just an oversight by the housekeeping crew.",2
38874,"I apologize in advance; this review is long overdue. I rented 8 of the 9 rooms at beautiful Prekas Apartments this past May when my daughter celebrated her nuptials. We live in Texas and the groom was from Australia.  We had guests and family converging on the beautiful village of Imerovigili from all corners of the globe. First off, let me say this it is not an easy task to try and book an entire hotel 6 months before your arrival date. After many failed attempts to contact other properties, I struck gold when I reached out to Nektarios, the owner of Prekas apartments. Mr. Prekas communicated with me very promptly via email and I was able to quickly book all rooms. Of course when we got very close to arrival, many of our guests needed to make adjustments to their reservations.  It was quite complex but Mr. Prekas was both patient and efficient in accommodating all the changes. The property itself is quite spectacular and as I anticipated, it became the main meeting spot for our wedding party of 40. We shared many meals and happy times during the week on the balcony of over the office. We even performed the wedding rehearsal on the roof of one of the rooms! I have to confess that we were a bit loud and made quite a mess on a few occasions. Thomas, who not only carried all our bags down the 200 or so steps from the parking area, also cleaned up after us with nothing but a nod and a kind word. Lastly, I have to personally thank Chryssa, she is not only one of the nicest most genuine people I have ever met, but she was an integral part of making our week at Prekas a dream.  Chryssa helped us rent scooters and 4 wheelers, helped with transportation and ordering food in from the best spots! Each room at Prekas is a unique gem and matched the exact needs of all of our quests.  The location is just perfect.  It is a way from the bustle and crowds of Thira, but just a short walk or 4 wheeler ride away to the action.  We had many young people in our group and they partied the nights away in Thira and always came back to the rest and relaxation of the Prekas Apartments. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Cheers to a great job! We will be back....without the other 38 people!",2

43404,"It took the taxi driver from the airport some time to find - but after three goes we arrived at the front door - on the edge of the street. The staff were very friendly - iced tea offered upon arrival. My room (a deluxe double) wasn't very big, but it had a charming balcony looking into the side alley, and a spotlessly clean bathroom. My bed was very firm, and very comfortable. The towels had been folded to look like elephants. I asked for a double (I'm tall and I sprawl), non-smoking, and I faced an alley between buildings. No view, but they'd strung up artificial creepers so it wasn't all concrete The street itself was very narrow, single car width plus a bit, and there were plenty of small eating houses offering delicious food. I tried three of them. All excellent, and very cheap. Five minutes' walk down the street and along the branch of a canal brought me to the sky train stop, and then one stop away heading east (15 Baht) was Saphan Taksin station - an ideal spot at which to catch the tourist boat upriver. I caught the boat up and down the river every day bar one - a great way to start and finish a day of sightseeing - looking at all the wonderful buildings, old and new, that border the Chao Praya, and looking at the teeming river traffic. And, of course, arriving back footsore and weary, there is plenty of street food near the station, the walk back to the hotel passes the 7-11 if you need anything, and then in a few minutes you're in a cool shower. Next time I go to Bangkok, I'll go there again. I had a very relaxing few days after a frantic time at work, and it was delightful. What did I like the least - the grubby water of the canal.",2
58946,"Alessandro the hotel owner was very kind and accommodating, nothing was ever too much trouble. A Continental Breakfast is served on a tray every morning and we chose to eat on our own little private terrace which was very peaceful and warm even in late September.  The hotel is very conveniently located and tastefully decorated. If you wish to walk everywhere, it is approximately a 20 to 25 minute walk to the Colisseum. Alternatively, Piramide metro station is not even a 5-minute walk away and this will get you into the city centre very quickly. You can travel up the line B to Termini and then switch to the line A, it's only 1.50 euros a ticket for 100 minutes and this saved our legs from a lot of walking.  The room was serviced every day and was absolutely spotless every time we came back in the evening. There is a multitude of restaurants and places to eat around the hotel, in particular Fratelli Mori which is on the same road as Althea Inn where we had an amazing meal. Alessandro also went out of his way to order us travel to the airport which completely took the stress out of travelling.  We would definitely recommend Althea Inn and will be coming back when we next visit Rome.",2

65132,"We visited here as the reviews had said that it was a friendly area and can completely agree. It’s off the main road down a side street so benefits from being in a quiet location, but is near enough to a big main street with lots of restaurants bars and sites.  The Moulin Rouge was a 15 minute walk and the hotel offered umbrellas as it was a rainy evening when we walked there from the hotel.  We also picked this hotel as there is a Metro station less than a 5 minute walk which we used a lot to get around. It’s about 5 or 10 minutes (on the metro) to the Champ Elyse and Arc de Triumph.  The room was spacious enough and had a fridge and all the other amenities you’d expect and the hotel staff spoke perfect english which was great as we only spoke a little french.  Would consider again if we returned to Paris, but bear in mind that the hotel is outside of the centre of Paris so travel is needed with taxis or Metro if you wanted to go to the likes of the Eiffel Tower (if you didn’t fancy an hour walk!)",2
24169,"For me, the most important part of quarantine should be the everyday meals since we cannot go out at all, and I was truly satisfied with the taste and quality of the food that Dorsett provided. It was also very generous for Dorsett to provide us some complementary drinks. The room was clean and basic supplies and necessities were just right. Quarantine was boring but Dorsett made my stay a lot easier.",2
995,"My new favourite in Athens!  On Monday I decided to treat myself to Athens Backpackers in the luxurious district around the Akropoli. It's not that much more expensive than the far less glamorous options in Omonia but is WELL worth it. And when you factor in the free breakfast - it might even work out the same price anyway.   Most of Athens's hostels are in Omonia which is quite a functional and boring bit of Athens that feels somewhat unsafe at night.   This is one of the few exceptions - the area is posh. It looks kind of like an Cycladean island in terms of architecture and little boutiques/ craft shops.  Other things I found really cool include:  -The staff (a pleasant family from Athens via Sunderland) were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout my stay -They are generous with space in the dorms. By which I mean that they don't try and cram it with beds to maximise profits) I felt like I actually had room for my stuff and could walk around -Nice and warm! Sounds weird but the place I was in before in Athens was freezing - The lay-out facilitates (but doesn't demand) socialising; there is a pleasant living room with a kitchen and a quieter sort of ""snug"" bit upstairs. The living room is right by the entrance which gives it a friendly vibe as there are people knocking about most of the time immediately as you come in. A fine range of beers was certainly appreciated too! -AMAZING book swap! With about 6 different languages filling a whole book case. -You can walk around at night without feeling unsafe -Breakfast is free and you get a generous range of stuff",2
58312,"Overall, okay for a hotel in general. In the first room that I got, the heater was too loud because of its proximity to the bed. Had the room changed with no problems. The internet worked with no issues. However, later on I discovered that I had been charged for premium internet on Day 3 of my stay. Am not sure how it could have happened since after my first login, I only kept confirming settings. The hotel was happy to refund though. The breakfast options were terrible for a Marriott, IMHO. Everything prepacked, with huge amounts of sugar. The only non-sugary items were prepacked sausage biscuits. For some reason, they didn’t even have bananas for the first couple of days. Despite the notice about wearing face coverings inside the elevator (as well as in other places), a cleaning lady rode in the elevator right next to me with none at all (and we were both looking right at this notice on the elevator door). The lady at the reception had hers only on the mouth.",2
4222,"My wife and I spent 2 days at the Pan Pacific (visiting the wonderful sights of Suzhou - whatever else you do visit the new city museum, it is absolutely outstanding).  The hotel gives a wonderful impression on arrival. It’s design is in keeping with the Suzhou old city style (white walls, black roof tiles) and has the feel and look of a pagoda. It nestled against the grounds of one of the main gardens (gates) in the city.  The rooms though feel a little tired/old. They are clean and reasonably well appointed, but showing signs of age (doors to wardrobes don’t quite fit, the room safe didn’t work, the furniture corners were slightly damaged, etc). Perhaps slightly more disappointing was the feeling that there was lack of staff in the various areas of the hotel. The bar was poorly staffed, the breakfast sitting was short of staff (no offer of tea/coffee, dishes not cleared, places not always laid) ... that said the food was very good and the selection wide.  It was an enjoyable stay ..... but just a little more attention to detail and it would have been an excellent stay. ",2
6838,"We stayed the night in Osaka and were looking for convenient hotel after staying 3 nights in a row in Ryokans. We had rather low expectations of this hotel due to the price. However, arriving there we were rather surprised finding a very modern and new hotel. Although they do not have WIFI in every room, the hotel will provide you which a router you can setup yourself (takes less than 2 minutes). The rooms and bathroom are big for japanese hotel. I will stay there again next time I will be in Osaka",2
30387,This hotel is well located to enjoy everything San Fransisco has to offer. A 25 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf or 40 minutes to Haight Ashbury. The looks in the hotel is a  very good mix of authentic and modern styles. Amenities provided in the hotelroom are top class including waterbottles which can be used while exploring the city. Conclusion: We had a great stay in this hotel.,2
41009,"First time in Milan but Bernie our Concierge was attentive as soon as we checked in.  He helped get our room quickly and had furniture removed (small junior suite for family of 4).  Next day he arranged for a quick tour bus trip and arranged for our dinner.  He knew all the times, shortcuts and logistics to make our trip in Milan the best possible.  Also Marco our bartender was very friendly!  Can’t wait to come back and get pampered.  Cifuentes family 2019.",2
44653,Lovely setting right on the river. Comfortable rooms overlooking the gardens. The restaurant is on a terrace right by the river and Breakfast which was excellent and our evening meal were taken there. The half board option is very good value as for the main course in the evening you are able to pick from the menu. We found the food very good and varied. There is also an indoor restaurant for colder weather. The location is excellent as only a short walk to the beach and about 15 minutes to the centre of the small town of Agva. The hotel also has a good size car park and a swimming pool. All the staff were very pleasant and friendly.,2
43093,"I was in Bombay for work and instead of living close to workplace, I stayed 1 hour away at the Oberoi Mumbai. And I can gladly say I made the right choice. My room was very comfortable kept by the excellent housekeeping team who adhered to all my small and big requests. Room upkeep was excellent stacked with cleanest sheets, towels, pillows which guaranteed a comfortable sleep every night. The breakfast was full of options and the staff was very prompt in service.   The bar area has the finest views of the bay.   Ziva restaurant is serving modern and fine Indian food with a twist. I had the charcoal prawns, mutton Roghan josh and the dodha dessert. All dishes very very good.   The only downside I faced at the hotel was at the time of check out. Check out took forever. The vouchers given the prior night were not entered in the system and were no where to be found. Hence I had to arrange for soft copies again. My invoices are yet to be received on email which I was promised at check out just like any other Oberoi Hotel.   Hence the 4 star review.",2
12064,"There is a lot to chose from in Bangkok but we went for this small B&B to end our vacation in Thailand. It is an extraordinary antique house beautifully preserved in the hearth of the city. The rooms are big and charming and the staff was very helpful and nice, it is a bit noise due to the proximity of 2 big highways but you quickly forget about once inside the house. The breakfast was very good and the staff accommodated to our preferences, also nice was the fact that you could have a cup of tea at any time and that they have an exchange library.",2
16122,"Stayed there through a reference. Had wonderful time!  Right from the moment I stepped in, felt almost at home. Yeah the room I chose, was possibly the smallest, but then it was my choice, and it was just about fine for a solo traveller. Stefano is a rockstar. We almost spent an hour on the first day pondering over the map he provided me. And I followed the exact path he had suggested. Next day, repeat ! Another round of discussions and another day to explore. He was extremely helpful when I called him many times over the day.  Breakfast is good. Decent spread. Not to forget his support staff. The lady who originally hails from Sri Lanka, and manages Breakfast and house keeping made sure I had a wonderful stay there! Kudos to them.  Rooms are just fine, if you are not looking for luxury, this is just perfect. Location, slightly away from the city buzz, but a quick bus hop will take you directly to the main tourist spots. Supermarket bang across the road. Do buy groceries and wine from there.  M definitely staying there again, when I go back. And, I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends.  Cheers !",2
6184,"On the positive side, the property was clean, near major roadways,  and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  However, our room was not ready until 1 1/2 hours after check-in time. I understand many places are short staffed right now but then you need to inform your guests if there is an issue with timely check-in.....  We were offered early check in on the app.and accepted knowing we would be in the area a bit early. We arrived 1/2 hour before check-in time, hoping out room was ready but fully understanding it probably wasn't, since we hadn't been notified of it's availability.  It wasn't ready so we left to get something to eat and returned 1/2 hour after check-in time. At that point we had to wait an additional hour for our room. With evening plans looming ever closer, my stress levels were rising and that was not how I wanted to begin my vacation.  Offering us a drink was nice but it didn't help with the fact that we needed our room in order to get ready for the evening.  Once in our room, it was clean  and spacious but the air-conditioner unit was  very loud. We got use to  it, but that might bother some people.  Also, if you are concerned about COVID protocols, this property may not be the best choice for you. Many of the staff do not wear masks and the breakfast buffet is self serve, with all guests using the same serving utinsils. They have hand sanitizer out but not many people use it.",2
52039,"Very good quality service with SPA and GYM  access during the whole day. Convenient location, 10-15 minutes by metro from the city ceter. Friendly stuff. Will definitely consider the place for the next stay.",2
66316,"The deluxe room was ample size  with a very comfortable king size bed. Room was clean, plenty wardrobe and desk space. Plugs aplenty and black out curtains, coffee making facilities and the shower was good, although the glass panel was not large enough so water kept spraying on to the floor. And I had to call for maintenace on three occasions to fix the plug over two weeks. They did apologise and sent a friut and chocolate tray. These were minor issues overall.   Breakfast at the Market Place was fantastic and the choices were a lot. Something for everyone. Shout out to the morning staff who  were excellent and always in good cheer. I did not eat during the day or night so cannot say what the service was like. Had room service a couple times and the food was good. There is a Starbucks which also has some nice chocolate and a ice cream bar.  There is a pool bar where people smoke the shisha bars and you can order food. At the time we could not use the pool (as women) because they had also erected a massive screen for the World Cup.  The decor was ok and areas by the lifts are spacious. Would I stay again- yes",2
2950,"My wife and I stayed for 12 days from the 27th July. Details of our stay are below but in summary we wouldn't return to this hotel for 2 main reasons - the pool lounger situation and the service. There are some good qualities to the hotel but the downsides outweigh them to the extent that it affected the enjoyment of the holiday. Not something I'd expect from the Hilton chain.  Room - Good Spacious, modern and has everything you need. Shower is excellent. We had full pool view and partial sea view and it was very nice. We did have to call reception on 4 occasions as our fridge/water hadn't been replenished but they came to rectify pretty quickly. Our housekeeper was very good, It was our wedding anniversary on our 2nd day and she did us a lively arrangement with our cards and towels (and she was excellent throughout our stay).  Pool - Not good The TUI description says it's a lagoon but it looks way bigger on the pictures than it is in reality. That said, it's clean and the quirky levels are nice. The shallow bit gets warm from about 1pm though so not really a refreshing escape from the heat.  The real problem is the sun lounger situation. If you don't get up and put your towel down by 8am you're either not going to get one or all that's left are broken ones (of which there are a few). This is a really annoying practice that hotels I've stayed in previously have banned, which they should do here too. The hotel is at capacity at the minute and the pool area suffered the most noticeably as a result. To be fair to the people 'securing' the loungers - if no-one is stopping you, what are you going to do if there are nowhere near enough for a full hotel? Annoying none the less and meant either me or my wife getting up at 7am on pool days and joining the rat race. Even more annoying that a lot of them just go unused for large parts of the day, but they have towels on 'just in case'.  Beach/Pier Bungalows - Excellent We used the beach once and loungers are much more abundant. The beach is shingle but not sharp - I preferred it to sand as it doesn't get everywhere and it means the sea is clearer as there's less getting dragged up when people walk in and out. The sea is crystal clear and very refreshing. The standout around the beach area are the bungalows on the pier. For €100 a day you get one to yourself with a massive sofa, loungers, a constantly stocked fridge, fruit/nuts brought to you, steps into the sea and they even bring you your choice of lunch from the food trucks. We did it twice and it was probably the highlight of the holiday.  Food - Excellent Breakfast is pretty standard as all inclusives go. All very palatable and a good variety. Lunch is where this hotel shines. There are 10 (I think) food trucks serving all sorts - burgers, tacos, noodles, jacket spuds, kebabs, pizzas, pasta, seafood and waffles (I've probably missed a few too). The burgers are especially good. Then there's also standard buffet lunch stuff too. Evenings are themed - Turkish, seafood, BBQ etc. There's always a wide variety and everything is cooked well. There's also a coffee shop which does cakes etc.   Drinks - Good Everything you'd expect. Local beers and spirits but if you ask for brands you will get them. And if you build a bit of a rapport  with some of the barmen (i.e. be friendly, say please and thanks...which a large % of the guests weren't doing when we were there) they give you them by default. There are plenty of places to get a drink. I would recommend George's bar (Menderes is a lovely bloke who you can have a conversation and a laugh with) and the cocktail bar overlooking the beach (Mahsun is also a lovely bloke). Lobby bar is open 24 hours which is good.  Entertainment - OK Non-existant in the day barring a pool assault course on a Saturday morning and darts at 3pm. Night is very samey but overall not too bad.  Grounds - Good Plenty of places to sit and chill, or get a drink, or get food etc. All very well kept.  Service/Staff - Poor As above, George's and the cocktail bar are excellent places to get a drink because of the two barmen Menderes and Mahsun - they are credits to the hotel and should be used as examples of what (very) good looks like. Apart from that, the service is really poor and most of the staff walk around like they've had their souls forceably removed from their bodies. There are a couple of exceptions dotted around - Emin who works on the lunch buffet outside, the entertainment guy (despite supporting Everton) and the Pier Manager but they are few and far between from a staff of 100+. The main restaurant is very haphazardly operated to day the least. There are quite a few staff members milling about but they're not really doing anything useful most of the time, e.g. focusing on refilling napkin holders rather than laying cutlery or offering a drink. We waited 5-10 mins on numerous occasion before being offered a drink. They also do really annoying things which seem counter intuitive and make the service problem worse, for example only giving you a third of a glass of water so you have to try to get their attention 5 minutes later to ask them to fill you back up. As mentioned the hotel was at capacity and it really showed in the evening - I think at this time of year extending the sitting by 30-60mins would help (along with staff being more effecient). The Ibiza Lounge where the evening entertainment happens is a joke - the male barmen only serve women or the Turkish guests. My wife got the drinks when we went there... The lobby bar is similar to the restaurant, there are enough people but no-one really asks you if you want a drink, they'll make eye contact and smile but just go about their business if you don't say anything. As stated we had to call reception a couple of times - their English wasn't great overall so it could be difficult to get your point across. Then again I don't speak Turkish either so can't judge that too much.  Other Wifi is excellent throughout, even extending to the edge of the pier. At the time we stayed the guests skewed heavily Eastern European and Turkish. Not a problem in the slightest for us but something to bear in mind if you like a hotel full of Brits to talk to about how the weather is back home.",2
31067,This was our hotel of choice when staying in Vegas for 10 nights last May. It was in a perfect location for us (mid strip) and we absolutely loved it. The room was very spacious and clean and we managed to upgrade on check-in to a jacuzzi bath tub which was lovely! The pool area was spacious and not over crowded although half the pool was shut off throughout our stay. The hotel had loads of options for food and drink and plenty of casino activities and entertainment right below us. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. If staying in the right rooms you would have an amazing view of the Ballargio fountains across the road from Paris.,2
8210,"This is a very belated review but we feel fairly confident in that nothing would have changed for the worse.  We stayed here as a group of three adults and one four year old for six nights in August 2022, booking directly with the hotel as it offered the best price. We also booked transportation from the airport and to the hotel. Note that the transportation is a cash only service. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with a sofa-bed.  This is a serviced apartment located opposite the Mosaic hotel, at which check-in is done - luggage can be stored with the hotel if arriving prior to check-in. Once checked in, the entrance to the serviced apartment is only some 20m from the hotel. A lift is available on the first floor so make sure you're comfortable carrying your own luggage.  The building and apartment was impeccably clean and quiet. The apartment felt incredibly spacious with an air conditioner in the main area. It featured a kitchen, dischwasher as well as cooking utensils and crockery. This isn't even criticism but given everything was so perfectly arranged, it felt odd that there was such a lack of dishwashing tablets when they had even thought of providing bubble bath.  The location is very convenient and it felt like you were close to everything, which made things easier when travelling with a four year old. There are plenty of grocery stores nearby and a fantastic bakery called Artic Bakehouse across the road, which became part of the morning routine as we'd walk across and buy fresh bread as well as coffee.  Would definitely stay here again.",2
52198,"This is our first time to stay at Hilton.  We attended a wedding so we decided to stay overnight.  We loved the room given to us.  The food at Kusina was also good.  Nino and Athena, who took us to our seat, assisted and served us were both courteous and nice.  What I just did not like was the one who was at the front assigned at Kusina.  I asked for her name as she was a bit rude and unaccommodating.  When I was asking a question, she smirked. Her name was Macky.  It was good Athena was there and was all smiles and assisted us.",2

49060,"Returning to the Moon Palace the Grand after a previous visit, we were reminded of why this hotel has become our favorite vacation spot in Mexico. This time around, we booked a 7-night stay to celebrate my 40th birthday, and we were once again enamored by its impressive range of restaurants and warm hospitality.  Our party consisted of 4 people - 2 adults and 2 children under 10, and the Moon Palace catered to us all with aplomb. One of the standout features of our stay was the resort's modern approach to guest communication. They use a business WhatsApp account to handle guest inquiries and requests, meaning that we didn't have to physically visit the lobby for every minor query or request.  The resort also has an excellent mobile app that adds a level of convenience that few other hotels can match. From this app, we were able to order room service, request extra bedding for our kids, and make restaurant reservations. This combination of traditional hospitality and modern amenities made our stay seamless and enjoyable.  Among the staff, Gabriela Rangel at the lobby deserves special mention for going above and beyond to make our stay memorable. She arranged themed decorations in our room to celebrate my birthday, complete with personalized touches. The staff even sang ""Happy Birthday"" to me at the restaurant in the evening - a special memory I will treasure.  However, our stay was not without a few hiccups. There appeared to be a staff strike during our visit, and the restaurant service wasn't up to its usual standards. Despite this, the food remained exceptional, with the exception of the Brazilian Rodízio. As a Brazilian, I found the food there not representative of true Brazilian cuisine, and the quality of the meat was disappointing.  On the other hand, our favorite restaurants were the Indian and the Mediterranean, which served up delightful fare every time. The breakfast buffet was another highlight, with its variety of fresh fruits, juices, and hot breakfast items like pancakes and waffles.  In terms of entertainment, the Moon Palace the Grand certainly does not disappoint. They offer activities for the whole family, including live bands during the day and a foam party, which was an absolute hit with our kids.  One point of contention, however, was the situation with poolside towels. Many guests reserved seats with their towels, which made it difficult to find an available spot. This is an area that the resort could certainly improve.  All in all, having recently stayed at a more expensive resort, we can confidently vouch for the value and enjoyment Moon Palace the Grand offers. It remains our top choice for a family vacation in Mexico. While there's always room for improvement, this resort truly sets a high standard in hospitality.",2

It is an art lovers paradise.  This hotel is classified as 3 star superior - this is way too low a classification.  It goes above and beyond in every sense.  I am someone who finds fault in every hotel, but in this one...nothing.  Possibly the only niggle was the size of the bedrooms, but the space in the building is confined and they do the best they can with it.  That said, I didn't go to Barcelona to spend the day in my bedroom, so it served it's purpose.  Would I stay here again? Happily!",2

24853,Visited this hotel in March 2023 and was quite impressed with it. Welcomed by the front desk as soon as we reached. Rooms were ready pretty quickly despite it only being about 130pm. Very happy that they checked us in smoothly.   A clean and comfortable room. Quite spacious. Love the beds( noticed after that they merged 2 single beds) as it was comfortable with good pillows. Hard to find hotels with good pillows these days. Only thing is it’s noticeable that the hotel is starting to get old.  But overall pretty happy with it.   Breakfast was okay. The standard works. But the juice station was a plus. Had some issues on the 1st day where a random couple suddenly took our table (guess the seats were nice?) when we went about taking our food. But it was all sorted out quickly as I moved to the other.   Did not manage to swim by the pool as it was always crowded. But was quite happy with the hotel.,2

62921,"We only stayed one night in this wonderful atmospheric and historic hotel but we will certainly be back. It is beautifully decorated and very elegant. My wife was particularly taken with the ikebana arrangements throughout. Also there is much artwork worthy of a stroll around the corridors.   I see one reviewer has mentioned the sound of trains on the Maranouchi side. You do hear the distant rumble of the Shinkensen when they start running early in the morning but this is very faint indeed, and it is a iconic sound of Tokyo.  Special points are:  The staff are wonderful and attentive. Thank you so much!  You can't get any more central to Ginza than this, and there is Kitchen Street inside the station (1F Nihombashi Gate) for a range of informal dining options.   They will arrange a limo to take you to Haneda at a very reasonable price.  Where they might improve:  Our room was small (there was no room on one side of the bed for a bedside table). There was a large heavy armchair taking up a lot of space. This could be removed. Next time we will upgrade to a larger room.  We had a couple of hours between check-out and our limo but there is no lounge just to sit in. The lounge area seems to be reserved for lunch and afternoon tea. Some seats should be set aside for guests in our position.   Overall we are very happy to give this hotel 5 stars.  ",2
60883,We had a great stay at the metro. Parking was a bit of a pain but we were able to find some free on-street parking within a couple blocks. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for any needs we had. Our room was tiny but comfortable. My only complaint was the lack of coffee maker in the room or lobby. Be prepared to hit a coffee shop nearby if you need your morning fix! Excellent location to many restaurants & shops in and around the Haight. ,2
46767,"A wonderful and relaxing stay Chatrium riverside. We stayed i in Thailand for the 45 days allowed by the visa. We traveled outside of Thailand to Cambodia and Hong Kong and returned to Chatrium Riverside for another extended stay this has been our hotel of choice for over 10 years but we have stayed over the years at other hotels along the river, the the river. We opt for the Buffet breakfast and room overlooking the river. Ms Mathurose. The resident manager,  arranged our reservations which we a bit complicated. Daughter and family joined us there as well   Our room was so very clean and everything was perfect. Ms. Kuakul the housekeeping supervisor did an outstanding job keeping up the reputation of Chatrium hotels. All of the rooms have a balcony overlooking either Chaopyra river or the city. The shuttle boat takes you to Central pier where you can get BTS monorail or connect to other hotel Shuttle boats. Robinson department store is close by pier and has a large supermarket in the basement. We have enjoyed the weekend evening seafood buffet and the Dim Sum weekend lunch at the hotel. Icon Siam mall is right on the river too it has 500 stores and 100 restaurants. Shuttle boats are free and run from Central pier. A ten minute boat ride. Ms Rawiwan, restaurant and bars manager.

24324,The hotel is new It was my second stay at this hotel. I stayed in a one bedroom apartment which is very spacious with a bedroom a living room dining and kitchen area a balcony and 1 full bathroom + 1 toilet. The facilities are very good in the apartment and it is value for money. There are 2 televisions. This time I had issues watching youtube on the tv. They could rectify it.I also received complimentary breakfast which was good. The restaurant gets very crowded between 930-1030am but the staff manage well. The breakfast offering is well spread. The location of the hotel is convenient with 2 metro stations within a 7 min walk. Union for red line+green line and Salah AL Deen for the green line which is very convenient. There is a mall with Carrefour right opposite the hotel. A masjid next door and a supermarket within the hotel complex. The Naïf Souq and Gold Souq is within a 15 min walk and everything else can be reached via the metro lines. As the hotel is located in a busy locality getting a taxi could be an hassle especially during peak hours and also the traffic gets worse during the evening between 6-8pm as there are 2 major traffic lights on either side of the hotel so if you have a flight to catch during the evening plan well ahead as getting a taxi is difficult and once you get it getting out of the area will take a long time due to the traffic. Otherwise if you don’t have many bags metro is the best option.  Overall it is a very good hotel and the apartments are very comfortable for a longer stay. The pricing is very reasonable comapared to other hotels in Dubai.,2
59374,I boker a room for my sister for one night before her surgery. She's leaving out of Bucharest and come specially for the surgery.  I called the reception and asked if will be possible to use my credit card for all the expenses. Unfortunately I don't remember the person that answered to the phone but he advised me to send an email. I sent  the  email and Daniel replied back that everything is set. Thank you again!!,2
43921,We stayed here for 3 nights and were quite happy about the stay. The location is great - so central to everything. We had to large bedrooms and nice bathrooms. The apartment was clean except the bathroom floors had some stains and the dishwasher was very dirty and with bad odour. Our bedrooms were next to a noisy street with a lot of shouting and racing motorbikes which was a bit enoying.,2
18309,The staff at the hotel was very helpful. They made my stay very enjoyable. There are two employees who were exceptional in their job. The first was a tall male and wore a bowtie every day working the front desk. The second was a young white lady working the breakfast area. Because of these employees and their coworkers my stay in Paris was fantastic.,2
7266,It was our post Birtday celebration. Myself. My husband and my daughter. My children enjoy the  private villa pool. The villa is very spacious. Everthing was great.  Highly recommended Thank you…………..,2
12332,"Rooms are smaller than they appear in the photos, but our outdoor deck overlooking the acropolis could not be beat! The location was perfect as well. Use the elevator to go up and the stairs to go down. Reception very helpful and friendly.",2
36785,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the hospitality and room. While it was not right in Downtown Rome, the short drive to the train station (a few minutes) and quick train ride into the Flaminio station made this hotel perfect for the beginning of our 3 week driving trip through Italy and Croatia. The service and English speaking assistance made our stay very enjoyable- the hotel breakfast was alsoreally good. Would stay there again.",2
60410,"Location - a very short 7min walk to the heart of Myeongdong. Near 2 train stations. Lots of restaurants & a nice cafe ""Luft Coffee"" around the corner. Convenience store a minute away. Personally I'd rather stay here, away from the lights & noise of Myeongdong. You could take the Airport Limousine (no.6015/6001) directly to T-mark hotel & a very short walk to G2 Hotel.It wasn't a hassle at all with our 2 big & heavy luggage bags. You could also take the public train from Incheon airport to Seoul station & transfer to either Chungmuro/Euljiro 3-ga station.  G2 Hotel - Top class. The staff are incredibly polite & helpful, all of them spoke fluent English. Reception is open 24hrs. And that marble interior at the reception area, so lush & beautiful!  The room itself was sparkling clean, especially the toilet. It felt like we came back to a new room everyday after house keeping. Everything looked brand new (this hotel is apparently 2 years old). They provided Innisfree toiletries which is a bonus, hair dryer, coffee & tea, kettle, mini fridge, TV, hangers. We really appreciated the heater/air conditioner in the room. It was a cold 0 degree Celsius outside but the room was nice & cozy at our selected temperature of 20. This feature is what older hotels in the heart of Myeongdong lacked, a lot of those hotels have centralized air conditioning that doesn't allow you to alter the temperature of the room. G2 hotel has a controller built into the wall, so you can increase/decrease the temperature as you please.  Rooms are quiet, because you're away from the heart of Myeongdong's chaos, you'll get yourself a quiet night's sleep. Blackout curtains allowed us to sleep in a little longer too.   I really have nothing but high praises for G2 hotel. I would book this hotel again in a heartbeat on our next trip back to Seoul.",2
17397,"Hotel Mala Strana is a great hotel in an excellent location. There are more shops near the hotel and a tram stop with many trams is also available in a few minutes walk. The Kampa Island, the Petrin hill, the  Charles Bridge and the Prague Castle is also close to the hotel.",2
63482,"I stayed for 9 night during my trip last April. At first, it is a bit difficult to find the entrance from bus stop. But it is not a big problem. I love the room. The bed was so confortable until it is hard for me to wake early. The room was clean, with shower, microwave to warm my breakfast. There is washing machine in basement for free but since no drier, i dried my laundry either in bathroom or i went to the nearest coin laundry (3500KRW for 30mnt ).  I will certainly back again for sure. ",2
27304,Nothing compares to this property and the level of service. We have been to many other all inclusive resorts all others fall short to Hyatt Ziva Cancun. This is truly a 5 Star Resort!!!! This was our 5 trip here and we will continue to come back. ,2
24395,"The 4 star with 5 star amenities, and world class service. Was initially taken aback by the simplicity of the g=hotel. It is indeed a 4 star hotel with 5 star benefits.  The rooms are squeaky clean with temperature control very easy to manage. A lot of DIYs, as there is no obvious concierge, though all requests can be handled by the brilliant english-speaking receptionists.",2
10381, Hotel stands on nice location with great service. All the requests from me had been replied in a short time. The amazing part is we can choose room-cleaning time. And won’t be bothered by staffs even stay in bed all day      ,2
53809,"I go to stay at Ambassador Hotel around 2-3 days ago,I check in with Miss Atcharaporn she is a staff at reception.She have a very good service,give some many information to me about travel around hotel.I so happy to choose this hotel for stay in my vacation.I will go back to this hotel soon.",2
39071,"We booked a 2 bedroom apartment. I could have given a 5 rating but we're still being asked to pay an additional charge for a roll away bed despite the fact that the reservation made was for 5 people with a rate given for 5 person occupancy. Anyway, it was a spacious apartment, 1 bedroom has 2 twin beds with the bathroom in the hall while the master bedroom has a king bed with an ensuite bathroom. Lots of towels were given plus the usual shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/lotion amenities. Kitchen was equipped. There's also a welcome basket of 2 bottles water, tea sachets and coffee/milo mixes. Plus a couple of cookie packs. Tap water is potable in Singapore. Internet access was not really good at times. I saw some people's bad comments on the breakfast, however, we find the offering reasonable and good. The coffee machines give freshly ground coffee with good selection, the same with the tea. There's a good choice of bread (I just wished the servers don't mix day old croissants to fresh ones), cereals and fresh cut fruits. Reception desk staff were helpful. I still think that treating staff with kindness and respect gets me the same response from them. There's a free shuttle bus that serves places of importance and it also brings guests to MRT stations. The driver of the bus was very prompt, pleasant and helpful.",2
5678,"We have just returned from 3 weeks in the Burgas Beach Hotel and will be booking to return next year. Everything was even better than last year and although we were 2 of only 4 English visitors, this caused no problems. The other couple also told us they will be returning next year. The staff, food, rooms, and cleanliness were of the usual high standard and this year saw the addition of 3 new pools. Two of these were for children and one for adults. There is also a poolside bar and plenty of sunbeds as well as tables and chairs. This area also has a disabled access. We still cannot fault the Burgas Beach itself, but this visit was not as enjoyable as usual because of an influx of Hungarian visitors. They treat the dining room as a 2 star by wearing vests, shorts, and flipflops and drinking beer at breakfast, and not bothering to control unruly children. This is such a shame when the hotel definitely is a 4 star and the staff work so hard to maintain these standards. Cant wait to go back.",2
11038,Stayed here as was supposed to be a 15 minute walk to Royal Albert Hall for an event but is quite a long way if you have problem walking and in the heat.  Brilliant distance from Gloucester Road tube station with very frequent tubes to King's Cross.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Were given room 570 room itself was ok for one night  but bathroom smelt fusty and actually saw a silverfish insect on the towel that was left on the bath which shows a sign of damp as it is in the basement not a good view outside. Whether we were given this room as we booked through Hotels.com and not direct through hotel not sure but certainly wasn't worth the just over £160 paid for 1 night. Very small bathroom and couldn't use bath or shower as glass door doesn't open fully to be able to get in and out if you have mobility problems. Suppose we should have mentioned this on booking information?  Be careful when booking other than through the hotel as although we could book a room with or without breakfast it does only include a continental breakfast which was quite adequate and plentiful - lovely tasting strawberries!  We are not regular London visitors anything to stay away really so unlikely to come back in any event but would probably book a Premier inn if needs mist again.,2
54113,"Room Super like this boutique hotel.  Bed is on platform. Bed is hard not soft, which is fine for me. I like to sit on the platform rather than the chair in the room.  The hairdryer is on the wall of the bathroom.  I stayed on the highest floor.  The water pressure is good.  Hot water is good.   The towel size is normal.  Some tripadvisor forum says that the some hotels provide very small hotel towels.   This hotel towels are normal size.  There is no air-con, only heater.  So I had to open the window slightly.  Location Fantastic location.  Purple line exit 4 is just in front.  If travelling by train to hotel, follow the guide from the hotel website.   Don't stop at Seoul Station, stop at Gongdeok station.  There is both upward and downward escalator at this exit.   There are escalators all the way through so I didnt have difficulty managing my 17kg luggage.  If going to Seoul station, reception will recommend exit 3.  There is no escalator at this exit.  The one with lift is at exit 7, which is just across the street.  The area has a number of food places and tent food stall that open till late.  So may be noisy for some people.  Drivers in Seoul like to honk.  The location is on a small street so this wasn't a problem.",2

20055,"Nice little hotel, very charming, perfectly situated on a quiet little street literally 2 to 5 mins from every thing you need including the RER (subway). Surrounded by tons of terraces and typical bistros and cafés. The room was on the small side but super clean as was the toilet. I’ve been travelling a bit, Europe, USA, Asia and South America, I have never met a staff more pleasant and service oriented. I have to be back in Paris in June, guess where I have booked the room. I highly recommande this quaint little hotel.",2
4772,"Stays here 2 times in 2020.   Pros: great location only a 5 min walk from the Central station. Close to lots of restaurants, bars, a grocery store, etc. Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. Furniture is fairly new and looks good. Water pressure in showers is good and their iron and iron board are good as well. All of their staff is friendly and polite. Breakfast buffet has a good choice of options.   Cons: Their lunch/dinner menu is really bad - choices are basic and not many healthy options on there. Area where the computer desk/working station is located in the rooms are dark even with all lights on. It makes it difficult to work there.",2
49004,"After years living nearby this place, I finally got a chance to stay here during a business trip from overseas.  It's basically the oldest/most prestigiious hotel in Guangzhou, and despite it's age, and location in the ""old"" part of town, it's still clearly very popular.  I was thrilled to be able to stay here.  Upon arrival a porter (Nepalese, very good Engish) welcomed me and helped unload my luggage, and accompany to the the check-in desk.  After check-in he also helped me take my luggage up to my room.  You can feel the step up in quality of the room equipment and furnishngs compared to other luxury hotels. The room and hotel were both historic yet modern.  There is a lounge bar with live jazz being played every night, on the ground floor as you enter from the front.  The only down side I would point out is the breakfast, it was not really to the standard I expected, when compared to lesser hotels I statyed at recently in China. The room rate was about CNY 900 / night, inclding breakfast.  If I could I would still gladly stay here again.",2
20674,"It had a friendly and relax feel. Staff always helpful. Room was small compared to big name hotels. As visitors to Singapore we didn't spend much time in our room. We didn't have a view from our window, but didn't need it with all of Singapore a short bus or train trip away.  Clean & comfortable bed to sleep, hot water shower and change of clothes. ",2
53311,"A lot of noise, during the day and night, the windows do not insulate and the air conditioning machines are very noisy ,several floors of rooms reform it . the cleaning standard is far from what is established in other countries. the personal is very kind and helpful",2

21842,"The hotel is not too far from Namyeongdong market where there’s a bargain hunt experience and plenty of places to eat.  There are many coffee shops around too! But most of all, the staff is very helpful and accommodating. We arrived before the actual check in time (9am) and they let us check in early! The room is quite small but the bed is very comfortable:) The hotel cafe is open for breakfast too.. food is great! Overall, I think this hotel is very reasonable.",2
47060,"I stayed here for an overnight on the way back home. I checked in late and was met by a friendly receptionist, who checked me in quick and gave me my key.  My room was only a very basic room, just a  sink, chair and small desk with shared bathroom facilities, ideal for an overnighter. The bed was nice and comfortable, just what i needed. The main thing being the room and hotel was very clean. I had room 5 on the first floor, a single basic, although it was directly over the bright red signage outside, once the curtains were drawn, the room was fine. The only worry i felt was, it can get quite noisy outside which you can hear in the room as its not double glazed. Check out early the next morning was fine and the staff were friendly and attentive at all times. They do not do breakfast, but there are lots of places in the immediate area. (Including their own cafe in the basement once it has been renovated) I would defiantly return, although I would probably pay for and have a room at the back with a bathroom included.   I would recommend this hotel without a doubt.",2
29282,"I relaxed at the hotel.clean and quiet. The hotel is very convenient because close to Asakusa station(walking around 5minutes )  If you stay there by yourself,I recommend it.  There's old Japanese spa (it called Goemonburo),this is so good.  I cared the sound of the other noise(for example,shower sound,doors sound),but If you don't care this,it's not problem.",2

Your capsule have internet and a TV. Bare in mind that the capsules are off courses very tiny. There are bathrooms in every floor but showers only in two floors. The staff was OK, not the usual excellent service you get in Japan. Bring earplugs... noise at night from other capsules might ruin your capsule experience.",2
42549,Stayed here for a couple of nights before flying down to Luxor to connect with our Nile cruise.  Food buffet style and they cook fresh omelets and pancakes if you so desire.  Food is varied as they cater for all nationalities.  ,2
15926,"This was a very expensive vacation. Valet parking for the week (for exchange members) was over $400. The location was good and bad. Good because you can walk to lots of restaurants and shopping. Bad because there was lots of homeless, trash, and constant sirens. The bed was very comfortable but we had 4 in our party and requested 2 king beds but was told only owners can have 2 beds others get a sleep sofa(not comfortable for a week). The air conditioning made a loud noise like gurgling in the walls. It kept us awake at times. The staff was very pleasant and we enjoyed the club level. This location might be great for a young couple but NOT a family. We would not return.",2
31281,"The hotel is in very strategic location for business stay right by Venceslav square. Easy to reach by car.  Rooms are old fashined, but comfortable and clean. I had the trouble with parking, but Lukas was very attentive and helped me park my car. Great breakfast is also a plus.",2
6348,"great location quick walk to the light rail, right at Darling Harbour so you can walk easily to the Aquarium, Chinese Gardens, Maritime Museum etc.  We had connecting rooms which was great for our family and Accor membership provided a good discount on the room rate.  We had rooms on the 8th floor with lovely views over Darling Harbour with the city lights.  Blackout curtains were very effective.  The self service buffet breakfast was extensive and there was plenty of seating and staff.  The restaurant wasn't open on Monday or Tuesday night for dinner which was disappointing but they had 24 hour room service which was quick when they eventually answered the phone.   Luckily we didn't want to use the pool or tennis court as the outside area was very neglected.",2
58588,"I've stayed at this lovely Hilton in Greenwich several times and it's my favourite in London. The staff are great - everyone, from the welcoming reception to the cleaning staff I've occasionally met in the corridor. The impressive entrance has twin chandeliers and marbal stairs.  And the bar area is fabulous, with it's Union Jack Ball Chair, comfortable sofas and spiral staircase. All the rooms I've stayed in have been top quality, from a simple single room to their lovely suites, with a 4-poster bed.  Many have intersting facts about the kings & queens printed on the glass bathroom doors. The food in the restaurant is excellent, and the buffet breakfast offers a great choice with more options that you can request from the chef. Always a truly enjoyable stay here.",2
10796,"We visit this hotel twice during our trip to Japan. Really nice hotel with good facilities near   Metro and JR station. This is very useful if you have JR pass. You can walk to SkyTree around 10-15 minand after it going to Asakusa Temple, where are you can find big souvenirs market.  Rooms is quit big with tea/coffee maker, 2 bottles of water wil be offered each day. Breakfast is perfect, it include western style dishes and asian corner. You can take a soft icecream if you want.",2
4538,"I stayed here for 2 nights and check in was quick and easy. The room had a king size bed and was  more like a studio apartment with a mini kitchen. The staff were friendly and the food and drink in the coffee shop was reasonably priced. Location good as we could shop, eat and drink locally and we also had a boat trip down the river. Taxis were readily available and price easy to negotiate.",2
11370,Very clean and tidy and staff were very pleasant and helpful. No room service information in my room and mini bar had been removed due to covid but just asked at reception and they told me what I needed to know - but could have had a throw away menu in room.,2
59575,"I’m about to say, georgeus environment along with fresh air, old-style chinese building in the middle of skycrapers and fish pond in it, just perfect! Sauna goes in, breakfast as well as michelin, attractive view between Gajah Mada and Harmoni.",2
46108,"This hotel has a great staff.  Everyone was eager to help us with whatever we needed from the moment we arrived.  The room, #615, was spotless and the bathroom was as well, complete with bidet and a spectacular shower.  I didn't need to use my travel hair dryer; theirs was more than adequate.  The hotel is approximately a 15-20 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. We took cabs to other places, such as Vatican City and the Colosseum. All the neighborhood restaurants served fabulous food and the house wines were delicious. The hotel has a nice rooftop bar with a great view of Rome at sunset. (We thought the drinks up there were complimentary.  We were wrong). The breakfast, however, was complimentary and it was fantastic.  Eggs, a variety of fruit, meat, bread, juice and cereal as well as a great cup of coffee every day. A few cons to consider:  the room had no drawers and if you like to unpack, know that you will be living out of your suitcase.  The hotel does not provide facial tissues (i.e., Kleenex) or hair conditioner  or washcloths.  The TV offers a rather dismal selection of English-speaking shows.  However, none of these cons are deal-breakers and I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly.",2
24667,"This place was highly recommended in almost all of the forums online. I am a bit skeptical about hostels, as I myself prefer a little luxury in some of my travels, but it has been a good experience for my hubby and I. You can get around the area (Fatih, Sultanahmet) quite conveniently. If you’re traveling alone and or open to discovering the city... the local way, then this is the place for you. The hostel/hotel offers a walking tour for free through the week and that for me was awesome. It is definitely the pitstop for first time travellers to Istanbul. Cheers!",2
38988,"The room although small was well designed.  Enough space to unpack.  Bed was very comfortable, air conditioning worked immediately,  and the shower,  although it did not have a strong pressure, worked well.  The room's have been updated and are well kept.  Elevator worked well.  Front desk was always helpful and provided a power adapter for my wife's hair straightener.  The hallways have not been updated which can be off putting when you arrive but don't fret.  Our room had no view but there was no street noise.  The walls were a bit thin and you could hear the shower running from next door but we never heard voices.  It was a 10-15 minute walk to the older section of town as well as to the newer restaurants in the quarter of Eixample.   We grabbed coffee from the numerous cafes surrounding the hotel.  There were many small grocery stores nearby as well.  Recommendation;  bring your own soap or body wash.  The size of the soap bar was hilariously small. ",2
6895,Back to here again 2 years later! Stayed private room this time. Even though the location is not very good but the 5 minutes walking distance isn't far. Breakfast is included and available every morning There is also a museum in the hostel compound.  There are many popular foods available near the hotel and popular shopping street too. Definitely will come back again!,2
17404,"The location of the hotel gave awesome break from busy city noise and still we were few steps from public transportation and took us 15 minutes walk to National theater witch we were visiting. All the hotel areas were spotless, rooms with plenty of space, great breakfast.  We really appreciated that most of historical parts of the building were kept. We will be back. Thank you!",2
62534,We had 2 bedrooms with shared bathroom. Everything was clean. There is coffe maker with big choice of capsules and a electric kettle in the room. I was afraid because of the pub downstairs but it´s not noisy. On photos the rooms look smallers than in  reality,2

Told us to come back at 1pm & when we did, they asked us to come back at 2pm. No recognition of Accor member or welcome drink like other hotels. Rooms a bit dated, could do with some upgrading. Good location but lots of roadworks directly out front. Not sure I would return. ",2
44981,So I am a frequent traveller and visited my friends in China. While looking for a place to have dinner I stumbled upon this restaurant which is just next to the malls and the lake.  The food is lets say exceptional. The service was nice. The presentation and the flavor. And I was just getting used to the Chinese cuisine. Great job guys. Will return back. ,2
4354,"I needed a hotel close to St.George’s Hospital. This hotel is the PERFECT location as access to the hospital grounds is an immediate left hand turn from the hotel entrance. I felt save when walking to and from the hotel in the evenings. The reception staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and stylish, excellent value for money, I was very impressed. The one down-side was breakfast. I had breakfast one morning, the rest of the time I bought fruit, yogurt and porridge pots to eat in my room. The continental style breakfast had limited choice and no coffee machine, only instant sachets, which was disappointing. Premier Inn charge a couple of pounds more for breakfast, with far more choice and a Costa coffee machine. I also found the woman who greeted guests for breakfast, rather abrupt. She was sitting at one of the tables doing paperwork when I arrived and did not smile when I walked in. This surprised me as the receptionists were so friendly as were the cleaners. I would recommend this hotel and stay again but would not waste my money on the breakfast.",2
41752,Large rooms with a Jacuzzi and an attached pool!! Good service. This resort has 3 restaurants where you can laze around. We generally hung around the Italian restaurant. Try their Salmon pizza and arak fusion cocktail.   The beach is really nice and very easily accessible.   Now for the not so nice bits! The kids were staying at the junior suites. Great views but they had to change rooms 3 times in 4 days because the air conditioning wasn’t working in the rooms!! On the last day our villa didn’t have any water in the toilet or in the bath. This was  a bummer.,2
38857,"When researching hotels on Santorini, it became apparent that a ""caldera view"" hotel (hotel on the side of the rim of an old volcano) was desirable in that it allowed the spectacular views to be appreciated most conveniently. As a result, ""caldera view"" were priced at a premium.  After having stayed in a caldera view hotel (Prekas) I can say that the convenient view is very nice and worth it if you can afford it, but that there are so many opportunities to enjoy the caldera view away from the hotel that you could still enjoy the full Santorini caldera experience without being in a caldera view hotel.  So dont feel like you are missing anything if you choose a less expensive option.  We booked almost a year out.  Prekas was on the lower price end of caldera view hotels, but it was still over $250 per night.  It seemed to strike a balance between the lowest cost possible and an authentic Greek looking caldera view hotel that met the minimum comfort standards.    We started a disadvantage because we were looking for a family room for 4, but Prekas did have a large room/suite that fit 4 very comfortably.  The room was large and had two private rooms within it, which was great.  It also had a kitchenette with a stove and refrigerator in it, which were nice to have.  Overall, the room was very spacious.  The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.  Chrissie, behind the front desk, was very helpful and nice.  The guy who helped with the luggage was also very helpful.  And you will definitely need his help.  The hotel rooms are spread up and down the side of a steep hill, and the only vehicle access is from a parking lot that is well above the hotel.  there is a ""long way"" to the hotel which involves a more gradually sloping walkway with some steps in it.  Getting luggage up this will still require some serious lifting and struggle.  There is also the ""short cut""  which involves going around a locked gate and down a long flight of steep stairs (some with big gaps in them) with  a little bare mountain path thrown in (all unlit at night).  If you have problems with stairs, this is not for you.  Dont even think about carrying your luggage on the short cut.  Some of the rooms require using even more steep staircases.  There is a guy who will transport all of your luggage at the hotel though, so all you have to do is walk.   The hotel itself is in the beautiful, whitewashed Greek style and blends in with the adjoining buildings and is very picturesque.  The views are spectacular and equal to any on the island, with a clear view of the sunset.  The Imerovigli location is fine and seemed better to me than the Fira location because it was much more quiet and peaceful, but other people may prefer the convenience and activity of Fira. There were plenty of dining options available in the area (Prekas does not have a restaurant), although generally they were not as convenient as what Fira can offer.  The closest options would be near the parking lot (where a convenience store is also located), and more options are available in the nearby town (where there are also bigger supermarkets), which is in fairly easy walking distance, although it is an uphill walk going there.    The hotel has a small pool.  One thing that was not clear from the website concerns the views.  Our room was directly above the reception area.  It is in the website photos, and shows two separate bedrooms withing the main room, although I cant remember the number.  In our area, there were about three rooms clustered around one caldera/sunset viewing area, which made things a little awkward.  There was no clear delineation as to which room had which viewing area, so there was the potential for conflicts between rooms over the best viewing area.  We never had any conflicts and were able to use the best area, but it was definitely not in complete privacy from our neighbors.  I understand that some rooms may have private viewing areas.  On the negative side, the room was uncomfortably damp and humid inside it (apparently due to the cave-like construction), although it did have an air conditioner and a couple of humidity reduction devices in the room.  This was not unbearable and the room did not seem moldy, but if you are sensitive to this, you should know.  No one in our party complained about it.  Another negative was the bathroom.  It was tiny and the shower did not have any shower curtain and was extremely small and cramped.  By the time you showered the whole room was wet.  Toilet paper could not be flushed in the toilet, as is apparently true in most of Greece.  Overall, I would give the room and hotel a good/better than average rating, largely based on the big space and the great view, although you should remember that for Santorini, this may be considered to be more of a budget hotel.  It is a true caldera view hotel, and if that is your top priority, then this will fit the bill at one of the better prices, although it may not have all of the comforts that you would expect for an equally priced hotel that was not on the caldera.  I would return.",2

58234,"We (myself, husband and son - 2), stayed at the San Remo Hotel late April/ early May 2019.  We had a room with a double bed and a single bed.  No sink.  Some notes:  1. The hotel is really neat - it seems original (1906), claw foot tubs, ornate sinks, interesting art everywhere.  Keep in mind you do need to walk up to the second level to get to the reception desk, and that rooms are located on three levels.   2.  The shared washrooms/showers are kept very clean, they empty the garbage regularly, they smell clean (air freshener), and they have a variety of amenities for guests (qtips, cotton pads, combs, mouthwash).  The showers have a nice shampoo/conditioner.  I did have to search around for an open toilet one morning, when the hotel was particularly busy.   3.  There's massage chairs on each floor! 4.  They have a table at the front with snacks/coffee/hot water.   5.  No air conditioning, but they have fans/heaters in the room.  It was quite nice while we were there, so we kept the windows open and had the fan going until it was too cool.   6.  Beds are older, but comfy.   7.  Rooms are small - at least it felt small, which all three of us, but with the age of the hotel you have to expect this.  8.  We had a room on an outside wall - I think this would be ideal, but the interior rooms also have windows onto the hallway for light.   9.  Location is good - adjacent to public transportation, the waterfront, and a nice public playground if you have a child with you into that sort of thing.  There's some restaurants near by, including an Italian place right in the building and a mexican place the block down - oh and there's a Trader Joe's really close too.    We would stay here again, mostly because of the quality of the hotel experience, even though it had shared bathrooms/showers, price and the location.",2
9992,"This Marriott is in a nice location downtown. However there is no parking and the fees are exorbitant so best not to bring a car.  Also, the new Bonvoy doesn’t allow concierge room access for Amex platinum cc holders.  We will no longer make Marriott our preferred hotel since we can get better benefits in other hotels with the Amex.  Without the concierge room availability there’s no difference to staying elsewhere. SFO is full of nice hotels so pick a different one.",2

60444,"What a hidden little gem, the location is unbeatable and the view from the window was breathtaking. We had the superior room with the window overlooking the Piazza and it was amazing, every day we sat at our window watching the people and the buskers. All major attractions are so close and within walking distance. The back streets were great and provided plenty of choice for lunch or dinner. Breakfast was delivered to our room each morning at the time you choose, starting from 7:30am and the selection is more than ample, although croissants were a little uneatable due to their burnt crisp state. It was an added bonus to have a fridge in the room with juices and soft drinks free of charge. The room was modern, generously spacious, spotlessly clean and the beds were super comfy. Once the shutters were closed we heard no noise from the outside or the room next door. We only ever saw the staff at check in, check out and when our breakfast was delivered, so just be aware no one is physically there to assist during the day/night. We would definitely stay here again - an unforgettable stay. TIP: get the private transfer from the airport, they will deliver you direct to the front door which would be hard to find without them pointing it out.  Make sure you confirm your arrival time with staff. We waited at the entrance door buzzing for a good 15 mins till someone came along and were told the buzzer goes to another apartment.",2
2241,"We had some difficulty getting to it as we were held up at Rome Airport, but as we drove up Via Labicana there was Aldo waiting to greet us and help with the luggage, having waited for an hour. We found the room everything we could have wished, spacious enough for a couch, a desk and a large double bed. Continental breakfast was brought in on a dumb waiter each morning and set us up for a great days of walking around Rome. everything was clean and well laid out - I recommend it for anyone. As the entrance is on a main road that is well lit it is quite secure as the outer and inner doors are both locked and you have both keys. There is a great ice cream/coffee/cake shop about 150 metres down the road towards the Colosseum.",2

46214,"The Hotel is in good location with easy access to Metro and Trains, few minutes metro ride to hart of Paris tourist area. Has its own parking which is a major plus if you arrive by car. Hotel reception staff are friendly and helpful rooms are modern and good size. So why I am not giving 5 star, it has to do with AC in our room which quite working in middle of the night, next morning at 9 AM I informed front desk as we were going out for few hours, when we returned at 2PM it was still not fixed and the room was hot, informed front desk again and we went out, returning at 3.30 PM and still not fixed , informed front desk again and from that point on visited Front desk every 15 minute to check as room was very hot and each time being told maintenance is on there way , finally they did come at 4.30 and told me they have just been notified 20 minutes earlier. It took them 10 minutes to fix snd all was fine thereafter till I checked the bed snd found the sheets which were very visibly solid due to an accident was not changed, another call to front desk snd this one was corrected after we returned from dinner.  Hence a perfect stay was ruined do to inaction   Fixing a problem that required 10 minutes of work but it took 24 to get it accomplished.  I must not I am a loyal Marriott customer and this is my first negative experience in many year with the Brand.",2
60868,Good value for money. There’s nothing fancy about the hotel but it was cheap. The owners are really nice and the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood. We were prepared for being a bit further out as we read reviews and I can confirm you do need a few Ubers to get around. The room was a little smaller than expected would be my only negative comment. As we had 2 large suitcases there was nowhere to put them and move. If you had 2 small cases for a short break this would have been less of an issue. Also no lift.,2
33497,Excellent room with a view despite the fact that I was travelling solo.  The only problem is this particular room bathroom had peeling caulking around the bathtub ([photo attached)  and the bed skirt was being held in one spot by a safety pin,2
32004,This hostel is really Nice hostel to stay for long term or short term also the staff are friendly and very helpfull. The Swimming pool area is very relaxing to chill during the day and also night time the bar arrange a lot of different game. I highly recommend this place to stay for the couple or single. Cheers,2

From Bus stop, cross the road, turn right then turn left, hotel just straight ahead. We have requested a renovated room, the room was fantastic new, clean and big room, living room with sofa and 2 toilet. So far this is the biggest and most comfortable room I stayed in Seoul.

19420,"Arrived at hotel from Patong to enjoy a peaceful and lazy few days by the beach  Arrived in afternoon and was allocated a upgrade to 3rd floor pool view . Room was a large room overlooking the pool very nice but a little tired and dated , only thing annoying was glass panels overlooking pool had large cracks in them !! . Tried evening buffet in restaurant that night thought was ok but a bit pricey for what you got 995 bht pp. the nxt day we went out of room for 6 hrs to come back to find room not cleaned asked at reception to sort and they said it would be done straight away  2 hrs later still not sorted so went to see hotel reception manager moie who was very sorry and moved us to a exceptional room complete with own swimming pool a duplex apartment spread over 2 floors thank you to hotel reception manager . Next day we where greeted by Dennis who is hotel general manager who could not apologise enough but glad we had now been sorted and offered us a complimentary massage as a good will gesture  Overall the hotel is excellent but a little tired in places , staff are tremendous and always smiling , they run a shuttle bus into Patong town twice a day the pools and views from the pool and beach are to die for  Overall a good hotel which I would visit again due to the care of the general manager Dennis in seeing a slight problem and sorting straight away  If you want to visit phi phi vist local tour operator at side of hotel who will do a excellent day trip to there and monkey island with star boats for 2500bht each",2
26631,"Sousse Palace Hotel enjoys a good position in Sousse, right on the sea and very close to the medina and also to the train station. It is made of several buildings, with the main ""tower"" in front and several smaller buildings towards the sea. There is a nice outdoor pool (for which it was too cold) and an indoor one. The appearance is quite luxurious, with large common areas, classy cafes and shisha areas. The staff is very professional and even too polite, and there is a visible presence of security, a somber but unavoidable reminder of the recent terrorist attacks in the area. Overall I had a good experience there: the rooms are large and in most cases with sea views and balcony, there are two restaurants (more in summer) and a pretty, even though rather expensive, top floor bar with city view, the breakfast is truly spectacular and the price is overall relatively low. However, some things can be improved. The hotel, for example, is very much ""smokers friendly"", which I find extremely annoying. Apart maybe from the breakfast room, smoking is basically allowed everywhere. Moreover, the room I was given at the start heavily stank of smoke, as if a chain smoker stayed there for a week without ever opening the windows. It was truly unbearable. However the staff dealt efficiently and graciously with my complaint and I was quickly given a room of the same size but mercifully without any recent smoking activity inside. Also, the room service was somehow debatable, with some hair and dust clearly visible on the bathroom floor that was not removed in three days. The pool area leads directly to the beach, that this time of the year looked empty and terribly dirty. I hope it's better in summer. Overall anyway I would recommend the hotel and Sousse in general, which has a pretty medina and ribat. The staff tries its best and it is a bit of a miracle that a big hotel like this has survived the tourist crisis felt in the area in the last years, sadly reminded by the many empty and abandoned hotels along the sea.",2
46405,Ticked all boxes. Good location. Small but hygienic room. Good location. 2 kms from beach. Service was very good. Really friendly staff. We spent 4 nights here. Good option for value minded customers. We had breakfast as an option and spread though same each day had good quality stuff. Only area of improvement was kettle was not provided in the room. No proper cupboard and locker available. ,2

We walked in the pouring rain from RER Musee D'Orsay with our luggage and were never so glad to find our welcoming little room. After drying off we went down to the bar/lounge area to try our first Ricard.  The gentleman in the reception area never failed to give us good service in the bar, providing welcome snacks and drinks and warmth from the rain. Yes, building is older and rooms are small but everything needed was provided.  If you are looking for luxury and extras then this would not be for you.  Oh, and the hairdryer and elevator worked great.",2

64042,The hotel is very nice and is located about 20 min walk from Monastiraki Flea Market.  They have a number of restaurants near the hotel that are very nice.  Breakfast is a bit repetitive and could use a bit more variety.   The room is comfortable but seems a bit dated. Show is hoes hot and cold so that needs work.  Biggest issue is the Wi-Fi which is not good.   They have a business centre at the hotel.  The Staff are very friendly.  They have a pool bar at the top with views of the Acropolis.  Nice at night.   Hotel is very busy as the cruise ship passengers and land tours start from this hotel.  Overall nice hotel.,2

She even helped my get my large American luggage up to the second floor.  That's above and beyond and gave a great first impression!  The hotel was clean, hot water and shower pressure all good, and restaurants close by. Took Uber there from the airport and the next day to the train station.  You can easily walk to Paddington, but we had luggage so that was not our first choice. Highly recommend (if you don't mind stairs without an elevator).",2
35689,"Our family of 4 stayed in Barcelona for 2 nights after exiting a cruise.  We were promised a secure luggage location since we were arriving so early.  Upon arrival, Eric was there to greet us and secure our luggage with a large locker for each family.  Quick check-in that included a briefing on everything we needed to know about the hotel which also included a map with descriptions on places to see and eat.  The room was very spacious with everything working and a kitchen area that was ready for long term stays if cooking meals etc...  Plenty of hot water and since it was very hot (Heat Wave) the AC system took a while to cool down the room.  The only suggestion I have for the rooms is to leave the AC running so the first few hours in the room have a better welcoming experience.  We stayed on the 6th floor in room #63.  There was some noise pass into the room so if you had loud neighbors that could be a problem but only 2 or 3 rooms per floor so our stay was very quiet.  Nice place to stay and we were all very happy with things all the way around.  Thanks Eric for taking the time to explain your lovely city and Boutique Apartments.  Will stay with you again!!",2

The first time was when it had a major renovation and the hotel looked fantastic and we had welcome drinks whilst waiting to check in. In my opinion, although it is still a lovely place to stay with large rooms, it needs updating. The house keeping do a great job and i would like to thank Keny Liu for looking after us throughout our stay, always happy, friendly and polite. The doorman who has been there for many years is always polite and friendly helped us with our suitcases to the bus stop. We always prefer to stay in rooms on higher floors. We will be hopefully booking to stay again later this year.",2

The location is excellent close to MRT, buses, shops and restaurants.  The housekeeping manager, Mui Leng, was very professional and helpful with excellent customer service skills. All of her staff were very well trained, efficient and helpful.  Mui Leng was able to rectify most of the issues we had during our stay and those issues she could not help with should be included in the future renovations which should occur early next year.   Mui Leng was also very helpful in providing a wealth of information regarding local eateries, food courts, shopping locations and advice on how to use the MRT and buses to easily and inexpensively get around Singapore.

15577,"I spent four nights at the Emirkhan Hotel.  The hotel is small, cozy, rather homely, the staff is very friendly. There is a Russian-speaking receptionist.  The room is small, but lovely, equipped with all hotel amenities.  Typical breakfast - omelette, sausages, sausage, cheese, coffee, vegetables, honey, butter, bread, etc. You won't stay hungry.  The hotel is located in the Fatih district, very close to the Marmara Sea embankment. Just literally 10 minutes on foot through the winding streets and you are on Sultanahmet Square. And there are many attractions right next door. And the tram also passes there, it is called the metro in Istanbul. You can buy a card for him directly at the hotel. By tram you can also get to the Aksaray stop of the Havaist12 bus to the new airport.  The Fatih district is very colorful, there are continuous photogenic views around. There are many hotels, cafes, restaurants, shops with sweets and souvenirs, mosques, temples, picturesque ruins. All the staff at the hotel are very nice, sincerely trying to help.  I was satisfied, the price is quite in line with my expectations, the impressions are the best.",2

35710,"I stayed here for two nights with much pleasure. The apartment is very well furnished with a keen and comfortable lay out. Kitchen is well equipped, very complete. The only negative is the water pressure. It seems a small thing but can be rather dangerous. Very hot water is with high pressure available because of the boiler in the apartment. However, cold water pressure is poorly and the tab in the shower is not working properly. Taking a shower with a comfortabel water temperature is quite a challenge and you end up with a poor trickle of water. Such a shame for this lovely apartment.",2

You might even be lucky enough to meet the owner (a garden enthusiast) doing some gardening!  The cottages all have their own verandah and nothing is nicer than sitting in the morning sun and eating your room service breakfast (included in the room charge)and listening to the bird song (a plus of the garden setting).  The cottages are roomy and spotless, with garden  bathrooms and sunken marble bath;  the smiling staff cannot do enough to make your stay a good one; and Poppies restaurant is a short walk away.

6985,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my family visiting Sydney for the first time. The rooms were very spacious, clean, and staff were all very nice. The Wi-Fi also worked very well. Location was amazing as the hotel was a few minute walk from Central Station allowing for train connectivity all over the city. It was also in the heart of Chinatown, offering a wide variety of Asian restaurants and stores to browse while also being  within a close walk to Darling Square/Harbour. It is on the further side of a walk from popular touristy places such as Sydney Opera House and Circular Quay, but you can take the tram that stops near the hotel that will take you there in around 10 minutes. One thing to note is that housekeeping did not clean our rooms unless we specifically requested it by putting the sign on the door handle so keep that in mind. Overall, a great stay at the Novotel and would stay here again if in Sydney.",2

30972,"I wanted to like this place but a lot of things need attention:   Checking In… just horrendous. Only 2 Staff Members checking in guests at 4PM when there is a huge line! Terrible first impression and bad vibes about this place from the start.  My wife waited in the car with our kids and her first message “this place is ghetto” which unfortunately there were a lot of trashy guests staying here so yeah… ghetto  Tip: Only head of household needs to be present at the check in counter.  Everyone else stay in your car. It was SO loud from children and babies I couldn’t even hear what they were telling me from across the desk.    $200 hold on a credit/debit card which wasn’t expected, $24/day for parking which I expected but to me is ridiculous.  You can charge food and drinks to your room but it doesn’t come out of the $200 hold they will charge your card on file around checkout time.    The room was clean and would have been fine however there is a door to an adjoining room which makes it very easy to hear your neighbor. Lucky us had the loudest most ghetto people that were constantly yelling and slamming doors.   We were on the main level of building 10 which I was happy about because I read quite a few reviews about elevators not working. There was an ice machine near the elevator which was great.  Housekeeping only comes on request and seemed to do the bare minimum of towels and taking the trash. They don’t even put the trash bag liner on the can they just leave it for you to do. Uhh… enough said.   I called and requested bedding for the pullout bed and extra pillows and was told they didn’t have any pillows??? is this not a hotel how do you not have pillows… wow.   Coffee people listen up… a YouTube review I watched said their room had a Keurig.  We were not so lucky. Our room just had one of those tiny coffee makers.  Your options at the marketplace pay $7 per cup at the Hershey Ice Cream stand. I did this the first day. The ladies that work there are very sweet.  Your other option is the breakfast buffet.  The coffee at the buffet is decent but the mugs are tiny so we were drinking 2 at a time.  Sadly those were the only coffee options and since we were on a budget we couldn’t do the buffet everyday. Please put Keurig “K-cup” brewers in all the rooms, that would have made our mornings so much easier.  Tip: Breakfast buffet is about $10 cheaper if you pay at the front desk vs. paying at the restaurant.  Kids under 11 were free which was nice but it was about $43 or $53 if I remember correct for 2 adults depending where you paid. This is definitely a great value if you have kids like mine that are always hungry. Good job here IHG.   The pools and “waterpark” well.. the entire week only 1 (green) of the 3 big water slides was open.  This was very frustrating because I chose this resort for the Waterpark. Guests pay a daily resort fee for things like this so why only 1 slide??? My kids quickly got bored and the line was long since there was only 1 slide in operation.  Also, half the time nobody is standing at the top monitoring the kids.  I went up there and it was a total free for all. Random kids were assuming the role of “lifeguard” and telling kids when to go.  Is this safe? What a joke  The pool area games are a joke. The pool sticks are completely trashed and unusable.  We couldn’t play mini golf because “mischievous kids” stole all the golf balls.   The water temperature in the lagoon pool is way too cold.  The “Oasis” pool is slightly warmer but still not great.  Because of the cold pools the kids completely take over the hot tubs even though there are signs saying “Adult Spa” and “age 13 and older only” but not once were these rules enforced.  So have fun trying to relax in a hot tub full of little kids! Nope! Terrible.   Not once did I see an employee enforcing the rules.  Wristbands? No clue… we were given them at check-in but half the people there didn’t have a wristband and again, not enforced at all.  What a mess.  Some lovely ladies even tried to steal our lounge chairs despite the fact our clothes and other items were on them.  Who does that?   The pool bar at the lagoon has good drinks but $16 for a bucket and then no discount on a refill.  Normal drinks are $10.  The bar and restrooms at the Oasis pool were closed the entire week.  Annoying.   Overall, the place could be decent but I would not return.  Too many problems and disappointments.  It’s a shame because I’ve had great luck with IHG up until this.  I hope they can turn this place around.",2
41424,"I have enjoyed the warm and genuine hospitality of Puri Bagus three times in the last four years. For each of my stays, with my family and twice with a large group of 30, the resort exceeded our expectations.  The staff is professional and well informed on the local tourist options. Within the lovely resort grounds, Krisna, the General Manager and Ayarthi, the Quality Manager, lead a friendly staff that anticipate your needs and seamlessly accommodate your requests. In the beautiful restaurant, Sudiastari, oversees an delicious selection of Indonesian and Western foods. She and all of the restaurant staff are almost as fantastic as the view. I felt privileged to be their guest. My pre and young teen kids were treated respectfully and had an incredible experience exploring the grounds and hanging out at the pool. The cooking classes were excellent and really fun. (I’m a professional chef) Though I didn’t experience the yoga or spa, friends positively commented on their experience.   As the sign in the room reminds your “Bali is not heaven...”. I wish the beach in front of the hotel were restored to its former state, and efforts are underway to restore the protective reef. When everyone hits the restaurant at the same time, there might be a wait. The facilities are not brand new but are very clean and well maintained. Great beaches, and diving, and hiking, and restaurants are close by.  I have plans to return in both summer ‘19 and ‘20. You should too, but not at the same time!",2

61819,"Really friendly staff. Very appreciative of very early check-in. Really good location. Room was spacious and clean with good comfy bed - also enjoyed having a bathtub. Hotel is in need of a facelift - a lot of cosmetic changes required to actual hotel and rooms, in order to bring it into 2023. Based on this, it was a little expensive for what it was",2
65190,"Stayed for two nights, good thing we were able to check in early after all the standing time we had at CGD airport (Custom its a chaos); First room the AC was not working but the Front Desk Agent changed us to a bigger room with working AC and Fan. Breakfast was good, it's served on the lower level and it feels a little bit hot down there,  Coffee was available all day through a machine, they also have a Social Hour from 6-8 with drinks and snacks.  This hotel is close to the Rome station, after you come up on the street you have to walk back (South) and turn right on the first street and keep right all the way to the hotel, there is a grocery store at the corner and there are lots of restaurants around the area, we feel safe walking late at night; Please be aware that restaurants open at 7:00 pm for dinner, not before. Train system its easy and convenience to handle.  The hotel has Wifi available and we also like the fact that they offer a router to carry on all day for just 1 euro daily, They might ask you for a deposit up front. All staff members were helpful, kind and speak English.",2
45066,"lakeside is an incredible bustle, especially in the evening , but this was extremely tranquil inside. the remodelled floor had a very high level of finish and rooms were pretty spacious. Restaurant was fine and service generally good. only drawback was layout of the big room in the middle of the forecourt meant that there was no real view of the lake.",2
44102,"probably a great conference hotel but we booked for a honeymoon, and it wasnt really ideal for a honeymoon, even though it markets itself that way. Nice venue, and it was nice to be out of the rat race, but the hotel was too business like in all its functions and not overly warming etc.   Its also very large, larger than i expected, which is our fault when researching, but some places handle size well, and disguise it, this property doesnt, and its size is a cumbersome hindrance.   The dining options, apart from Breakfast which was massive, were a let down. ",2
2740,Pros:  I liked the location! Very central. Quite a few restaurants near by. Not too far from the Estacio Del Nord. The crowd and vibe was pretty good. The club was better than I expected especially the DJ. Don't know if he's regular or name but he's performing on 29/07/2022. The service was excellent as well. Cons: Towels were separate and had to be bought. I've lived in other hostels where towels were part of the deal. Room felt a bit congested for 3 pairs of bunk beds. ,2
26568,"I first came across this hotel through tripadvisor's website. The hotel is extremely comfortable budget hotel, with a swimming pool to itself.  I had booked this hotel before reaching Phuket. I was very satisfied with the overall customer service they provided.  We had hired a Taxi from the airport to the hotel directly. First we were a little skeptical about the rates, but when we figured out about the market rates we found their rate to be very reasonable.  The hotel is located near to the Kata beach, which is around 15 minutes of walk. The beach in itself is located in a calm environment and so is the hotel, away from the hustle bustle of the city.  At the end I would rate this hotel as very good among the others we had stayed in during our trip to Thailand.",2
27825,"We found this hotel ideal as it was located within 5 minutes of the Metro, and it was easy to travel wherever we wanted to get to consequently.  Its not far from Ueno Park by metro where there is masses to see and do, museums, the lake, the pagoda etc.  The hotel has a very nice ambiance, calm, with a big foyer, with comfortable sofas.  We couldn't get into our room unfortunately until official check-in time (they would have let us if there had been a room ready) so we left our luggage with them and sallied forth to do some sightseeing.  The staff were very friendly, spoke English.  Good european and japan breakfast buffet.  A good choice of hotel in the heart of the city.  we had a superior twin room.  It wasn't that spacious so glad we had the upgrade.",2
2311,"We found this courtesy of Trip Adviser, and were overwhelmed by our experience.  Yes it is the Training Hotel, but look beyond the trainees who are learning (with you as guinea pigs) and just enjoy being treated like royalty...even if it may take a couple of goes for them to get it perfect.  Rooms were stunning and very spacious indeed with awesome views over the South China Seas.  All the facilities you might need or want, and the mobile phone for your stay was really helpful.  Fascinated by the glass wall that turns opaque at the push of a button.  You are aware that staff is comprised of students at various levels of training, but the level of supervision they receive means that their inexperience does not detract from the quality of service on offer.  We had a group of about 8 students to show us to our room, with one who was put on the spot to explain how everything worked. We ate twice in the evening (in addition to the included breakfast) and were impressed by the quality, and price. Provided you can cope with the amount of attention you will receive we don’t think you can go far wrong with the T hotel, which we felt was a real find. VERY easy to access direct from the airport with a No 10 bus, which stops less than 100 metres from the door. ... don’t try going via Central! Easy access to Stanley, Aberdeen, and Hong Kong centre by lots of frequent buses.  The students’ supervisors were also exceptionally helpful in getting us information about places to visit, transport etc.  HIGHLY recommended, though you are likely to need to book direct, as we couldn’t find an agency who handled their reservations.

21281,"We just spent a week here.  Hotel and surrounding pool area are very clean. Our room had a small balcony, but good size twin beds, there is a fridge and kettle provided as well as Air con and safe (free of charge). Our bathroom had the usual flappy curtain, but the lip to the shower just about caught the water so it didn't flood the floor too much, always plenty of hot water with good pressure.  The room was cleaned every day. Breakfast was very tasty and lots of choice but the buffet area is quite small and you can get in one anothers way.  Pool area had comfy sunloungers and the pool itself was lovely and clean but a bit cold.  There was a small amount of towel reserving the beds but we used the beach too which belongs to the Hotel.  A pool towel is provided but you need to use your own for the beach. As been reported it is black sand so Hot, sea clean but freezing ! Plenty of good choice or Tavernas nearby and bars that sell large beer for 2 Euro, Hotel it was 4 Euro.",2
60328,"We picked this hotel for a 15-night stay based on some good reviews on Tripadvisor and price.  Price: definitely not the type of big chain hotels like Marriott, Lotte, Hilton or Sofitel. It is also much less expensive. I also got a better rate booking directly with the hotel, as I compared prices offered by Expedia or Booking.com or Agoda or Hotel.com. No problem at all communicating with the hotel directly through email.  Location: across the hotel is a Bethany's Square which is a huge complex of Presbyterian Church, Pastor's residence, education hall and memorial hall. Hence the hotel is fairly quiet, even though there are many small restaurants in the same block. Supyo-ro is a main street but traffic is usually sparse.   Neighbourhood: many many coffee shops and restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood. The variety is a bit limited because the majority of restaurants serve bbq meat or octopus or hotpots. Metro stations are about 10 mins walk so it is easy to get to the subway.   Facilities: the roof-top garden is a great feature as it offers panoramic view of the city. The laundry room in the basement has two washers and two dryers. The wash cycle takes 1.5 hours so be careful not to go sightseeing after starting tge laundry. The small gym is adequate.  There is no restaurant onsite. The restaurant and buffet photos at the hotel website are not up-to-date.   Room: we had a King room with two beds. A small fridge and safe. Enough space for two. Storage space is limited as there us only one closet. The hotel can easily add some wall shelves. We had to leave our stuff in the luggages. Shower was good as well as the ""high-teach"" toilet.  Cliental: mostly single or couples. Had not seen large families and children.  The hotel was very quiet. Perhaps April was not busy tourist season. We were usually alone in one of the two elevators.   ",2
45036,"The Grand Hyatt Hangzhou is on its way to becoming a great place to visit. It already has an attentive, helpful, capable staff; world-class food; and proximity to and a view of beautiful Xihu and the mountains that frame its background. 28 Hubin Road is as fine a restaurant as one could ever want; and the evening buffet at Grand Cafe featured ample variety, excellent quality and remarkably fresh items. We ate just after 19:00, and it was as if each dish had been prepared specially for our table. In my experience, it was second only to Singapore (Marina Bay) Ritz Carlton buffet. The one drawback with the hotel right now--and it's temporary--is that it's in the middle of both its own and city construction projects that make navigating to and from the hotel challenging. If you don't mind extra walking--and occasional back-tracking as needed--or if you're willing to wait until construction is finished, you won't be disappointed by a visit there.",2
49615,"The hotel is located near DDP so its basically a shopping area. The transport network is great as you could simply go to Novotel and wait for the airport limousine or walk 500m(?) to get to the metro.

State of the art gym too! Great stay!",2

Especially, Daniel, who gave us some really great tips for getting around and what to see, and Louisa, who told us of some really good, local restaurants (we especially liked I. Bhutterri and Bruto's and LOVED Emilio's!). The hotel is small and located in a very quiet neighborhood, which was great to come back to after being in the crowded touristy areas all day.",2

We were able to catch the train from the airport and get off at MUSEUM, and then a very short walk to the hotel.  The room was very spacious and the kids absolutely loved choosing which packet of cereal they were going to eat in the morning! The microwave, fridge, kettle and fridge were also very handy.  I would definitely stay here again as it is centrally located to everything!  ",2

15986,"We have been members of Palace for 12 years and love the food, facilities and service.  This trip we had a party of 12 adults.  While the food/service and facilities are still top notch, this was the worst trip we've been on because of the ""business of vacation"". It has convinced us not to recommend Palace to any friends and also to not consider upgrading as a result.  Here are some of the issues we faced: Spa Credits:  When we last upgraded, part of the upgrade was Spa Credits.  In the contract we specified that the Spa Credits could be used by 5 people - the parents and our 3 adult children.  We bought a week in a Presidential Suite, the parents in one room, the adult children in the other.  When we went to make Spa reservations, we were told the children could not use the spa credits, even though 1. They are beneficiaries and 2. The contract specifies a party of five.  Bringing this up to the vacation planners had them pointing to member services, who in turn sent us to PR. At the presentation the next day, we brought this up with our sales reps, since they had sold us the Spa Credit package, and they agreed any of the beneficiaries should be able to use the credits per the contract and they would put a note to that effect on our reservation.  When we went to make spa reservations the Vacation Planners repeated we couldn't do that and then sent us back to member services, who once again sent us to PR, but this time told us to ask for the Supervisor.  The Supervisor was busy and left with a different customer.  Finally a different PR person came a spoke the the ""higher ups"" who finally allowed us to use our Spa credits on our children who were sharing a suite with us. It took us 6 hours of precious vacation time to utilize something we had paid for and gives us no incentive to ""upgrade"" when we have to fight for everything we believe we've paid for.  Universal Credits; We agreed for 2 families to attend the presentation in exchange for Universal credits earned by each family to be used against a sunset cruise for both families to take.  Since the cruise was going to be our treat, we asked the member services rep to apply both parties credits to be applied to our room against the cruise.  They assured us this would be done.  At the sales office after the presentation, we once again asked about getting all the credits assigned to our room (the other family was with us and agreed) and they assured us this was done.  It wasn't. More time was spent on this at checkout and it was never resolved.  We ended up having the other family venmo us the money.  Different Prices between online flyer and in-person: The online price for the Sunset cruise was $89.  When we went to make the reservation at the hotel, we were told it was $129.  When I dug up the webpage to confirm it was $89, the Vacation Planner had to look it up himself, then get clearance to honor the price.  He did, but this again is more time wasted on the ""business of vacation"" and made me lose trust in the organization.  Vacation Planner change: On the subject of vacation planners, it is clear to me that they now work on commission.  Why do I think that?  because every time I walked through the lobby I was asked by at least one whether I wanted to book an excursion.  While they did so respectfully and didn't push it was an intrusion and brought business back into vacation.  Restaurant Reservations/accommodations: We recognize that a large party of 12 is hard to make reservations for.  We put our names in at Jade (in the Grand) and were told the wait would be 45 minutes.  OK.  It was more like an hour, but that was not the problem.  When we were seated the entire restaurant was near empty - there were many tables that were set and could easily have accommodated us.  Similarly, we made reservations at Trattoria and Agra.  The earliest we were given was 9 for Trattoria and 9:45 at Agra.  Both times when we arrived the restaurants were nearly empty.  In fact at Agra there was only one other table seated when we arrived, and they wouldn't even move the tables together.  They also pointed out the kitchen closed at 10:30, and the staff needed to leave at 11 to get the last bus.  There was no reason we could see for the late reservations or at the very least calling us when tables opened up.  The one issue we had with the facility is that our suite's AC didn't work properly - the rooms couldn't get colder than 72 and were so humid the sheets felt damp.  We called 2x and we were told someone would take a look at it, but there was no change.  So in summary, the food is great, the staff is great, the facilities are very good, but the ""business of vacation"" is really killing the experience and leads us to resist any upgrade/referrals.  Everyone seems to point you in a different direction to get you out of their face and no one steps up to take ownership of anything.  If I were only rating the food/service/facility it would be 5 stars, but accounting for the experience of getting what we paid for, it's 2 - that's how frustrating it is.",2

There was a little bit of confusion about the minimal spend but it was quickly resolved so as 2 ladies on a Monday we didn't have a minimum spend.

I would 100% recommend the pool, the pool bar and Raman too.",2

63727,"Stayed two nights. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Club room breakfast was good and a calm atmosphere. Evening canapés very underwhelming. Was disappointed with variety and quantity. Hotel bar needs to be better stocked with wine variety. Room was large and clean, bed comfortable. Air conditioning was set around 23 degrees and could not be turned down so it got a little warm during the night. ",2
23698,"We stayed at this fantastic little hotel situated, roughly 5 minute walk from Avenue des Champs-Elysees, for 3 nights, across September weekend. On arrival, the staff were prompt and informative and quickly got us to our room after a long day of travelling. We were told breakfast was available each morning and brought to our room for just €8, which we thought was very reasonable. We didn’t try the food, so cannot comment on the quality. The hotel has recently been redecorated and was simply stunning. Very modern and a pleasant surprise - very different from the photos we had seen upon booking. Spotlessly clean, maid serviced our room with fresh towels etc every day and she was lovely and polite. Bed was very comfortable and spacious. The balcony and city view was nothing short of perfect. Location was perfect. Local supermarket “Franprix” is less than 5 minutes walk away. Avenue des Champs-Elysees - 5 minutes walk. Arc de Triomphe - 10 minutes walk. Eiffel Tower - roughly 30 minutes walk, however, the metro station “Miromesnil” is roughly 2-3 minutes away and well connected throughout the city. We got the metro to the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and Notre Dame and nothing was more than 4 stops away. Can, also, get this metro station to Charles De Gualle Airport. This journey only costs €10 per person and takes about 1hr 45. Great hotel and we will certainly be back. The room is advertised as soundproof and, certainly, the doors to the balcony are soundproof and very effectively block out the noise from the street. However, the doors and walls inside the building are not and because the hotel was under construction whilst we were there, there was a bit of noise in the mornings from workmen in the hallways. Nothing significant but worth noting. The room also can get a tad warm but the room comes with a fan so, obviously, something they’re aware of. The plug sockets are also child protected which meant our adapters didn’t fit but can buy an adapter which does work from the local supermarket for about €7. TV is advertised as a feature, however, be aware all channels are in French, with no English options. This wasn’t an issue for us as we were out exploring mostly, but, again, worth mentioning. Seen a few people making negative comments about the elevator. Having stayed in Paris three times now, it was of standard size for a Parisian hotel. It is petite but to say it doesn’t fit one person is a lie. Easily fitted my partner, myself and two hand luggage cases in.",2

66165,"The Address Marina offers a great location…most rooms have a lovely view of the Mariana and the hotel offers direct access to the mall.  I booked a club lounge room, but several years on the hotel does not have a dedicated lounge, as it used to.  As a guest, you have access to various venues for breakfast, tea, dinner and drinks…it’s a novel alternative, but gets tiresome. Admittedly it is probably better value than most lounge services, but don’t expect a dedicated space.  Also please know that the pool area is configured for large weekend pool parties.  Not quite an exclusive experience…just don’t have high expectations for a quiet place to swim.  Rooms are nice and well appointed but remember that the windows aren’t tinted…especially if you want to take advantage of a bath with a view.  It is a lovely feature though.  Overall, a good price for the brand and location.  Happy travels.  ",2
4576,"I had specially chosen this hotel for my stay as it was right next to the convention centre where i had a three day meeting.  I then extended my stay for four days.  Good decision I had made!  I stayed in a regular king deluxe room and i felt it was large enough.  It had a long sofa, and a large working desk with a nice chair.  Bed linen was very comfortable.  Bathroom amenities were complete.  There was a nespresso machine as well as a kettle, and four coffee pods - and multiple TWG teabags, sugar, fresh milk etc - all of which were refilled daily.  AIr-conditioning was strong and quiet.  I like the lighting commands in this room - extremely easy to use especially at bedtime.  In fact this is one of the few hotels which i have stayed with the most easy-to-control lightings.  Breakfast spread was vast.  You have to order your eggs (apart from scrambled, which was at the counter) from the waiter; some of them forget to offer you, take note.  My only grouse was that the hot dishes and the Asian section could offer greater variety on different days.  Lots of space, so no need to rush.  Beware that the waiters can be overly enthusiastic (and clear your table (and your utensils) the moment you walk off (happened to me and some other people), so do “something” to secure your table if you wish.  The gym was modest in size with some variety in equipment -  not the biggest I’ve seen, which was a tad disappointing.  Towels, wipes and water were available.  I don’t think they switch on the air-con in the morning…?  (I also coudn’t find the switch).  I note that several reviewers had complained about the incessant and early noise from surrounding construction.  Yes, the constructions are ongoing and yes, they start quite early in the day…. but i didn’t hear a single noise in my room.  I believe it’s because i was lucky enough to get a high floor (PHEW!!!)… so now you know what to do…..",2
56923,Erika Perez was amazing and very patient and professional. When I came in she was helping a couple of guys. They didn't have anything together. She was patient with them and when it was finally my turn to check in she apologized for the wait. Even tho it was not her fault. I feel she was friendly and very patient. I was frustrated for her with the  customers in front of me. However she maintained and spoke to them in a calm manner and was very professional.,2
66010,"Wonderful room and view but had a disappointing customer service experience. Left a package with a staff member who was supposed to take it down one floor of the building to the UPS facility located at the hotel. I was going to be gone to a meeting during the UPS store’s business hours and it was a small, lightweight letter size box with a prepaid label so there was no transaction needing to be done, just a drop off. Instead of the staff following through, they sent it with a postal service worker who had nothing to do with UPS. It was a huge headache researching and locating my package and I wish I had just paid extra for a pick up to be scheduled. But I had faith that the staff was going to follow through and they didn’t. If they didn’t want to help, they should have said they were unable to so I could’ve made alternate arrangements. I had paid for next day, air shipping and the package finally arrived five days after it was supposed to. I received one call from a manager trying to help, but I had to call many other times and explain the issue over and over to check the status. No one ever has followed up to see if it was located or offered anything for my inconvenience. Just because the place seems 5 Star doesn’t mean you can trust that the service will match. ",2
21839,"This was first time in Seoul and I'm glad I chose Hotel ShinShin.  I was warmly greeted at the front desk, had an easy check in, and then led to my room.  The room a little small which is not a big issue for me as a hotel room is really just for sleeping.  Some may find the open bathroom concept an issue if traveling with friends, but I had no problem with this.  Location is central as it's within a two mile radius of many main attractions including the palaces and markets.  Issues: When I arrived, the shower would not drain.  They sent someone to repair it immediately which resolved the situation for a day, but the issue happened again.  Again the fixed it immediately.  On one night we lost all water, but fortunately we were out partying until 3AM which didn't really affect us, but it is worth mentioning.",2
5884,"When my wife and I checked in I thought that there may have been a little more attention and assistance provided rather than just the courteous but basic check in procedure. I recently enrolled as a LeClub Accor member but was not acknowledged as a member. Should I have been? I don't know. But more importantly my wife was on crutches, and in fact the hotel had prior knowledge of my wife's condition. I had brought up our 2 suitcases and 1 overnight bag up the lift on my own. I didn't mind that but I would have thought that the staff would have rendered immediate assistance with the bags, instead I had to ask for the bags to be taken to our room. I also expected that given my wife's condition we could have been provided with advice on access to nearest transport, subway stations and exits. The room itself was clean and stocked with the appropriate amenities.The room was a queen superior but was quite smallish and with very little room for luggage. the hotel faces an office building so there are no views to speak of, even at higher floors. The buffet breakfast didn't have a large variety of food but was adequate in terms of quality. The restaurant staff were quite friendly. The biggest plus about the hotel is its proximity to the heart of Ginza.  ",2

28379,"The hotel is really great at first! Very nice staff and helpful. However, the elevators were broken during our stay and only one way available. I just used the stairs to get to my room and almost passed out due to my asthma. Even if I had waited 10-15 min for the one elevator it’s so packed I can’t breathe in there either. If the hotel only has one working elevator they should have staff organizing the traffic for the single elevator. It is absolutely ridiculous to have broken equipment and not have a solution to move people along easier. Expecting people to pile on top of each other in an elevator the size of a tiny closet is dangerous and negligent. Also having people pack into the elevator like that is against ADA compliance, and should be reported. ",2

On return to the hotel later they offered to help with our luggage to our room. No mention of status but was upgraded to an executive room and also provided a bottle of prosecco for a special occasion. The room was very spacious, modern and clean. Tried to use the app to order extra towels but the request didn't seem to go to anyone, recommend you just call instead. The concierge service at the front desk was really good as they managed to get us into a restaurant last minute that was fully booked for that evening. Breakfast spread was very good with a lot of choices and plenty of seating available. Would definitely consider staying here if visiting Rome again.",2

Air conditioning is brilliant in the room, didn't even need to open the window once during our stay. Such a refreshing place. Thank you very much to the staff for evrything. Loved it. Hope to be back again!",2
1965,"GOOD: Clean and in good order (it's quite new) Staff were cheerful and helpful, there was always an English speaker around. Location is near shops, bars and public transport Laundry facility is useful and cheap Breakfast was of a good standard and only 1000 Yen although western food is limited Rooms have air purifiers which is a nice touch  BAD: Rooms are small, smaller than they look. No cupboards or storage. Two people and two suitcases were a very tight fit! No English TV channels, only on pay per view although there were a number of movies in English available free of charge.",2
27812,"This is the 3rd time I booked this hotel for my business trips to Tokyo. It is close to the train and subway stations, on a quiet street and has a 7-11 next door. The rooms are clean, they have the WSJ each morning for reading and a restaurant on-site.",2
41666,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in June, and we were pleased discover that all of the 5 star reviews were spot on. We were greeted by Chrisoula, who gave a very helpful orientation of things to to on the island. Also, they booked our airport transportation and quad rentals, which made our stay even more convenient. We were in room 105, which was very spacious and luxurious, and had an amazing view of the Caldera.  Breakfast was prompt every morning and delicious, and the location was very conveniently located which made touring around very easy.",2

21896,"We caught the train to Central for a concert. The hotel is an easy 5 min walk from the station. Lights everywhere and restaurants open late (within 1 min walk).  Room was very clean and everything we needed. One event we went for was cancelled so they let us check in early and then as train didn’t leave till after 11.30 the next morning a late checkout till 11 was allowed.   Staff were very friendly and went above and beyond. Price was great. Would definitely stay there again.   Only hard part was when we arrived home from the concert at Olympic Park, the elevator was turned off but working again first thing (so not sure if it’s closed for noise? Having a recent broken ankle, walking the fire escape at night was not fun up to our floor).   Thanks for having us.",2
4364,"The hotel service was excellent. The concierge was very warm, the front desk was quick to check in, and the guest staff were very patient to deal with our problems. The pool is nice, but the playground is a little small. But I also heard that there are plans to expand the Banyan Tree until it opens. Hotel room to see the sea, for those of us who don't see the sea often really super cure, next time with good friends to play",2
55978,"Distance to hotel from train station looked to be very close. After walking two blocks and turning the corner it was straight uphill from there. Pulling bags up a brick street did not go so well. Warning, don’t walk to hotel with luggage! Hotel and staff were wonderful. Everyone greets you coming and going. Room was great. My only complaint was the gentleman at the upstairs restaurant/bar. We just want a drink, he said there was a minimum food order and was very dismissive so we left. Only complaint! ",2
56590,"This small structure on the bank of the canal in Bur Dubai, is quaint and a lovely location to have either snacks or dinner. It’s a Arabic/ Turkish menu and place which has a tent n floor seating option for those inclined for a typical Arabian experience. We went for snacks there as we were strolling down the waterfront and saw this lovely lit up place with a sit out area too. We chose the indoors as the weather at this time in Dubai is very hot. Camel meat is their specialty as well as rice wrapped in leaves and soaked in vinegar- was quiet good as was the Camel meat n the Lemon n Mint juice, which is the local drink here during the hot weather. The service and staff, Svetlana, was excellent. We wish we had come for dinner instead of snacks, but will try this place again for sure. For all those food lovers who want to visit the smaller places of a city- this should be on your list! The pricing of the food was also very very reasonable so a must try for foodies within the budget.",2
43513,"This is a very nice hotel, it has very large, nice and well maintained grounds and is ideal for business trips to Suzhou. The staff was friendly and helpful, although most of the hotel's employees were not fluent in English. On the flip side, the wifi internet is awful, extremely slow and my room lost the signal all the time. The hotel food is not a highlight either.",2
2614,"I had been here this november and i stayed here with friend up to 4 nights. This hotel is clean, easy access and lot of shopping mall nearby, ferry terminal to macau also nearby. I definitely will chose back this hotel again when i visit hong kong in future.",2
9356,Stayed for 5 nights.  Room is clean. Bedsheets crisp and fresh after returning from the city or beach.  Very quiet.  Was with husband for a brief R and R. Worth the money as u have a luxurious hotel in the center of everything. Can’t beat the location and all the amenities at Loews. ,2
3595,"This resort is very beautiful, has an awesome poolside room selection, and great friendly staff. The breakfast has quite a few options with an fantastic coffee maker, fruit, soup, eggs, and more. Slight language barrier at check in, and the lady got a little upset at us asking what the current rate was, versus what we paid for online earlier.",2
13994,"This hostel has it all guys. First and foremost, its spacious and clean. Let me break it down for you: I was traveling in a group of 6 girls. We booked the private 6 person room and even with that many girls we felt that we had plenty of space. I might even argue that it was luxurious for a hostel in Europe.  In addition, the hostel in a beautiful area that gives you the feeling of living in Barcelona while still keeping it convenient to all the touristy sights. There aren't tourists everywhere and the restaurants in the area are super chill and authentic. Real talk: it maybe took us between 5 and 10 minutes to get around and even when it was crowded in the metro, trains came every 3 minutes or so. The Barcelona metro system is inexpensive, safe, clean, and easy to figure out. By the time we left Barcelona (4 days), we were pro's at getting to and around the city center.   Lastly, the hostel was clean, spacious, and had everything that you need if you want to do things like make breakfast or dinner while you're there. Really there is no where else that I would stay! I can guarantee that you will be more than happy with this choice!  Now a final, final word on our gracious host. Everything that all the other reviews have said are true. Jose is warm, kind, and full of recommendations! Immediately when you get there Jose give you an in-depth break down of the sights and neighborhoods. More than that though, he tell you his favorite places to eat and the best ways to spend your days in Barcelona. Every one of his recommendations that we tried turned out to be amazing!   Trust me, you should stay here because when you stay at Coroleu house you don't feel like you're at a hostel. You feel like you're visiting one of your friends who happens to have a huge house in the middle of Barcelona. Lucky you!",2
34155,Positive: Helpful staff Nice and spacey room Flexible arrangement for early check-in or late check-out  Negative: One of the bath towels smelled terrible.  The restaurant was overwhelmed during breakfast session. My order was missed until further reminding  ,2
44049,Fully-equipped studio apartments meticulously clean and superbly located in the center of athens.Within the price of the studios breakfast is included.Underneath the studios there is a restaurant and a bar which offers fantastic cocktails.The service is very quick and friendly and all staff speak english.Any information you may need can be obtained from reception which is open 24 hours a day,2
54764,"Excellent oasis in the middle of a mad place!  Great pool with water jets, ideal after hours of walking Ocean Drive which is only about 2 blocks away.  Varied breakfast with good choices and tea and coffee available 24/7.   Clean, bright room with everything you need.  If you arrive late be sure to check where the key is left - a couple of us got caught out!  Manager is great, ordering taxis and let me have room to freshen up before I left as it wasn't booked.   Highly recommend.",2
53439,"The hotel is conveniently located near Columbus Circle and Central Park - walking distance! The rooms are slightly dated and need a bit of refurbishment but they’re comfortable nonetheless.   Donaldo was an exceptional manager in dealing with the issue I experienced and did everything to make my stay comfortable. Thank you so much, Donaldo!",2
66602,This hotel was decent comparative towards its price. It was easily accessible towards a shopping mall with places to eat and shop and in side the hotel the facilities were good with an inbuilt restaurant.  There was also a rooftop pool bar and restaurant which was good and prices were normally done,2
46392,"How could I start ... I was supposed to stay only 2 days, with my mother, before moving in my new apartment. Finally, my mother left but I had to stay 6 more days. For my whole stay, the team has been awesome with me, always willing to help, always smiling. When I finally found an apartment, they let me leave my car in the parking for a few days, even if I was no longer a customer.  The food at the Restaurant is very good, and the 24/24 restaurant services saved me late at night when I came home a little bit drunk. The breakfast is very complete and tasty. The rooms are classic but with comfortable beds and everything working well. The terrasse on the top of the building, with the swimming pool, is very cool also.  I never felt that much at home in a hotel, thanks for everything, dear team. You're great ! They gave me many advice about moving in in Barcelona and were always very available, for anything.  About the location, the Hotel is located at about 50 meters from the Bogatell Metro Station, so you're straight on the L4 line, and can join easily other lines in less than 10 minutes by metro !  Merci Beaucoup ! Mathias",2
23776,"I always search for hotels based on location, then price (often around 100 EUR), and finally the best rated on Tripadvisor among them. To stay close to Arc the Triumph I found this hotel. Stayed here three nights for the Paris Marathon.   It is a small hotel a little bit teared. Rooms spacios, and what you need.  Bathroom ok with shower in my room, and not lack of hot water. Wifi workiing very well, good speed. On the minus side is that the room I had was a little bit dusty. I understand that the air in Paris is not the best, but I think it should pay off to spend some time every month or so and clean the furniture etc from the dust. It is not much time but will make the stay much more pleasant. Another thing is the limited number of AC outlets. You could not sit and work or be in bed if you had not a long cord with you.Another thing was that you heard people talking from the other rooms, and I can tell you it seems like French couples have a lot to talk about in the evenings!  Metro around the corner. Walking distance also to the Opera area. (10 minutes)  Staff friendly and helpful. And very keen on to make sure the breakfast was served the correct time. Coffee/tea/choclate with bread. A nice start, excactly what you need and on time delivered  to the room.   In summary, a good hotel for the price and location.",2
43713,"If you are not looking for the luxury suites with infinite pools, this is the perfect stay in Santorini. Conveniently located very close to the center of Fira but in a quite area, it allows you to easily reach every part of the island. However, beside the location, the staff makes the real difference.  Always very nice and helpful, at each time of the day, they continuously offer you advice, along with hot and cold drinks (including Santorini wine).  The hotel also arranges excursions. We did the island tour with Leftheris and we had the chance to visit the main sites on the island on a comfortable bus and in a relaxed atmosphere. Leftheris has been a great guide and a friend for the whole holiday. We could not say enaugh good words also for the rest of the staff. We will remember Santorini for its blue domes, the cliff and the laughs with Antonia’s staff.",2
60557,"The hotel offers Wi-Fi but is drops out all the times. There is service could Concierge staff in the foyer, but he seemed preoccupied with the messages he was receiving on his phone.  There are two excellent receptionists, one is Annie, who helped me with several requests. The remaining reception staff are elderly and should retire, they have no passion for the job.  There is also a young receptionist called Joe, he served a delivery person ahead of me. I asked him why and he said “ you were in line” I said yes that’s right, I was waiting in line, so why didn’t you serve me. He did not want to take any responsibilities for his poor customer service skills. To add insult, the next day he asked me if I was feeling better.  On the positive side, the rooms are excellent, large bathrooms and the bed is the best I have ever slept in. The pillows and sheets are like heaven. Very close to McCormick Place and China Town. There is a fire department next to the hotel that regularly is called out and sound their sirens all day and night. It did not stop me from getting a good nights sleep. Not many eating areas around and the hotel does not have a restaurant.  They do have a café, and I also found the male staff member who served me wanted to start an argument because he thought I ordered two coffees. What is letting this hotel down is the lack of restaurants around the area and poor customer service.  ",2
67575,"We decided to stay at this Hotel, instead of Marriott Courtyard Namdaemun (where we stayed last), to be in the middle of Myeongdong. We were so happy with the decision.  The Hotel is great - great location and great price. We booked a Family Room with discounted rate for being the Hotel preferred guest. When we checked in late (after 11PM), the Room was already prepared for us on the high floor with a bottle of wine. We were also given cakes and drinks as welcome gifts, which we picked up 2 days later.  The Family Room was spacious, with 3 beds. It was perfect for the 3 of us - one bed for each. It was clean. Bottled water was put in the room daily. I am not sure whether because I am a Hotel preferred guest or not. But the additional care is nice.  The location is perfect, as we could walk to any restaurants and shops, and the street vendors. They are literally just outside the hotel door. Lotte Department Store is just a few minutes away. My wife and daughter enjoyed their shopping as they just walked back to drop stuff and continued their shopping. Other shopping (Namdaemun Market) and attractions are nearby. We were able to walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace back to the Hotel.  The only disappointment is the light daily schedule for the complimentary shuttle to/from airport, as we were not able to take advantage of it. I wish the Hotel would add more trips to the schedule.  This hotel is DEFINITE our Seoul hotel from now on.",2
39823,"Arriving at Incheon airport, we walked to the taxi stand and paid 100,000 won for a ride to Pacific Hotel.  The hotel was in a good location, being near the Myeongdong shopping area but away from the bustle. The Myeongdong station is just steps away from the hotel and going to the shopping area is just a matter of crossing the street or the underground, with convenience marts and eating places around the property.  Checking in got a little unpleasant as we encountered some problems with the staff on duty. The matter was resolved after a long while and the management responded to the incident the next day.   After finally dropping our luggages off at the room, we headed for breakfast. There was a decent selection of food and sufficient seating for the hotel guests. We noted while the staff are polite and go about their work well, they don't really smile. However, if you need anything, they would be happy to help.   Our first room was nice and clean enough, but fairly compact. There may be barely space to lay out anything more than 2 big luggages. Bed was comfortable, a double bed would be put together by combining 2 single beds. The bathroom has a bathtub and the toilet has a warmer that comes with a bidet and dryer. The housekeeper on the 5th floor was courteous and friendly.  The Pacific Hotel experience started to get better as we go - we met a lady staff member at breakfast who was welcoming and courteous, and she smiles. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a good look at her name.  We moved to another room with the help of Mr Yoon Jae. The studio suite was very spacious, and as clean. The room is good for 4 and has no lack of space for our luggages and to hold our shopping.   With 2 toilets and separate bath and shower, and also 2 double beds, the room provides space that most travellers would be happy with and definitely one to consider for maximum comfort.   Checking out was, thankfully, quick and pleasant with the help of Mr Lee and another gentleman. Again, I didn't get his name as we were in a rush. He helped us with our luggages and sent us off in the taxi.  Overall, Pacific Hotel was still a great choice, with good location and clean, comfortable rooms. With some service improvements, the property would realise greater potential.",2
34629,"Arrived was properly greeted and given upgrade as IHG member. Room was large well appointed but didn't make sense on layout 1/2 room empty space. Any was was cleaner than most hotels in China and staff was friendly.   One simple issue was there is a Irish pub attached to hotel and first night arrived went in and told by bar staff Beer machine broken. Then was told by Manager (duty manager) it had been broken for a few days. Bar was empty and we left. Next night ask a young lady again (Duty Manager) and said machine just broke and she was trying to get it fixed. When informed her that last night was told different story she changed her story. Then when questioned on why lie to customer her only response was ""Sorry"". So maybe some training is in order. Food is OK and Italian place on 5th floor is really decent.   A good safe place to stay ",2

2937,"Writing this while laying on the beach, while I have time still here on holiday.   Wasn’t sure what expect, a few mixed reviews and a friend that stayed here in 2019.  But this is what I think, it is about 90 to 120min transfer from airport, which for me was enough.  The hotel entrance is very pleasant and well kept.  We checked in with no hassle, room was nice, clean and nice size, mini bar(re stocked) every day, which is included in your package.  We was not happy with the noise outside our room, as it overlooked another hotels, domestic/kitchen area with an extraction fan going all the time, complained to reception manager about, he’s was accommodating and and moved us to a room overlooking the pool, which we greatly appreciated (no noise issues since) so thank you,  to him.  The pool is not big or deep, but it Is clean and well kept, we prefer the beach.  The back of hotel is on the beach, it’s a pebble beach, which I prefer, but it’s not that big, most of beach is taken up with sun beds on a decked terrace, which is quite packed in, if you want a decent sun bed, be prepared to get up early, hotel says you can’t reserve sun beds, but that doesn’t stop guests. 7.45am and most beds have towels on the beds (hotel does not enforce it’s own policy) which is disappointing on their part, someone should sort this out. Towels on beds at 7,45 and the people turn up at 2pm 😡and often reserve 2 beds, 1 in the shade and 1 in the sun.  Beach is clean and gets deep quickly.   Food and drink, it’s everywhere, inside, outside, on the beach. And during the day wide choice of, Chinese, burgers, jacket potatoes, Italian, salad, kebabs, the list goes on. Breakfast and evening dinner can be taken inside or outside, i found the evening meals became a bit repetitive, breakfast is fine.  A lot of the drinks are international brands, which was good, house wine was ok( drinkable) beer choice was local Efes, Guinness, Tubog, bud, and a few other beers.  Loads of cocktails options.  Good coffee shop in hotel, included in package.  Basically the only things you have to pay extra for are the SPA and water sports.  The hotel Spa was expensive, we nearly booked the hour massage (£86) each  Until we found the Place across the road, it was £70 for the 2 of us, which included sauna, pool, Turkish Bath, body scrub, face mask and 1 hour massage. (Wear your swimming costume)  Hotel staff, in general are polite and helpful, some speak very good English, some hardly any at all,( that’s not a criticism)   The hotel guests are a mix of Russians, Turkish, British and a few other European countries, by far the majority are Russians, they are rude ( the hotel staff will tell you that) and I’ve see them treat the staff like crap. They didn’t really bother me, just gave as good as they did.    Would I come back, not sure yet. I have another 6 days here so I’ll update my opinion at end of holiday.",2
28554,"Stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Istanbul. This small basic hotel is located minutes from Sultanahmet square and is right behind the blue mosque. It has a cool looking Ottoman style from the outside. The staff was friendly, and my room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the typical Turkish hotel breakfast. I slept well and would stay again.",2
60871,"Hotels are few and far between in this part of town, so I was happy to get a room at The Metro. It is charming and visually appealing and has a European flavor. I liked the coziness of it. However, the agent that took my reservation was not willing to match the price posted online, which was $24 cheaper. Because I'd been told it was the last room available, I paid the higher price, but this did not make me feel good about the experience.  If you like to tuck in early, try to request a room that doesn't overlook the outdoor patio of the restaurant next door. It was just outside my window and the guests were enjoying a noisy evening when I was ready to sleep. I had to keep the window closed due to the noise and it was a warm temperature outside, so I would've preferred to keep it open. A screen would be a nice addition.  I agree with a prior review that stated the linens were cheaper than expected for the room rate here. My bedsheets had large holes and the towels were rough and scratchy.  I would stay here again if my Airbnb isn't available. I prefer to have access to a kitchen or at least a fridge and this room did not have that. It is a lovely atmosphere, but would have received an Excellent rating from me with the above mentioned adjustments.",2
2370,"The staff was very nice and accommodating. We were only in Athens for one night so wanted a location close to everything. The location was perfect walking distance to everything. We were able to walk to the Acroplis, restaurants and shopping. Great location! ",2
48008,"My friend recommended Cape Panwa Hotel, and I had high hopes for our family's stay, which we booked through Luxury Escapes Australia. We had a full-board package and were excited to enjoy the resort's amenities.  The hotel is located in a serene area of Phuket, about an hour's drive from the airport. However, transportation organized by the hotel can be expensive, and it may be more cost-effective to hire a taxi or minivan for less than 1,000 baht.  The beach at Cape Panwa looks stunning, with coconut palms and crystal-clear water, but as other reviewers have noted, there are some issues. The beach is not cleaned after high tide brings in debris, and swimming is impossible during low tide due to sharp rocks and corals. Unfortunately, I cut my foot while swimming. Despite this, when the tide is right, the beach is a beautiful tropical paradise, and we enjoyed spending time there.  However, as other guests have mentioned, there aren't enough sunbeds for all guests. During peak season, it may be more challenging to find sunbeds for the family, and the resort staff seemed understaffed and unable to assist. Additionally, guests from the nearby sister property reserved sunbeds early in the morning by placing towels or belongings on them.  The breakfast experience wasn't up to the standard of other five-star hotels in Thailand. While nothing was terrible, the presentation and variety were lacking, and every dish tasted average. The staff charged extra for anything other than filter coffee, salt and pepper shakers on the table were rarely full, and paper napkins were used instead of cloth. We waited for a while to be greeted by a staff member to have our room number noted, but no one came over. We eventually found our table and helped ourselves to the buffet.  Service for lunch and dinner was slow, and we waited for 60 to 90 minutes for dishes to arrive. We decided to embrace the ""Phuket time"" mentality rather than get stressed, but other guests were visibly frustrated. The same dish or drink ordered at different times could be entirely different, and we had mixed experiences with the Gin Fizz cocktails.  The staff members were friendly and attentive, but it was evident that they were overworked and stressed. Sandy, who looked after the beach, as well as Somchai and Jenny, who served us during breakfast, were exceptional and provided excellent service.  Our family room was spacious, comfortable, and had modern amenities, along with stunning ocean views. However, we noticed that the bathroom drains emitted an unpleasant odour, and we had to use mosquito repellent when sitting outside.  As part of our package, we received complimentary massages at the spa, and the skilled therapist was able to alleviate my back pain with one of the most exceptional massages I have ever experienced.  Although we enjoyed our time at Cape Panwa Hotel, the resort is in need of updates and repairs. We believe that there are better alternatives to this hotel in Phuket, although we left feeling relaxed and satisfied.  Overall, our experience was positive, and the staff tried their best, but the resort could benefit from some improvements to make it a truly exceptional destination.",2

43531,"I have stayed at this hotel first time for business reasons. This hotel is located at great place, in very nice and quiet area, close to nice lake. I had no too much time to investigate a neighbourhood but just a few from window is excellent. Rooms are big and bed is very comfortable. Bathroom is also big a pretty well furnished. Breakfast is rich with really wide selection. There is also good Paulaner Bräuhaus restaurant were we spent a good time with good German bier, listening a life western music. No time to check Gym or Spa. Btw there is also golf course nearby, but it is not my favourite sport.  Unfortunately distance to Pudong airport is really big and you need to reserve a plenty for transfer. I recommend this hotel and it ration between costs and service provided is really good.",2
62472,"My siblings and I booked a surprise stay at the MBS for my parents as their wedding anniversary gift, and decided to go all out on the High Life Package in the Sands Premier Suite for a special once-in-a-lifetime experience.  This review is therefore specifically on the service we received from the Premium Services Team and my parent’s stay in the newly renovated suites (the experience will obviously vary depending on your room type and package).  Firstly, the new suites are beautiful!! We had an eye-level view of the Supertree Grove, and the amenities and layout of the suite really lived up to our expectations of a luxe hotel.  But what really elevated our stay (and made the price of the room seem more justifiable) was the service we received.  We felt the VIP experience from the moment our MBS limousine transfer driver picked us up from our other (more modest) accommodation, to the warm welcome we received from our Premium Services rep, Joanne Catalan, at the MBS entrance.  The Premium Services Team (in particular Joanna) provided exceptional customer service throughout our stay! They showed great professionalism, were always willing to assist with our queries and requests, and truly, truly went above and beyond to make my parent’s  anniversary stay at the MBS a very special and memorable occasion for our whole family.  We are especially grateful for the  personalized anniversary surprises, family photo request, and the complimentary limousine transfer upon our departure (this was not a package inclusion but Joanna and her team went out of their way to meet an unusual request, which we were beyond grateful for).  Thank you so much to Joanna and all of the Premium Services Team for everything!! Truly wonderful service that lives up to the MBS brand!!! We hope to come back in the future!! ",2
58959,"Alessandro is a tremendous and gracious host. The breakfast is definitely filling, while the view and space of the room is more than adequate. He even went above and beyond as to assist us with local reservations as well as helping navigate our way around Rome.  The neighborhood is lively and very close to numerous good eats as well as a couple of blocks away from the nearest subway (Colosseo is 2 stops away).  Also, an amazing gelato spot is within walking distance.  I would stay here again without question!",2
64201,"I stayed here on 2 occasions, one during June and the other during December. I am very satisfied with both stays, thanks to below factors:  1. Location - This Dorsett is located in Kwun Tong Area of Hong Kong, which makes it conveniently accessible to nearby Ngau Tau Kok and Kowloon Bay business areas; ideal hotel if you are travelling for business. A quick 5-10 minute walk to Kwun Tong MTR station and a short walk to nearby Kwun Tong Ferry Pier.  2. Rooms - Clean, cozy, and functional. Expect small rooms coz this is Hong Kong.  3. Staff - Very nice, polite, and tries hard to accommodate your requests.  4. Overall feel - The hotel looks good, smells good, and feels good.  5. At first I was hesitant to stay here, but after 2 stays, I am well convinced that you are getting your money's worth. ^_^  Thanks Dorsett Kwun Tong!",2
3335,"I stayed in Park Royal with my spouse and daughter. We stayed at the deluxe room that is good enough to adjust 3 adults with an extra bed. The room was extremely lean and had most of the amenities. The experience right from the check-in to check-out was perfect. The location is great as the MRT station is at 2 minutes walking distance. The sleep quality is fantastic. Since it’s near to the little India, food wasn’t an issue at all. Two big departmental stores, Mustafa and Fair Price gives an access to small things that one needs during the stay abroad.  Thanks to Ms. Tori who allotted the room on the 18th floor as it had a great view thru the window. The view from the room was too good as could see London flyer, Dome, etc.   Thanks to club Mahindra and Park Royal for this lovely experience. I really recommend both of them to everyone.",2

I wouldn’t be fussed about saying very central to Milan, save your money and stay somewhere like Ramada.   The only downsides I would say is that it advertises a shuttle bus but note this is only available on weekends during certain hours (same with pool and spa). The receptionists are rude - apart from one called Mia who is really lovely (the rest should learn from her). The rest are abrupt and hung up on us on various occasions.   Some of the prices for breakfast in bed are also extortionate so my advise is make your own breakfast or eat out. ",2
54071,"We had a great stay at Makers Hotel in Seoul. The staff was really friendly and spoke decent English. The room itself was really modern and spacious with a large comfy bed and huge TV with Netflix. Bathroom was clean and relatively large too.  The location of the hotel is great, right outside of the metro exit (take exit 4) which makes it easy to reach and easy to get around the city too. Just outside of the hotel is the very cool area of Ikseondong Hanok Village where there's lots of great cafes and restaurants plus shops.  There was no breakfast included which was a bit of a shame as we found it a bit hard to find some nice breakfast around, with most cafes only opening around 11am/12pm. But apart from that we had a great stay and would highly recommend.",2
1784,"Only downside for us was that it felt quite out of the way - it was about a 15-20 min walk into the main areas of Barcelona - we don’t mind a walk so not too much of a problem for us. A metro station is close by so you could make use of this.   Hotel itself is perfect - clean, staff are friendly, has a rooftop pool and bar area and we had a huge bed! (Not two beds pushed together for once which seems to be a common European thing!) ",2
40343,"Stayed here with a group and went diving with Sea Bees for the week. Being small has its advantages.   The staff is very helpful and soon know your name and make you feel very welcomed.  Usually had breakfast on the boat, but off days ate on the buffet, glad to always see yogurt and fruit in addition to regular breakfast fare. Had several dinners and some lunches here, could get service to the pool or eat on my cool patio.  The grounds are immaculate and the rooms are very clean, but be sure to bring your own shampoo as no little bottles in your room.  You do get new bottled water everyday and there is a mini-fridge too. Loved the hammock on my patio, great for napping after a massage.  Had 4 massages during my week visit @ $7.50 for a Thai massage or $10.50 for oil, what a great treat in paradise.",2
31043,"Generally the hotel and staff are very good. It's not the biggest resort on the Vegas strip but it's definitely a good place to eat, drink, gamble and have fun! There are good restaurants and bars all around the casino area. It's centrally located on the Vegas strip. The decor and Paris themed architecture are truly amazing! The bed was very comfortable, the room was large ( economy  room) To bad the carpeting in the hallways and rooms are very tired and worn. Time to change them people! We would definitely stay here again. Cheers Le Paris!",2
65921,We hosted our daughter's wedding here and I cannot use enough superlatives to describe the outstanding service we received all weekend.  The staff was more than helpful and the accommodations were exceptional.  Did I mention how exceptional the staff was!  Every one of our needs were met with a smile!,2
50803,"A great apartment with plenty of space and we well looked after by staff, and thankful for parking. Plus a nice area for suburban ealks and finding plenty of local.places to eat. Just a couple of little things like empty cans left on the balcony, no face washers, no kitchen bin (not worried about for a one night stay) and one of the keys not working so I ended up locked out of the room after going for a swim. Even when a staff member came with a new key it didn't work and had to use her master key! But overall a lovely stay - I would definitely go again as I know those little things could be fixed if staying longer.",2
6777,"I stayed in Blanc inn for 6 days during my stay and I had a comfortable experience. I was mostly in the inn during the evening and morning and saw a staff clean almost everyday so there are no problems with dirt. The alcoves are spacious for a hostel, bed was comfortable and very clean and I liked the fact that I could adjust the AC and the ceiling fan at my convenience. I had a cold so I didn't mind just using the fan at times. I just heard a bit of snoring from one of the guests that woke me up a bit, but overall, my sleep quality was satisfying.  I was also able to get a towel for S$1 which is a small price to pay for something I don't want to carry about. There's a 711 and another store next door for other toiletries I needed. I was also able to buy cheap breakfast at the nearby hawker area. The wash and shampoo was already provided so that saved me a lot. There was a problem with the light one time in the toilet  but a quick note to the owners was sent and they were able to fix the problem at once.   WIFI is fast and I particularly liked that they provided coffee and tea for free. I believe the owners also left some fruit for the guests as well, which was a nice gesture.   Service was also superb for the hostel. I emailed them about arriving late because of my early morning flight and doing late check-in and they allowed me to book that night at a lower cost! The staff was very professional, greeted you with a smile and had ready answers to all my questions. The overall services felt like a hotel for me, and I would recommend Blanc inn over other hotels with bad service in other areas of Singapore.",2
7252,"One of the best experiences, a must when visiting Qatar. I must say, the hotels are more family orientated in terms of amenities and things to do are slightly limited for couples, especially being on its own island and a 30 minute boat ride away from mainland Qatar. The rooms are very nice, from the basic rooms to the best, all are very clean, spacious, well equipped and all have that anantara touch. Overall a great stay. Shoutout to Pravin, went above and beyond.",2
52879,Got a special offer so booked this hotel as needed to be in the area for a conference. Had heard good things about it from friends who had stayed. Place Is clean and there is a separate entrance for the hotel. Comfortable bed and perfect for a solo trip. Found the shower too small to turn round in. Nice soap provided.  Buses are nearby but had to work out the right direction to go in! Nice to have a juice or coffee at the bar section in the morning and can sit outside. Enjoyed some nice meals for brunch and lunch.,2
58951,"This is my second time staying at the Althea Inn and it was just as lovely as the last time. Its close proximity to the train and metro station made it easy for me to get around. Every morning breakfast was brought to my room which consisted of fresh orange juice, fruit, meat and pastries.  The room I stayed in had a bathtub which was relaxing after a 15 hour flight with a 2 hour delay.  Alessandro was very informative about restaurants and interesting places to explore in the neighborhood. Anna thank you for the extra towels.",2
37412,"Liz and Tony have created a lovely oasis for travelers to Barcelona.  Comfortably and charmingly decorated,the flat is located a minute away from the metro.  Indeed, their metro stop seems to be just about 20 minutes from everything we wanted to see in Barcelona. It is quiet; the perfect place to return to after a long day of shopping and sightseeing.   Lots of lovely plants outside and on the patio roof. Liz and Tony provide a great breakfast and seem to magically be aware of the likes and dislikes of their guests. They noticed right away what we were not eating and replaced it the next day with something else more to our tastes (we were more into hearty foods than sweet) The beds are comfortable and one of the rooms has enough space to add a single bed.  Air conditioning or heating as needed.  Lots of blankets for those who need them. They were always helpful and we were able to find great local places to eat at a decent price thanks to them. Liz is very knowledgeable about when the best times are for various events or sights and gave us great tips on where to shop.  My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Patio and are planning to return their on individual trips with our spouses.",2
54171,"Wonderful staff! Everyone was very kind and helpful. Rambo, the breakfast buffet host was so very friendly and sweet! Everyone stood and greeted you when you entered. Reception host helped us to take the tram and gave us a tram card. Tea or coffee was offered constantly! Even Mama, the owner helped call us a taxi! The only con was the air conditioner was turned off because of the time of year is too cold, although the rooms stay warm so you just need to open the window. Wonderful place with closest proximity to Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace and Blue Mosque.",2
25087,"Very central and convenient hotel. Great breakfast, even had vegan options. Variety of teas. Good wifi reception. Spacious room. Uses rituals products  Unfortunately still has curtains at the bathtub.",2
15041,Rented 3 king rooms for birthday party. We had 12 teenagers staying over. It was a perfect stay and party. 2 rooms joined together so there was lots of room for the kids. The third room was right next door so adults could have their quiet time. Beds were so soft and everyone sleeper little babies.,2
8126,"Service, cleanliness, location, value - and did I mention service?? The two of us stayed 5 nights of the week leading up to Christmas, 2022. Seoul's weather was frigid - highs in the teens and twenties, with 2 inches of snowfall on our 2nd day. Pros: * SERVICE:  The staff there, many of whom speak a comfortable level of English, were relentlessly courteous, friendly, and helpful. Understanding the weather when we arrived, they offered hand warmers at check-in with bottles of water. Throughout our stay, they never hesitated to share dining recommendations and suggestions for how to get around. They were eager to call us a taxi whenever needed. They also provided a convenient map of the area (and city subway routes), noting where to go and what to see. Eagerness is the key word - they were eager to provide excellent service. * CLEANLINESS and COMFORT:  The room, while smaller than what we may be accustomed to in the US, was immaculate! The shower was tall and flush with pressure and hot water. I'm 6'3"" and absolutely loved the roomy, high shower. The bed was on the firmer-side and we both slept well (jet lag aside). * LOCATION:  A few minutes walk from the #2 metro line that loops around so many attractions in Seoul, we couldn't have been more centrally located to the things we wanted to see! Myeongdong itself had two excellent restaurants listed in the Michelin Guide (go early!). The neighborhoods outside of walking distance were easy to reach via metro or a quick taxi. Throughout our trip we kept exclaiming, ""Wow, everything is RIGHT here!""  Cons: To inform readers, please note these did not detract from our rating in the slightest: * The restaurant attached to the 6th floor lobby is NOT associated with the hotel (other than physical proximity) - we asked. The breakfast there was just terrible. Avoid that. Breakfast for westerners was a little difficult to find around Myeongdong (we didn't try the McDonalds around the corner). A 12 min taxi to Itaewon cured that. Other than a handful of cafes, the neighborhood doesn't wake-up until about 10 AM. * The room had the view of a yellowish brick wall inside an alley so narrow we couldn't see the ground or the sky from the 3rd floor. This was ok for us, since we weren't in the room much (and booked late). * With little daylight in the room, the dim room lighting around the sink area made it hard to apply make-up or do one's hair. * Though it was well below freezing outside, we had to run the AC to keep the room from getting too hot. (An easy remedy.)  We had to stretch to add cons. We will CERTAINLY stay here again and wish we had stayed longer! We are still swooning at the quality of the experience. There are higher rated hotels in the US that can learn from the exceptional team at Hotel28! ",2
35200,"Excellent location right on the Seine, opposite the Louvre and next door to Musee D’Orsay. Staff are very friendly and helpful, breakfast is simple but tasty. We booked a superior room which was on the 5th floor, there is a small lift, the room was adequate but without the windows open very stuffy. Noise from the main road was continuous and traffic on the Seine also raised the noise level. Having said that, the location is brilliant and to be right in the heart of Paris within easy walking distance of so many landmarks amazing! We would definitely stay again. ",2
59054,"I can warmly reccommend the Blanc guesthouse. It is super clean (you can even smell the freshness!!!), nicely decorated and Beatriz is a very nice host. We had a shared bathroom, but this is no big deal as only two rooms share one bathroom. Location is great, just a few minutes walk from Gracia center and Rambla de Catalunya (upper part) away from the busy, super touristy part. The rooms are not soundproof and on weekends this might be (for people looking for calmness) slightly disturbing as Blanc questhouse is located at Calle Tuset, where a lot of clubs are.   ",2
35500,Very nice hotel with spacious room and bathroom. Not very near to tourist attractions but can take public bus or train. Walkable if you don’t mind walking. Enjoyed our stay there and reception was very helpful. ,2
31112,"I stayed here for 4 nights on a work trip.  The hotel is updated in most places but I felt I was in an updated Hampton Inn vs a mid-upscale brand like Le Meridien.  The rate was low ($160 Euro) with free breakfast and you get what you pay for.  Review below…  Bonvoy Status:  D Rooms:  B- I am Titanium Platinum status and at check in they say “we upgraded you to an executive room”.  This was a room on the 6th floor, nothing more nothing less. My coworkers with no status were also on this floor.   The room was modern and the bed was comfy, but it’s a tiny room lacking enough USB outlets (none at the desk, only 1 at bedside).  The walls are also paper thin and you could  hear people talking next door.  I had no view.   So in essence I received nothing for my status.   Shower water pressure was good and shower got hot right away which was a plus. And the room is very clean with good bath products and includes a robe and slippers.   Housekeeping: A Came every day and did a great job.   Location:  B It’s closer to the Vatican and you can walk 1 to 2 miles to most of the main sites or attractions. But it’s on a side street harder to get taxi’s.   Do Uber instead they come quickly and it’s not expensive.  The benefit to the side street is that the hotel is quieter with little outside noise.     Breakfast food:  C+ Breakfast staff: D  The breakfast is free but it’s the exact same thing every day which gets boring. There is no omelet station.   The potatoes were near raw.   Nice selection of pastries but I wish they had more or different hot food.    The staff however was not that nice.  One day we accidentally sat at a table that had a “reserved” sign despite the restaurant being two-thirds empty. The staff practically yelled at us since we had already started eating there and just had an attitude most mornings.  If they were so concerned where people sit they should bring us to tables.    If it’s “sit anywhere” don’t reserve tables.     If you are looking for a good rate the hotel is fine. It’s clean and in a decent location. It just didn’t wow me for a LM brand.",2
30590,"After sitting empty and half built for three years, the Hotel Nikko was suddenly finished early in 2015. As a Western visitor this is a curious place, as it is a Japanese themed hotel in China, so it is not really aimed at me.  First up the hotel is very new and very clean and very modern.  The rooms are large and luxurious with Japanese Bidet toilet and a huge bed.  The gym at the time only just opened and while very large, it had exactly the same kit as any small hotel gym.   The pool was unfinished and empty.   Around the west side of the hotel it is clearly unfinished.  There is a huge Japanese garden at the rear of the hotel that promises to be beautiful but is not quite finished.  I ate at all the restaurants in the place, all of them were good.   The breakfast buffet was excellent with plenty of different styles of food for everyone.  If you are a jogger, head north round to the block around the block to explore the lake feature they have built, truly beautiful.  Great 5km run all on garden paths along well maintained gardens.    This  is along Sicheng Road.   Its a hidden gem.  There are restaurants also on Xinyuan St S St Tianhe, Guangzhou,  which is very close, esp by taxi.  The wifi was free and totally open!   It was a VPN from Hong Kong so Facebook and Google all worked.  As I said... this is a Japanese themed hotel... so enjoy the experience... its going to be a touch strange but equally fascinating!",2
22838,"The purpose of our trip was to join a wedding lunch so we chose a hotel which could be in a walkable distance to the venue.   The hotel is close to Kyobashi JR station and Kyobashi Keihan line which is around 10-15 minutes by walk. It is convenient traveling to Kyoto by Keihan line and to Umeda and Shinsaibashi by JR Osaka Loop line. Also, Osaka Castle is nearby, just around 15 minutes walk. It is definitely worthwhile to go! Such a beautiful and comfortable place to take a walk!   Since we were there for a special occasion, the hotel upgraded our room and prepared some gifts for us. It was very appreciated for their kindness!   However, there are some points which I want to raise up and hope the hotel to review on that.   First of all, the hotel did not offer any help if you want to post any post card. This is so surprising that a hotel does not have this service. This should be a basic service but unfortunately they do not. This is so disappointing and shocking to hear that. We need to find a post office and buy stamps ourselves!   Secondly, if you ask for an extra key card, you have to pay for it. I think usually this only happens to 2 or 3 star hotels but yes it happened here. We were travelling as a family group, and needed to look after each other so it would have been more convenient to have an extra key card. However even we took our family's passport to the reception and requested, the answer we got was to pay for extra. Although it was not expensive, it was annoying to us.   Overall, the stay was okay.

39489,"My husband and I had an amazing 8 night stay for our honeymoon! We plan to come back next year. The food at the resort was impeccable with different cuisine themes each night at the buffet, however  if you are looking for something a little fancier, the Tamarind restaurant within the resort stood above all. The food there is second to none and there’s something for everyone. The lovely waitress Golf looked after us each night we dined at the restaurant and made us feel so very welcome with her warming smile and customer service. The pool was fantastic and always perfect temperature, especially after playing a bit of volleyball or badminton on the beach! We got up early most mornings to walk along the shore during low tide to see all the crabs, starfish and other marine life. I could go on but all in all we can’t wait to go back!",2
29167,"This is a great find and a budget hotel just north of patong. The hotel is a 3 star but its clean, the rooms are spacious and its in a quiet area of patong so you miss all the noise at night.

3340,We stayed 2 nights here. It's a large and busy hotel close to a locality called Little India. We found the proximity to Farrer Park station was great for getting around and the tube system is world class. Our room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a powerful shower. No complaints. The hotel team are very friendly and do their best to help. The room was quiet and we had no complaints. We had breakfast which presented a wide range of Asian/European choices with an excellent egg station for your personal selections. Great location and a worthwhile hotel for your short list.,2

21335,"A truly beautiful vacation spot is marred by the seedy rooms in the Laguna wing.  The rooms were clean, but very worn with some technical defects. The complex and the pools are very nice, the food in both restaurants is good. We also liked the area, sufficient parking facilities, good restaurants, massages,a very recommendable area.",2
4367,"A high-end five-star hotel in Zhuhai. Phoenix Bay, beautiful scenery. Located on the third floor of the hotel, the Chinese SPA Thai massage club has star quality service, and the room decoration style is very Zen Chinese Thai style. The lighting design is very user-friendly, which will soon let people relax, breathe deeply and quietly enjoy the essential oil massage journey.",2
63757,"This was our first time in Nanjing and we enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel Galaxy Nanjing. The staff were good, although English proficiency was a bit lacking; luckily I speak Mandarin. The room was comfortable, with a great view from the 41st floor, as we had requested a high room. I enjoyed the rain shower and the bathtub. Other reviewers mentioned the rooms were a bit worn, and I could see that as well, but overall, still a good business-style hotel. We really enjoyed the combination of Western food and local Chinese food at breakfast, as is common with most Sofitel breakfast buffets in Asia. The gym had modern equipment and weights, but it was the pool that was really quite stellar. On the 7th floor, is an Olympic-size (I think) pool, just the right temperature, underneath a huge dome that opens up to the sky. I also enjoyed a nice bath courtesy of bath salts and an eyemask that was provided gratis courtesy of the hotel. Overall, a pleasant place to stay in Nanjing.",2
21104,"Right in the middle of Stare Mesto, the old town, on Karlova (Charles) street only a few meters from Charles Bridge and a few hundred meters from Old town square. Quick and friendly check-in. We stayed on the third floor and the climbing was a bit challenging. There was no elevator and the wooden stairs with varying heights needs your attention. There is a restaurant as well with live music on weekends. The breakfast, which includes in the room price was tasty and excellent with lot of choices, omelettes to your liking. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a family suite with two bedrooms. A spacious bathroom with bathrobes. If you have windows facing the Karlova street  you can count on some noise from the street even at night time. Prague in May is full of tourists, and the room prices a rather high and you better prepare for a lot of queuing when visiting the plentiful sights of Prague. For easy traveling in the city be sure to buy a one day or three day ticket, which is valid in buses, trams and metro.",2
23869,"We enjoyed our stay here —but it’s not for everyone.   Pros-it has a majestic outside, a lobby and breakfast area that feels luxurious, it’s right across the street from the train station (which is wonderfully convenient if your stay in Milan is a short one and you’re coming and going by train). The food was good, the room service was fast, generous and  plentiful and the staff was nice (esp the gentleman taking room service orders). They are well organized at this hotel and went above and beyond to make our visit special once they learned we were celebrating a happy event. We also love walking when we travel and the hotel was an easy 30 min walk to the city center each day.  Cons-this is not the best area of town. Given its proximity to the train station, I wouldn’t want to be out around here after dark. Unless you take cabs or public transportation everywhere, you will need to walk a solid 30 min to get anywhere interesting so if that’s a problem for you (or you’ve never been to Milan and want to experience a more charming area or an area with more to do) you should consider staying elsewhere.   Our room, while clean and spacious, was a bit worn and outdated (and we had an upgraded room)—it was probably considered high end in the 90s. Also, best to have reservations for the restaurant upstairs, esp if you want to eat outside. Finally, when we inquired about the complimentary (Maserati) car service they advertise, we were told only that they could call us a cab. (We weren’t given an explanation, but I suspect the service is temporarily discontinued because of COVID.)",2
53713,"We stayed for one night and chose this hotel as it is close to the Capital Theatre. The room was small but clean. There was no coffee maker which we didn't realise until the next day and we found a small piece of broken glass on the floor. However, when we mentioned both these things at checkout note was taken and I have no doubt that the issues were fixed. Our air conditioner was quiet so obviously didn't start life in Africa (when I was in Africa air conditioners tended to be missing altogether unless you stayed in a luxury hotel!!) and while the tv was tricky to work out at first, once you did press the right buttons, it worked.  Yes the lift is small but most definitely takes two people plus luggage and while there is a limit of 2 at the moment for health reasons, the stairs are easy to find for those staying on lower floors. And it's not like you have to wait for hours for the lift in any case!! The staff were friendly, especially the wonderful night manager with whom we had a lovely chat (Sat 18/12) and we would like to commend him for calmly and efficiently handling a difficult customer who was obviously under the weather (perhaps the person who wrote the review which has obviously really annoyed me and made me feel the need to respond to his criticisms!) The foyer, coffee lounge and bar area has a nice ambience to it and many people seem to be contentedly sitting there during the afternoon working and catching up with friends. We would definitely stay here again.",2
14197,"A great centrally located hotel, The Flag lived up to all of our expectations. The design of the hotel mixes a hipster vibe with a touch of zen through all the natural elements that are incorporated. Cleanliness and comfort are top priorities- our room was spotless, the bed comfortable and overall a more spacious room than normal for Japan. The room itself had all the ammenities you could ask for (toiletries, pyjamas, coffee/tea) as well as a complimentary coffee station next to the 2nd floor lounge. The laundry facilities were reasonably priced with conplimentary detergent (you may need two drying cycles to do the job though).  Hotel staff were beyond friendly and helpful. Due to construction on our floor, staff provided us with complimentary breakfast for our first morning- a much appreciated gesture considering the disruption was not noticable.  The only fault is that the streets outside can get a little busy during the night. This is not surprising due to the central location and of course is no fault of the hotel. If you are a light sleeper perhaps request a room that does not face the street.  Overall The Flag is a great hotel and reminded us of some higher end hotels we stay at in the Rockies back home in Canada. We would not hesitate to stay again and will be sure to recommend to all future travellers.",2
44751,This was my first trip to San Francisco. My friend and I were there to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The hotel was only a few blocks away from  the theater with made it easy for us to walk back to hotel after the show. I enjoyed my stay at the Vertigo. ,2

52696,We stayed here for 2 nights to see Beyoncé in Tottenham. Extremely happy with our stay. The price of the hotel is very reasonable considering the location - Aldgate tube station was only a 2 minute walk away which was very handy. The room size was big considering we stayed in a Standard Room - plenty of space for 2 people and incredibly clean. The staff were also just as amazing - very accommodating and friendly and really made us feel welcome. I will definitely be returning to this hotel when I next stay in London! ,2
24196,"Room was as described and very comfortable.  We arrived before check-in time and was able to leave our luggage there and given our room key to access later, once room was ready.  Bags were already brought to our room when we came back later in the evening.  In our room there was a shower stall only (no tub), which was not an issue for us.  Very cute neighborhood with restaurants within walking distance, as well as the Alamo Square Park, which has really nice view of the city.",2
27736,"My 2 kids and I bought bus tickets to the hotel at the counter just at the exit of the airport arrival hall. (You can also purchase T-money card at the convenience store facing the counter. This is a travel card for subway and buses). Caught the bus to Ibis and walked less than 5 min to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, we realised my youngest had left her phone on the bus. Told the man at the reception (night manager) who quickly stopped what he was doing and called the bus company. It was night time and the bus was only willing to drop off the phone at Ibis bus stop at 5am during the start of the schedule! I knew I would be fighting off jetlag but what choice did I have? Luckily for me the night manager volunteered to walk to Ibis for me to retrieve the phone and leave it at the concierge for me to collect later. Thanks James!  The 3 of us shared a bed in the juniour suite. No complains with the rooms although housekeeping tend to forget little things which we had to call up for. Just a minor inconvenience.   The best part was the location. We went down to the night market every night to get snacks, yummy korean strawberries. With 2 train stations nearby, it was convenient to take public transport. We relied on Citymapper app for buses and trains. We even walked to the palace as there were lots of little shops along the way.   The only complaint would be breakfast. Staying 5 days eating the same thing could get a little stale but the pros so outweigh the minor cons, I won't bother checking other hotels the next time I come to Seoul.",2

My has been asking to go back to the ACTIVITY CENTER just to make more slime with MacKenzie. I pray she's here when we come back to the Grove.,2
37544,"Nice hotel, very convenient location. Food tour arranged by the hotel was the highlight of the trip. Dennis, Steven and Irene were great tour guides. The food was a walking tour to near by local spots near China Town.",2
37840,"In Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments you can get good value for reasonable price, but you have to make sure that your invoice is detailed first. It is clean, wide rooms and some kind quite unless they get the access doors sound proof you may not be able to sleep at night. Good gym, nice souna and swimming pool.",2
3456,"A nice hotel - modern, well constructed and well appointed.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast is limited but what they offer is good quality, although the 'American breakfast' was exactly the same each day (x 3).  On the map the hotel looks like it is 'tucked away' but is situated on a side road that is heavily used by local access traffic.  I found the room we were allocated on the side of the hotel next to the road too noisy for my taste, but I crave peace and quiet in a hotel room.  After our initial afternoon siesta, which yielded no actual sleep because of the road noise, I asked to switch to a quieter room and the staff were very accommodating in moving us straight away.  This room was much better but still the odd noisy motorbike could be heard.  The pool is very nice for a dip and short laps.  Disappointed that when I wanted to pay by Visa for some extras put on the room that a 3% surcharge was going to be added to use the card.  Simple, straightforward accommodation - it fits the bill as a boutique hotel in south Phuket.",2
62099,"L iving in Beijing for over 8 years now I have tried numerous establishments and am always opinionated when it comes to food, drinks, atmosphere, service etc.   I have however never written about anywhere here because I don’t go back enough to feel qualified. Sometimes I can have a bad experience at a restaurant due to one waiter having a bad day and the next time I go I have a great one.   The Bulgari hotel since opening has become a place I frequent and I have never had a bad experience there.  Food and drink are fantastic, service is excellent and I would like to make a specific mention about the bar manager Dario.   Dario gives the whole place it’s Western charm. He will come around and meet and greet. He will give recommendations according to your tastes and tastes according to your recommendations. The first time I went with some friends he made us espresso martinis and I now swear by them every time.  All in all a really great experience every time I go so if you are looking for a safe option in exceeding expectations then I will always recommend the Bulgari. ",2
39095,"We have two kids, aged 12 and 9 and some of us also have specific food requirements due to allergies.   Having a two bedroom apartment with cooking facilities that is clean and with a pool and also free internet is exactly what we need. It's cheaper then getting two hotel rooms on or nearby to Orchard. What more can I say? Recommended. ",2
59117,"We came early because of night flight from Santorini and a manager of the hotel said that the room is ready and we can get it earlier than check-in time. Thanks for that, because we were very tired.  The guest house is white and clean, the furniture is new and well designed in a country style, the terrase is not giving a beautiful view to the city, but it is nice to sit outside and to drink tea or coffe which you can get at any time for free at the hotel. There are several shared bathrooms at the hotel, if one is busy, you can use others. All in white colour (because of the name Blanc :) ).  The location of the Blanc guesthouse is comfortable, you can use metro or bus to get anywhere you want. Or you can walk to all main sightseeng places in Barcelona. It takes 15 minutes of walk to Casa Mila and 30 minutes to Sagrada Familia, and around 1 hour to Barcelonetta Beach.  Especially I loved breakfast at the hotel: fresh fruits, yogurt, grains, different breads, cheese, bakery (which were different each day and very tasty), juice. For me it also was important to have the access to hot water for tea during the day because I so love tea! Thank you for that. When we needed a help with booking tickets to Gaudi places, Beatriz (the manager) helped us and called to Casa Mila to solve our problem. When we came we got a map of the city and all the recomendations about routs and sights which is the best to visit. I have not known before about that marvelous fountain at the Ispanya square!! That was something! We went there because manager Beatriz adviced and we were happy to see that!!! How to get to the hotel from the Airport? We took experess bus which brought us to Catalynia Square. Then you have to find metro station and to take the rout which goes to Gracia station, there will be two station to the Gracia. Then it is easy to find by map, just 5-7 minutes of walk till the hotel. On the Street Tusset you will see the restaurant Tusset and near the restaurant from the left side you will see an entrance to the hotel. I liked the place very much. Thank you Мне очень все понравилось! Спасибо!",2

66052,The hotel is such a cool place with lots of history and a good location. The suite we had was large and nice. One weird thing that happened; I let them know we were celebrating my wife’s birthday. Upon arrival nothing was said to us about the bday. I text the concierge later letting them know that nothing had been done or said. A little later a very nice employee brought us a slice of cake and some macaroons. The strange thing was the cake said “Happy 50th birthday” and my wife is 35. She laughed about it but it was weird.,2
53771,"Hotel well priced and placed within 5 minutes of Central Station. The rooms are quiet small but comfortable. With everything that you need. Located in Surrey Hills near to China Town, and plenty of other great places to eat. I have now stayed there 5 separate times. Accessible for wheelchairs, the friendly helpful staff speak multiple languages.",2
9179,Hotel is bit old and tired. However it is more than made up by willingness of the staff to go extra mile....

10013,"Had never been to San Francisco and this hotel was the most helpful. From the moment we arrived to an upgraded corner jnr suite to the location of 2 minute walk into union square and the helpful staff - no complaints! The location was easy access to everywhere and every means of transport.     We did a lot of walking out of choice but we also used the cable car, the trolley, Uber and China town was 2 blocks away so we walked.   The concierge and desk staff were always there to answer any questions we had. The valet and belle boys were impeccable. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!",2
62965,"We are leaving this Hotel today. We are a family of 4 from HONOLULU HAWAII. Our kids are 4 and 14. This hotel is formal and its layout it like a football field long. The layout of the hotel stays true to the original 1915 building, but its cramped, has 14' high ceilings and very small rooms. They required us to buy 2 rooms to house the family. I wanted to buy a $1200 2 floor room with ample sq footage, but even that was not allowed (meaning occupancy by more than 2). So they are very much a luxury type hotel but for us (being from Hawaii, but totally used to travel all over the world) the rules were a burden, and detracted from our stay. The elevator to the spa was 60 yards down a hall tot he first floor, then get off and walk to another elevator to get to the basement. Nothing FLOWS here. We are on a wing and the logical entrances are blocked off (meaning not open) so we have to walk 60 yards to the main are, then down, and 60 yards back to the same location to get 2 floors down outside. Totally inconvenient and abnormal considering it being a luxury hotel. We were given 1 key for each room. To get into the hallway you need a key. To power up the room you need a key. So this meant figuring our who could go where and when, as when I asked for another key (for a total of 2 per room) it was advised it was not policy, and then met with confusion. They sent a bellman with another key. Thanks! but this made the original key unusable! So we still had only 1 key. So I went down the 60 yard hall to the main check in area to get a second key for each room. More language confusion ensued. AHHHH. My overall impression is that the PEOPLE here are so humble, kind and helpful. The rules are not flexible even to common sense. And this recipe makes it a place I wouldn't recommend unless you're a seasoned Japanese traveler. We had another episode trying house the spa. Down the 60 yard hell. Advised that we should NOT be wearing robes in the hotel common area. Looked at in shock. We went all the way back to change into normal clothes, bringing our swim suites with us this time. back down he 60 yard hall, only to find out the spa is gender separate, and no kids allowed. (of course) So by now we've walked this place so may times without getting anything done its soured us. Again. Not the people. Its the Policies. The 2020 Olympics are coming here. Id imagine these luxury hotels might want to get a little Flexible and stop with the unbending rules or it'll make for some unhappy guests. Japan. We love your culture in general. But this formality is a burden! With respect. Mahalo!",2
34050,"Checked in to find out the room was very small. Talked to the front staff and was relocated to a slightly larger room at no extra cost. Location is excellent as the Ueno station is just cross the street and many cultural attractions near by. Famous Menya Musashi ramen is close by and Ameyoko traditional market as well. Three museums, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Takyo National Museum and Museum of Nature and Science are all walking distance.",2

The location is great as in it is near to bus stand and car/taxi can also come till hotel atlantis, which just 2 minutes from the hotel. from there the hotel guy come for pickup. For any other hotel which is in between fira and imerovigli one may needs to walk alot and that is on slop.  Also the super markets and other souvenir  shops are nearby. The hotel do not have kitchen so you cant get anything other than breakfast. I think most of the hotel there do not have kitchen as there are so many nice restaurants around.  The staff is very helpful - (Dimitris, Marina). They have kettle in room but they do not refill tea/coffee.",2
34626,"Very nice hotel, rooms are great and staff great. I've read other reviews regarding staff and services, and gladly I don't agree. If you have that arrogance that your coming from the west and you're better or that everyone must understand and talk English, then you won't succeed in China. Not particularly in this hotel. You must understand the culture and the people. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel and I tried 2, the Chinese Cantonese and the Italian, and I can only say that it was very good. Breakfast is also very good. Overall great and recommend.",2
1083,"My friend and I had a wonderful time at Naiharn Beach Resort, everyone was so friendly and welcoming, it was hard to leave! I had a bit of shaky start when I fell and sprained my ankle on the first day, but the staff coyld not have been more helpful, advising on pharmacies, a good English speaking doctor, and notably not just recommending an excellent place for a massage but actually telling the masseuse about the accident so she could specifically work on that, which has gone a long way to speeding recovery! My friend hired a motorbike from the resort and she was fully guided on riding it, and thereafter had an amazing time exploring the area while I recuperated in the lovely salt water pool. The bar is the beating heart of the resort, and very much the local watering hole, where we could order anything from cocktails, to coconuts, to thai food which could be ordered in on request, perfect when after a day of island hopping I fancied tom yum soup and my friend wanted a sandwich from the resort restaurant. We had some great nights there talking with Chris, the owner, and his friends, who generously offered insights on getting the best from our stay. This isn’t an insanely touristy area, as compared to Patong or even Kata Beach, so the beach wasn’t crowded, and there are shops and restaurants close by. We felt so relaxed, safe and at home, we actually extended our stay an extra night, and we left feeling like we had family here.We’re already talking about our return trip!",2
47522,"Great boutique hotel has a king bed , clean , nice staff , attentive . Make sure you get a room with a window not facing the street it gets noisy during the night with garbage pick ups . Walking distance to restaurants, store on the corner, metro a block or 2 away . You can use Uber app everywhere, about 65 us from airport one way it’s about 13 us to attractions like Eiffel Tower and arc de triumph. It’s a little far from every thing about 13 us by Uber . Before you go on any tours get the Big Bus tour it takes you around the city you will know the areas first . Make sure you get you high end items in Paris the LV purse the Cartier watch Chanel whatever they have excellent tax returns on them and they are a lot cheaper in Paris than in Us like thousands cheaper . Hope this helps , fyi no Starbucks on every corner there are very few , food is ok , you get very little help from the waiters even if they speak english, restaurants close between 3 pm and 7 pm so eat before 3 or after 7 ",2
62970,"The Tokyo Station Hotel has been in the Tokyo station since 1915. One of JR East Japan Group, big Japanese company. The nobel Prize-winning author, Yasunari Kawabata (my high school senior) stayed here to write his works. Another famous writers like Seicho Matsumoto stayed to write their works. The Tokyo Station Hotel had an academic ambience, but the location is very convenient. Yes. it is in the station, but very quiet, clean and an upscale boutique hotel. I stayed at the Duplex type room, with a king size bed. Very comfortable. During my staying, I spent quiet and romantic night in my room and at Oak Bar. Next morning after good sleep,  I enjoyed very delicious breakfast. Perfect staying!",2
23224,"Two night midweek stay in July. Hotel is well-located within easy walking distance of big shopping, Hancock Tower, Museum of Contemporary Art, American Girl store. Pretty easy to get cabs if needed. Took the orange and red line from MDW and it was a few blocks walk to the hotel. Took a cab to ORD at the end of our stay.   Had a room with two doubles and a living room with sofabed. There was a minibar area with microwave and mini fridge (both were located on lower cabinet which was kind of strange). A desk with a chair and lamp would be a good space for working. The loveseat opened up to a sofabed—it had a thin mattress that seemed like it might be awful but it actually wasn’t too bad!   The double beds looked kind of small and the mattresses were really soft. My kiddo liked it but I don’t like soft mattresses. Bathroom had Jack and Jill doors. Large TVs in living room and bedroom. Lamps had USB charging.  Indoor pool had a fantastic view of the lake! Pool is not large but definitely large enough.   Market had coffee and drinks and light snacks like yogurt parfaits for sale.   My daughter and I were meeting her friend and friend’s mom and the room allowed us to stay together comfortably. This place suited the needs for our trip perfectly.",2

17286,"I have chosen that hotel because of the workshop which took place in the hotel´s vicinity premises (Butovice business center).  Pros  - solid, frequently replenished breakfast - easy accesibility by public transport from the Main train station, Jinonicka subway station is located  just 2 minutes walk from the hotel - easy accesibility by car, especially if you are arriving from Pilsen highway  - nice, fresh design of the hotel - faultless staff - quit, efficient air con - free bottle of water on arrival  Cons  - new, fresh design with lot of glass and stones, spreads sound quite a lot.  - allow approx. 20 minutes by subway for Prague sightseeing - I came at 9 PM, the access road to hotel was badly lit (perhaps some breakdown)  In a nutshell,  i would choose that hotel again, if i need short stay in that part of Prague.",2

Another huge plus was that we had free parking which is difficult to find in the city.",2

Found the hotel very clean. It’s right next to one of the crab restaurants with a neon sign visible from the room but the curtains are excellent and the room was really dark. The location is great with heaps of restaurants nearby and an easy walk to shinsaibashi and Dotonbori. We would definitely stay again.",2
48042,"So much to say, and very little of it complimentary I'm afraid.  Firstly, I am staggered by some of the glowing reviews on here which, to my mind at least, are not justified.  Let's start with the 'good'. The staff at the hotel are lovely, friendly and do their very best to assist where possible. Unfortunately for them, they can only work with what they have got and what they have got is a seriously tired hotel...... so I do feel for them.  Also, the location is lovely and on a more peaceful part of the island, it would be even more peaceful if bus loads of people from the sister resort weren't shipped in every day clogging up the limited facilities.  Parking is good, and I certainly recommend having a hire car as you will probably want to escape on a daily basis in search of some space and affordable drinks. A car is also a bonus given the so-called shuttle service is extremely limited and cannot cope when groups turn up.  Now the 'not so good', so let's start with the overall maintenance of the property. Cape Panwa hasn't seen a paint brush since the 2009 financial crisis, if not earlier. Everything looks so tired and unkept. The paint is flaking off, there is rust in just about every area with exposed metalwork. Several of the plug sockets in our room were so old and baggy that they couldn't hold the connector, so charging items was a challenge. Also, our phone did not work so we couldn't call reception for assistance with our bags. The air conditioning unit in the room whilst effective, was very noisy which made sleeping with it on a challenge. The room terrace was very uninviting due to the flakey paint and old grubby furniture, this a real shame as the terrace is not overlooked and we were really looking forward to spending time on it chilling out. The shower was decent, nice and powerful plus there is a useful little fridge and a room safe.   Now the beach - There are, in theory, plenty of sun beds. That said they weigh roughly the same as a family hatchback and are made out of unforgiving wood. Wood is fine, but not when the cushions offer minimal  comfort. As previously mentioned, the sister hotel transports its residents to Cape Panwa and the result is that it is hard to find an empty sun bed unless you get there at daft o'clock, which isn't really the objective of a holiday. Swimming isn't great when the tide is lower as it is rocky at knee level.  Around the pool there is the usual shenanigans of selfish people trying to reserve beds with towels before breakfast. There are signs warning people not to do this or their items will be removed, that however is an empty threat.  Food wise, we only had the breakfast which was ok.   To summarise, we were really looking forward to staying here before heading off to the west coast. Whilst we love the area and enjoyed exploring new things, the hotel was a disappointment. Cape Panwa needs investment, and it should get it as it boasts a fabulous location. You can sense that this place would have been magical in its day, and I personally feel it could be magical again.

29341,"Oh my goodness- I ate at the Shangri La today and was just delighted at the wonderful food and fantastic selection.  One area offers Asian and Indian dishes and I found several to sample.  I tried the lamb, which was tender, and the chutney complemented it beautifully.  The salad area featured appetizers, sushi, and cold seafood like shrimp.  Another area offered beef roast, German sausage, and pizza.  Honestly, there were so many dishes that I could not try them all.  Drinks included coffee, tea, juices, and soft drinks, and the dessert area presented one sugar master piece after another (photos included).",2

We appreciate that the hotel is located in more of a residential area very close to major tourist areas: walking distance to metro (4 blocks) or tourist locations (1 mile or less).

3264,"We just came back from here. It was great! First of all the position, it is in the Born district, my favorite ones in Barcelona, with so much local charm, and still not too ruined by tourists like other parts of Barcelona ( La Rambla is terrible for example). Close to everything important, great choice of bars, restaurants and markets, shopping as well. The apartment itself is very modern and fully equipped. Accept personal staff, you don't have to carry anything, they provide almost all.  2 bedrooms, very clean, very comfy, great bathroom, towels and extras, iron and board, fully equipped kitchen, LCD TV, HiFi, fast Wi-Fi internet connection, beautiful balcony etc... I would prefer a bit more solid beds (those were a bit squeaky), but mattresses were really comfy. We got one extra full cleaning for a week stay, with changing of towels and bed sheets, which is quite enough. Just think that they should add in the kitchen, basic spices like salt, pepper and olive oil, although we had to buy big packages, that we left there almost unused, and probably all the guests are doing the same. But no hard feelings about it. Service is mainly excellent, especially Paula is great. She wrote us a few mails, offering her tips and suggestions, and she provided us more than suitable information and help. Thank you a lot Paula for that! Very prompt mail communication, as well. Check in is easy, they wait for you at the location, and at check out you just leave the keys in the apartment and close the door. There are some minor (or not?) things in service that might be improved though. The working time of main office is too short (from 10am-really too late btw, until 8pm). For weekends only 4 hours a day ( one hour and than 3 hours after the break), what I found a bit strange as well although you work with tourist, right? ( and they mostly travel for the weekends). This caused the situation at the end of our stay, that we needed a taxi at 09:30 Am, and called the office, in order to ask them to call it for us (I'm not so fluent in Castellano nor Catalan), but the guy told me that he is not in the office for the moment, and he doesn't have the numbers of the taxi, but i can go to the main street and to catch the one easily. This was quite challenging with 3 big suitcases, baby strollers and small kid. It wasn't that easy actually and we almost lost our flight. At my opinion, considering really short working time, they should find the way to provide, at least basic service even out of working hours.  Don't get me wrong, we would like to recommend those apartments truly and deeply, but some small minor improvements are possible. Lost flight is really something that can destroy your final impression. Luckily it didn't to us... Other than that, this place is absolutely fantastic!",2

The rooms are well laid-out, with rain showers and air con (essential during an Istanbul Summer) and a daily newspaper each morning.

If your looking for someone to wait on you hand and foot then stay at a 5 Star Hotel in the City.

63442,"We weren’t expecting much, and were blown away with the location (literally around the corner from Sinnonhyeon station’s Exit 7, surrounded by convenience stores, 24 hour pharmacy, 24 hour F&B outlets, round the corner from the main Gangnam shopping street, 5-10 minutes walk to Gangnam Station Exit 10); size of room & bathroom (both huge); amenities (universal power points, microwave, kettle, wine glasses, drinking glasses, coffee & tea packets, free bottles of water, fridge, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, full set of toiletries, lounge area in room); and service - from front of house to housekeeping, everyone was warm, friendly, helpful and spoke English!

50117,Room is big! Bed is big too although it is just a single bed! Aircon is super cold! However blanket is too small for guest who are 170cm tall and above. Toilet is very clean! There is a 7-11 3 mins walk from property and all the popular malls in Bangkok city is walking distance too! ,2
2657,Stayed 5 nights in a double room with bathroom. Room and bathroom was super clean and smelt very fresh (with a window that opened- rare in Hong Kong). It is run by the very friendly Samuel and his lovely wife who assisted with any enquiry with useful and concise information whilst respecting your privacy. Location is 2 min walk from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR. Very handy to explore Hong Kong. This hostel absolutely deserves its #1 spot! ,2
50847,The room was very spacious and stylish Ali at Check in did a great job. He noticed that my check in day was also my birthday and quietly acknowledged the date.  Great attention to detail Ali! Bed was a bit hard,2
28683,"Stayed only for a couple of days and was out exploring the city for most of the time. The private rooms were good with bathrooms near by. Good spacious dining rooms and events were organized later in the evenings. I could not join the events as I was out. Union square, Fisherman's wharf, China town were just walking distance. Plenty of eateries and clubs near by. Overall a good place to be.",2
9572,My partner and I booked a 2 night stay through Grabone.  We have stayed before and love the facilities.   Unfortunately we have had issues with 3 of our stays.  These issues have been resolved but shouldn't have occurred in the first place.  Unfortunately the food is average and overpriced in the Our Land is Alive restaurant. Overall a lovely place to stay.,2
50242,"Good place to stay good price food and very clam place. Transport , restaurant , shopping , saloon around. Place is well security. Close to beach Everyone can enjoy here and it’s near to airport. I can recommend.",2
59701,"I wanted to express gratitude for the hospitality we received at this hotel. We booked rooms and had a two day conference here.  The service was beyond anything we expected, thank you for the kindness and courteous hospitality we received 🙏🏾  Tanith is a superstar, thank you for he way you handled our requests time and time again. You restored our trust in hospitality again🙏🏾  Thank you to the head chef for meeting our demands in creating the food exactly like we asked.   Thank you to Sedi, Bella and Shalome for serving us on both days and doing it with pride and this is from the entire team, your presence made a huge difference to us. I still salivate over that coleslaw salad from Sedi 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Thank you to Ivan for being there when we had technical difficulties with anything, we appreciated everything you did to make sure our conference was a success.   A very special mention really goes to Chris.  Right from the onset we knew you had our back no matter what, you were there at a moments notice when we needed you. Helped us with pretty much anything we wanted and as an organizer, this meant the world to me - to have someone helping me to make sure things went accordingly 🙏🏾 I look forward to making future bookings at this hotel, and it’s largely based on your professionalism and hospitality. You and your team are absolutely amazing 🥲",2
24304,"A decent place to stay, close to Metro and bus. The pool was not operational during our stay, which was not good. The breakfast options for vegetarians was very less and not so tasty. Also, adequate toiletries were not put up in the room regularly, I had to ask for that. No shower caps were there and no robes.  I stayed at Hyatt Goa previously and that was a great experience.",2
64562,"Location is at the business area with different kind of foods. There are also supermarket and convenient stores nearby. Hotel staff are polite, nice and professional. Room looks simple but clean and tidy.  There is an extra disinfection spray provided. The bed is a bit small for two person. Overall, the service and environment of this hotel are good. Hope this hotel can keep such good quality.",2
15510,Well located in the city and offering rooms of an alright size this is one of the better hostels I've stayed in. Let down a little by the breakfast which is a little underwhelming. Elevator is quite old fashioned in an interesting way which was a pleasant surprise. Showers and toilets were ensuite and good quality.,2
40741,"Quite honestly Villa Maria surprised us enormously. The nightly rates are very reasonable and the entire place is immaculate. The service from Dionisia is 10/10 and there is a very warm sense of 'feeling at home' as soon as you arrive.   For a base to explore the South of the island, Villa Maria is perfect. Renting a car/ATV is advisable and you can be sure to look forward to returning after your night out. The pool area is really special with awesome views. The showers are hot and luxurious. The beds extremely comfortable. The balcony just right.   We will certainly be recommending the Villas to everyone and with the addition of breakfast/food as of next year, this place will become even more special. Thank you so much for your hospitality, it was a truly memorable 3 nights.  ",2
35631,"Lida Guest House ticked all the boxes for us on a recent visit to Prague.  We were on a driving holiday and a town centre is never a good option when you need to park a car!  Lida Guest House  offered off-street parking but for us there was no shortage of room on the street and the neighborhood is friendly and safe.  Our host Jan, has a wealth of knowledge and provided a great Prague induction (inclusive of free beer - which was one of the best).  His knowledge of the cultural features of Prague was astounding and matched only by his apparent navigational expertise.  Pros: Great location very close to Vysehrad Castle, close to several metro stops, short walk to convenient tram stop, restaurants close by (but be wary of choice - U Kroka was tops), map and navigation tools provided, rooms are spotless, water is hot, bed was great and the breakfast offered variety and filled us up for the entire day.  Cons: WiFi was a little touchy in the room but fine down in the shared reading room, stairs could tax the less-than-fit (but provided some interval training for us)!  Lida Guest House gets our recommendation - it doesn't get any better than this!",2
21796,"Excellent service especially to front office  Cindy,  Manager Steven and Bella..I stayed there for 7 days..Lucky I got  upgraded and complimentary breakfasts too over an issue..My wifi didnt connect to my device.They went out of there way to fix it..Ordering a taxi to seoul station was no a problem.Close to many attractions.

35846,"The hotel is older however the rooms are big and clean. We were out most of the day but the room had everything we needed in it, a comfy bed and clean bathroom with coffee making facilities. It was a good and safe location, public transport and short walk to the bay. Would definitely stay again! Only down side was could hear vacuuming and drawers being opened and closed in the morning from other hotel rooms / hallway.",2
22312,"The hotel is centrally located, a stone's throw from the major attractions in town. The staff goes out of their way to pamper their customers. Check-in was swift and efficient. We were led up to our room by a lady executive from the front office and shown around the room, which is rare! (apologies, I did not make a note of your name) The rooms are spacious, with great beds and pillows. There is no noise where we were placed. Bathroom amenities are adequate and also include dental and shaving kits. There is a hair dryer, slippers and bathrobes but no ironing board. The hotel runs a full laundry service, though, The breakfast is elaborate and includes both cooked and continental items. The restaurant offers fine dining and a range of wines with efficient and friendly staff. Our special thanks to Maria, Alfonso, Kristain and Gessica, who work very hard in the restaurants with impeccable service and pleasant manners. Our thanks are also due to Gulia from housekeeping. ",2
41480,"This was my first time staying at Parker Guest House. When we arrived around 7 in the evening Dennis greeted us and showed us around. He was very knowledgeable and gave us immediately some very good restaurant tips in the neighborhood. The Standard King was spacious and the beds and pillows super comfortable. Parker Guest House has a very homy and cozy feel, like staying with a friend but with more than enough privacy if you don't want to engage with the other guests. We had a very good breakfast (maybe add one or two more vegan options?) and the wine social at night was very relaxing after walking 30,000 steps through the city. Would never stay anywhere else when in town.",2
57361,"Stayed 19 - 26 March 2023, Block D room 2336. After staying at Limak Limra in 2022 we had high hopes for this hotel. Room was lovely, modern, clean and comfortable, good shower, noisy fridge, hairdryer, robes, slippers and tv ( no english channels) cleaned and new towels everyday, housekeeping was very very good. Drinks in the numerous bars were good, rose wine was lovely, showtime was very proffessional and the singers afterwards were very good, nice atmosphere. Outdoor Pools were closed during our stay. Indoor pool was open but we didnt visit. Beach was nice, plenty of sunbeds, nice terrace with tables and chairs, bar and snackbar good, we ate at the snackbar every lunch time unless we were out. Good vibe here. Played boules for the first time on the beach and enjoyed it immensely. Pattisserie cakes were delicious open 2.30 to 4.30pm. Main restaraunt was not great, breakfast was especially bad, nice omlettes, lots of cheese,salad, cold meat, rice pudding, pastries, cereal and make your own toast, it was very dissapointing and not the usual standard for a top Limak hotel. Dinner was chaotic, lots of pushy queue jumping guests , food wise lots of chicken and meatballs in the hot section,  soup was nice, only got asked twice out of seven nights if we wanted a drink, I hate to say it as its my biggest holiday bugbear but it was the same stuff everynight, once again dissappointing for a hotel of the Limak brand. We went to the Chinese and Italian both excellent food and service, would highly recommend. It seemed to be quite under staffed and the staff didnt really intetact with us much, some were quite offhand but saying this my husband did get better service than myself. This is a lovely hotel with beautiful gardens, kept lovely and clean and tidy, there are a few cats all fat and healthy. I personally would not visit again, it welcomes UK visitors but does not cater for them, I felt other nationalities were favoured.  It is not the standard of the Limak chain we have experienced on previous holidays. Any questions please ask. ",2
28373,"Fabulously convenient moderately (for New York) priced hotel but a short walk to Central Park. Our room was spacious and well equipped and the service was friendly. Check in was easy and the room was available at about 2:00 p.m. It’s an old hotel but well modernized except for the elevators, which are hopelessly inadequate. Hard to see how they could be upgraded, though. No restaurant, but dozens within easy walking distance. There is a bar in the lobby, but it wasn’t always open. We would stay here again, for the location and room. All staff encountered were exceptionally friendly and efficient.",2
40772,"This hotel is always welcoming. I feel more like being at home because the service is always on point. From the time I check in to the day I check out, every member of staff is always ready to make my visit fun and memorable every time I visit. Always looking forward to going back.",2
41738,"We went to Santorini with my husband for a three-day getaway on our anniversary.   We stayed in the Honeymoon Jacuzzi Suite with a Private Balcony.   The room was very beautiful and clean, very “Santorini” stylish, with a cave bathroom, a built bed and mostly a very nice view of Fira and the Caldera. On its balcony it has a built in Jacuzzi, two lounge beds and a table with two chairs in order to enjoy the view 24 hours a day if you wish. We were served our breakfast in the room due to the time of the year (April) and the weather (a bit cloudy and rainy). It was quite adequate (bread, eggs, ham & cheese, croissant, cake etc) for a breakfast served in bed! The staff was kind and helpful and the price was quite reasonable for Santorini Caldera side standards.   Its location is perfect because you can go on foot both to Fira and Hmerovigli from a stoned path that connects Fira – Firostefani – Hmerovigli.   Overall a very nice stay in one of the most beautiful islands of the world !",2
59801,"We stayed at the this Hotel for 2 weeks from 9 of September 2019, this would have been an rating of excellent however there are a couple of things that need a bit of work.  Reception and Check In  After a very early start of 2am in the UK we arrived at the Hotel at around 11, at this point we were told that we could not check in until 3pm and to take a seat in reception, at this point the reception staff did not say we could use all of the facilities until we could check in, after about 15 minutes I asked the Customer Relations lady who said of course we could, so this was not so bad, however I feel that Reception staff could say this to people when they arrive and therefore you would not feel so disappointed at arrival time people waiting looked were angry and this could be avoided by telling people they can use all the facilities whilst waiting, also on Reception the Customer Relation lady is brilliant really helpful and friendly, however the reception staff are rude at all times we found this out when we had to ask reception for anything they look at you, don't answer and start speaking with each other and laughing, this only seemed to stop and I got and answer to my question when I asked if there was a manager I could speak with, they really need to work on there customer skills, as they are the first people you meet and the last people you see.  Porter  We had Froute as our porter he was brilliant, very helpful, friendly and funny and from the first day we meet him to our last night he never passed you without stopping to speak, he was brilliant.  Rooms  We were in the Executive Suite, the rooms were big, nice, great views and were cleaned to a high standard every day.  Mini Bar with Snacks  There were no snacks ever in the mini bar as listed, and there was a couple of times we had to ask for the mini bar to be restocked as it had not been done, however was done quickly after asking  Room Service  Great Service no issues at all with room service, came quickly each time we used it  Lobby Bar  The staff at the Lobby Bar are great very friendly and service was 100% from all of them, they even keep an eye on you and if you are nearly finished will ask if you would like another drink and take it your table, also give you small dishes of nuts and cheese or olives, it was a brilliant service all round and this was from arrival on the first day  Pool Bar  The staff here are ok, however if you are there and a waiter comes along you are ignored until they get the drinks for the waiters first, you can stand for a long time, I felt this strange at times as there is a manager that sits at a till he could see this happening however did not say anything, it is better just to use the lobby bar who will take your drinks out to you, although they should not have to  Pool brilliant very clean and tidy  Beach  Nice beach, the waiter on the Beach will take your order and then go up top the Pool Bar and return with your drinks so a bit of a wait as he has to walk back and forth (felt sorry for him) there is a Bar at the Beach which is staffed so not sure why they just do not use this one for guests using the Beach would seem like more sense.  Restaurant  Food, I found the food to be very good and had no issues the Pasta Chef in the evening is great and the Pasta Dishes he makes were very good, we are vegetarian so you have to kind of have a good look around to get a meal together however we did not really struggle, it would be good to see more options for vegetarians as there is a lot of meat and fish options and some of the mixed salad options which looked really good were topped on mixed with tuna so you could not have them, however overall for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner we did not have any issues, and all the food we had was very tasty and to a high standard.  Drinks in the Restaurant  In the morning easy as you help yourself to coffee tea etc, however at lunchtime and Evening Dinner you need to wait for a waiter to ask what you would like then there is a huge wait for drinks to arrive at some points you are either on your last course or have finished your meals, and then at other points they do not come and ask at all, however if you are a guest who tips the waiters they are there to ask you what you want as soon as you arrive, now it is not that we did not tip however it took so many nights to get a waiter to come with drinks in time and then to give them a tip I think we were on night 5 before we could do this, once we did we got our drinks very quickly, however the night time waiter was not on at lunchtime so this was a problem, in saying that I think that regardless of giving a tip or not they really need to improve on this, I am not sure why they just do not have even water on the tables that you can open to drink yourself.  Entertainment  There is no Entertainment apart from some background music which is not great music this Hotel would benefit from evening Entertainment, however they do not list they do Entertainment so we knew this before we went, but it is something that I think would boast bookings and keep people out in the evening.  Summary  All in All we had a great time on our holiday and really enjoyed it overall the Hotel is very nice and very clean both inside and out and they have many staff that go over and above and were helpful friendly and lovely to meet, so I would have no issue with recommending booking this hotel.  Management just need to take on the points about Reception, the Pool Bar, Beach Bar and the drink service in the Restaurant, although quite minor overall if these issues were ironed out then it would be an overall excellent rating for this Hotel.",2
62183,"In about the center of the city. The hotel is near the BTS (7-10 mins walk) and there is so many food stalls to see while heading there. The guest is all the best I can find, they are so kind and helpful. I can put my luggage until my flight in the night there so I can go outside and come back just to pick it up.  We were helped by this staff whose name is Nut ",2
58935,"We stayed at the Althea Inn Roof Terrace for one night and wished we had stayed longer!! Our room was lovely and had a small balcony with a table and chairs that overlooked a green area. Also, the shower in the private en suite bathroom was amazing.  Their service was EXCELLENT. They were very responsive, checking to see what time we would arrive and allowing us to check in early.  We were offered cappuccino on arrival. The room is stocked with a small kettle for tea (yay!), a few varieties of tea, and a couple of waters in the fridge as well as some mandarins. Whenever I had a question, I used What’s App to ask and was responded to immediately. Breakfast was delicious, and the staff called a taxi for us on departure.  The staff was extremely attentive.  Our stay could not have been more perfect.  Thank you!!",2
23916,Hotel is located in the prime of CBD center. Few steps away from Doha City Center. And it's facing scenic Doha Sands AL-Corinche.  Hotel's staffs were helpful and attentive. Especial thanks to front office staff - Angelika for assisting for midnight check in.  Overall a satisfied stay. ,2

11780,"This hostel was really nice - clean, nice staff and lovely common area. Beds were nice and private in the dorms. Only thing was that the doors were quite noisy and they also weren’t weighted so that they closed automatically which I didn’t think was very secure since some people in the room would just leave them open.",2
40365,"My girlfriend and I selected a dive package through Sea Bees that included a 5 night stay at their resort.  This place was amazing for the price.  If you are in Phuket to only dive, this is the place to stay.  The staff was extremely pleasant and friendly, the food was wonderful, pool was awesome, and the room had everything you need, including A/C.  Plus, you could arrange anything from the staff, from a Thai massage, to a scooter rental, or a cab ride to somewhere in Phuket.  Note that this is truly a 'dive resort', as it is located in Chalong Bay, within walking distance to the dive shop and pier.  If you want to go to the beach or anywhere within Phuket, you must arrange for either the scooter or a taxi.  Kata beach was only about a 10-15 minute cab ride depending on time of day.",2
49263,Loved the location as we were in walking distance of the LA Ramada Market as well real close to the main cathedral. The room was small as compared to US standards but all emendities were top shelf.  The staff was very professional and offered assistance and recommendations.  Restaurants in easy walking distance.  Room was spotless although my wife preferred a tub.,2
2717,Was expecting a room like any other hotel we have stayed. The bed was a king and left approximately 1’ of space on either side. Bathroom sink was a joke with a shelf hanging over it. Unable to wash your face ,2
20570,I highly recommend this hotel. It's in a very central location with everything you want to see in the city walking distance or a short cab ride. The service was 10/10. They went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed. My room had a great balcony and was much larger than I expected. I would definitely stay here again. ,2
41046,"The hotel is a bit out of the way but definitely worth the metro/Uber ride...  especially because they have a secret weapon: Bernie! This man made our trip to Milan!! His warm personality, attention to detail and recommendations that were tailored to my wife and I went beyond the extra mile. I will stay at this hotel EVERY time I come to Milan! Thanks Bernie!!!!",2
66741,"Booked the hotel for £188 because of convenience to the O2 which was amazing! It has a great Morrison's and super drug behind for any needed essentials.   The problem is the bed is just so uncomfortable, like laying in cardboard. They claim 24 hours service and access to what's app for queries, but Ibis left me on read 🤣.  This isn't a complaint but more something I found funny. Coming in late from a concert we asked if they still had food on, they said yes and gave us a menu. The best value item is wine and cheese board - 17 pound. When we went to order we were told that late night they could on do pizzas and stuff (fair enough just wish they had said when giving us the menu), but it did make me chuckle they could hand make a pizza but not cut up some cheese 🤣.  Overall it's a 3 star experience, which is I think what it's actual rating is. It's convenient, clean but a bit half assed and expensive if staying in on a concert night.",2

I can say that this hotel is an economical choice if you wish pay less. Because it includes a small kitchen, I cooked my meals there. The bathtub was ragged but this was not a problem because I newer use this facility in hotels.  ",2
38289,"Stayed here in April 2023 with family.   The hotel is in a prime location on Bang Tao Beach, in the new and upcoming  Laguna development.   Our reason for choosing the hotel was proximity to Laguna Golf Course, while also having direct access to the beach.   Our room was a larger Laguna Premier Room. It was large with a separated seating area with large couch, where the extra bed for our kid fit easily. There was also a balcony which looked over the lagoon. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The room was absolutely quiet despite being located over the main restaurant used for breakfast. Overall a very nice room.   One of the other reasons for staying here was the wide variety of restaurants. The restaurants are all okay, and I think maybe the one weak spot.  The staff are all really friendly but the food is very generic tasting, even the Thai available via room service and at the main restaurant. The only really good meal was at the specialty Thai restaurant, but even that was a buffet. The included breakfast was a large spread but very average and actually really manic with all the people trying to get a table. Also the main desk didn’t take. Deposit when checking in, so each meal had to be paid for at the moment…sorta weird.   As mentioned before, the hotel is in a lovely location right in Bang Tao Beach, which is a wide sandy strip of sand. There are lots of nice shacks and restaurants on the beach.   Also the Porto Phuket mall is a short drive away and that has some nice restaurants and shops (few in number).   Pool was always really packed and we didn’t spend any time there, as it was hard to get a sun lounger.   Wifi etc worked well.   Overall, it’s a fine establishment and will work for most people. But it’s too generic and big box for us.",2
29856,The hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of Plaka. Central to many tourist spots including a superb view of the acropolis from the roof terrace. The staff were excellent and found us an alternative to a trip to Delphi that was cancelled by Getaways Greece with no notification until I contacted this company to find out why they had not picked us up.  Breakfast was satisfactory.  I would recommend the hotel.,2
22179,"We stayed in a connecting rooms for 4 people. Room size was average but it was clean and comfortable. You can easily walk to Dotonbori or Shinsaibashi from the hotel. Overall a very good hotel for family with children.  On a side note, there was a BBQ restaurant opposite the hotel which was good.",2
32496,"Long review up ahead, so if you like novels, you’re in the right place.  First, I’ll start off by saying I’m pretty picky about my vacations. I work hard and thus have high expectations for when I want to relax. But I also have 3 kids ages 4, 6, 8 so vacationing with them is more about fun and less about doing nothing but lying there.  I picked Wyndham because I could not find one negative thing on Expedia or Trip Advisor reviews, please the Wyndham Alltra facebook group had such raving fans. I still went into the experience not thinking I would be too impressed.  We went May 23-29 2022 with my husband, children and parents (parents flew in from another state). We met by baggage claim and took USA Transfers shuttle for $75 round trip. They were timely and professional in both directions, and it only took about 20 mins or so to get to the airport.  Upon arrival, everyone was all smiles and super helpful. Most of the staff is bilingual and can speak English well, but I still tried to inject some Spanish here and there. Check in took about 30 minutes, maybe even more, and I think that might be due to slower computer systems, but the front desk staff was so calm and patient, that I don’t think anyone really minded.  Initially I had booked the Family Junior Suite, but I didn’t want to share the same space as my kids when we slept, so I upgraded to the Master Suite Ocean View on the sixth floor (room 2652). I’m incredibly glad we did that. The views from the room were phenomenal and the separation of the sleeping space was ideal. 2 of my children slept on the fold out couch and they added a rollaway bed before we had even checked in. The 6th floor also has a VIP Lounge, and I personally liked it because I would dip in for a cocktail or dessert as the day would wind down.  The resort itself is not huge but it is laid out so well. The lobby occupies 2 levels, with one floor being the check in/check out area, and seating couches and the upper part with a huge screen tv that plays top sports (NBA, Tennis, Champions League games) and an oval shaped bar. The childrens four-leaf typed clover pool, and the Pirate ship water slides + water park and kids club and a restaurant are off of that second floor lobby. The first floor lobby has direct access to the pool and buffet restaurant. There’s also a 24 hour coffee shop “starbucks like” with all the pastires (muffins, choco. Croissants, ham & cheese sandwhiches), and coffee concoctions. Again, the staff is wonderful. Quite literally everywhere. And it must be mentioned. THIS PLACE IS SO CLEAN. There are people cleaning constantly. The floors shine and the attitudes shine brighter.  The beach area, is off of the main pool, a few steps down and also has a bar, burger/hot dog station, DJ/music, towel station and cabanas ($67-70 per day) and beach chairs with hut-type umbrellas. I’m a huge beach person, and this is no fault’s of the resort, but there was a ton of seaweed (that they cleaned daily) and the water was rough. I understand this might depend on the time of the year that you go. So naturally I didn’t spend a ton of time at the beach because it wasn’t really swimmable. But still fun to hang there, and take pics by the colorful Cancun sign.  Let’s get to the great stuff. The pool activities. There was always something to do everyday by the main pool. Get a spot after breakfast (don’t need to reserve). The bar rings a bell at 11 am when alcohol is served. The Sports Team staff comes on the mic and starts to explain the schedule for the day. Aqua Zumba, Pool Volleyball, Movie Trivia, Bingo, all pool side. Then they discuss the evening plans. There’s usually a 7 pm children’s show and an 8 pm show suitbale for adults & children. My kids fell in love with the sports team staff (Luis/Luigi, Jesus, Claudia and Lucy). They are so energetic and fun and inviting and charming. I found it quite easy to relax to sit and work on my tan and sip frozen margs/pinas, while watching my kids splash around. I did this every day for 6 days and was perfectly content.   Now food. This is where it’s hit or miss for me. Vacation is not a time to watch your calories, and it was definitely hard to do so here. Ventanas, the name of the buffet restaurant, hits you in the face with like 20 dessert types. I successfully ignored it for the first 3 days and couldn’t resist after.  But they have a ton of options for breakfast, omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, pastries, breakfast breads, Gluten Free bread, fruit, lox, cream cheese, yogurt, smoothies, freshly squeezed green juices and on and on. Lunch and dinner also had creative options, all kinds of shrimp, fish (mostly tilapia), beef, chicken & pork. They also have a kids station with all your standard “orange” food. Mac and Cheese, chicken fingers/nuggets, pizza & fries.  We tried the Italian place, Viaggio once. I wasn’t really a fan. We tried At Sunset, a vegan friendly place, that was pretty decent (only place that served salmon that I saw). Didn’t try the Mexican restaurant or Cravings. Tried Azul once, but honestly between the buffet and bars and hot dog/burger station, you’ll never be hungry. We did book a romantic dinner for 2 on the beach that you have to pay extra for. We picked the surf & turf menu, and it was more food than I could even fathom. Soup. Salad. Main. Dessert. Cocktails. But the view was amazing and service impeccable.   Because I wanted to spend quality time with my kids on the vacation, I didn’t utilize the Kids Club to the full capacity. But they would go every day from 2-4. They are usually open 10-5 and have hourly activities that they post daily. They had face painting, beach soccer, sand castles, water slides, origami, and cookie making. The kids loved it and loved making friends there.  My favorite part was after spending the whole day frying in the sun (it only rained while we slept and the very last day we left), is the 2 hours of recuperating in the room for 2 hours and being freshly showered to prepare for the nightly activities.   The 7 pm kids shows were so creative! One night in the ballroom they had the top Disney song performances (Frozen, Toy Story, Moana, Encanto). Another night a clown/magician. Another night a puppet show. Another night a Pinata party. There was never a dull moment.  The 8 pm shows were even better. Insane acrobatics, fire shows, dance shows. I simply could not ask for better entertainment.   From the moment you wake up, to the moment you sleep there will be a smile on your face. And what more could you ask for.  I was asked if I would ever come back again (by the staff). I asked my also super-picky dad. We all agreed in unison. Abso-effin-lutely. This place gives you all and need and more. The friendliness of the staff, professional nature,   make the entire experience wonderful from end to end. I didn’t want to leave. We’ll be back as soon as I could figure out how I could afford it!",2
18145,"Stayed here for a week in April 2019 and can’t fault the Hotel really. The welcome was friendly and efficient and after an 18  hour journey we were very pleased to be offered an early check-in. The room (Deluxe Double) was much larger than I would normally expect and the facilities in room were great, including electric toilet and flat screen TV as well as a fridge and free bottled water every day. Staff at reception were friendly and although their English wasn’t always great (always better than my Korean though!!) they were always happy to help with any queries we had. Breakfast was taken in the huge restaurant and the range of choices was huge both Western and Asian style (can’t believe some people on here complain about the lack of choice!). The only improvement I would suggest is maybe cooking less of the hot choices (Eggs , bacon etc) more often as we found that these were quite often lukewarm when kept on the hot plates for any length of time. Transport links are fantastic both from the Airport (on the stopping train line direct from Incheon Airport), the Main Station (one stop on the same line) and for getting around Seoul generally (On several Subway lines). The area around the Hotel is not the best area for nightlife or restaurants but they are there if you don’t want to go far a5 night. Hongdae however is only a couple of subway stops away so theirs plenty of choice.  All in all a great weeks stay in a really good Hotel. ",2
50218,"The hotel ,at first impression was not to our liking, our Grand deluxe room seemed devoid of any charm, has nowhere to put your bags, and the view was of a vacant lotted garbage. We looked at two other rooms, thinking we would move, but they were tiny, and no better. We eased into trying to enjoy our stay, and there are good qualities about the hotel. The bed was good, there was hot water, the breakfasts were good, with made to order eggs, hot local dishes that changed daily, lots of good fruit, and cinnamon rolls and sweet treats, good coffee and tea, juice, the whole deal. Staff were all super nice, wi-fi was good, the pool was very nice, but not much room around it to find shade.Check in and out was easy. Great value here for your money, and the location is superb! Just a half block from the busy Jalan Legian, and about a 12 minute , hot walk to Kuta beach. It was also quiet at night. 20,000 IDR for a beer from the restaurant was the cheapest we found anywhere, and ice cold! Only reason for the average rating is the lack of charm in the rooms.",2

61284,"Room - My Riverview Room (22SqM)  was understandably basic and adequately decent but clean (very important!) - no frills and good enough for a short stay cum mattress run even though it reminds me of an Ibis instead.   The room actually felt more spacious than it is, everything in one square of sorts. The King bed is in full view as you enter, flanked by 2 bedside tables with powerpoints and lighting controls available.   Nestled against the window is a daybed offering a ""river view"" where you can stalk the neighborhood from a height - this comes with day and night curtains of course which are both pleasantly quite clean and not dusty at all.   Cosy bathroom with a single sink but generous countertop space, a toilet, and a standing shower space - on rainshower here and toiletries are Active Bodycare branded in pump dispensers.   A welcome note was placed in my room on the first evening, and a small slice of cheesecake on my second, though I found it a bit odd that it was simply placed in the fridge without any note of sorts. I didn't even realize it was there until I wanted to chill something in the fridge - but nice of them still.   Elite Happy Hour - Platinums and above get to enjoy a drink on the house at Best Brew from 6pm-8pm daily - the space is actually quite nice. The policy here is that you get 2x drinks if you are solo, or invite up to 4pax and every of you 5pax gets the 1st drink free.  Breakfast was a decent spread of local (nasi lemak, indian curries, porridge, prata), western options (eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrown), and the cursory stuff (cold cuts, cheese, yoghurt, fruits, breads & pastries). The pot brewed coffee was a little weak but I made it through one cup. The coffee machine makes a much better version.   Basic no-frills   Complete review and pics on Satu Kosong Travel Blog",2

21652,"I do not even know where to start to describe what an amazing and magical experience we had on this boat. I am uploading some pictures that can probably speak better than me.  My husband and I found this place by chance on the internet, we contacted Ludovic for an initial appointment where we were clearly explained everything contained in the wedding packages. Everything was very transparent. I recommend this boat for groups of 40-100 people. We loved the boat and we loved Ludovic so we went for it. He took care of everything and put us in contact with the singer, DJ and flower store, he answered all our (almost daily) questions, he gave us a lot of advices and support and he took into account everything we said we liked (decoration, food, service, schedule of the night). We had a night to test all the menu (and its different possibilities), the wines and champagne as well as to hear the singer while we made a cruise (all included in the package). I have to say  that EVERYBODY loved the food and the drinks: french, british, swiss and  Venezuelans, because we had a very international wedding (which was absolutely not a problem for the organisation). The common feedback from our guests were: the food, wine and champagne was delicious and of high quality.   When we arrived to the boat on the wedding day  everything was perfect! everybody was very kind and attentive, Ludovic actually had to make some late major changes due to problems in the Seine and he made a magnificent job!. The night was perfect! Everything we had plan (including presentations, speeches, games, dancing games) worked out perfectly well and Ludovic was the one who kept the times and schedule because we were too happy and busy to realise the time.  Another important thing: a big proportion of  our guests spent the night in the boat so we could all have breakfast the next day. There is one presidential suite and 2 junior suites. The rooms were very confortable and the breakfast offered a lot of options.   In summary: doing our wedding here was the best decision we could have made. Just keep in mind to book in advance (minimum 6 months)",2

From the people, the food, the markets, the history and the Opera it is a city not to be missed when travelling to Italy. This hotel is super convenient located close to everything.

Excellent pool/jacuzzi for a drink and a chat in the evenings.   The location is also amazing - just 50 metres from the beach and walking distance to town with shops, bars and restaurants galore.   We’ll definitely be back! ",2

Great location, a short walk to the hotel from the subway (Line 4)...about 80 meters. On the doorstep of the Myeong-dong Market...lots of cosmetics...and lots of good restaurants. And only one subway stop...or a healthy walk...to the Namdaemun Market where you'll find tons of clothes, and souvenirs. Very easy to get to from ICN. Can take the subway to Seoul Station and change to Line 4, or take the Limo Bus that drops you off at Myeong-dong subway station, only 80 m from the hotel.",2

34473,"This big international chain hotel with more than 400 rooms is located outside the centre of town next to the Li river. The distance was not a problem, as the taxi ride was only 20 Yuan. The hotel has an extensive garden with a little zoo and a little train for children.  The Horizon Club features its own reception for check-in and check-out, a more intimate breakfast room with river view (but unfortunately also 3 TV screens) and a more than generous happy hour (17:00 – 19:00) with a wide choice of food, including warm dishes and drinks, all for free. Our room had views of the river and the karst hills. Given the shape of the building, river view rooms offer good views of the hills only from room number 27 upwards and best views of the karst hills from room number 51 upwards. The design was a bit old-fashioned for our taste and we would have liked a bit more space and a second easy-chair in our room. We did not rate it five stars, as we experienced some issues with maintenance and service: the shower head was dripping, the sideboard was sticky, in the breakfast room one part of the toaster was not working, once there was no butter and another time no knife for the cheese. Also every night we could hear in our room loud music coming from outside. Thankfully the music stopped always at 21:45 so we could sleep well. Something that gave us a very good impression was the attitude of the management.  One morning at 7:00 some cleaning staff entered our room by mistake. The same day when we were checking out, the manager came and apologised himself and gave us little presents for the inconvenience caused. We were impressed by this because such an incident could have been tossed “under the carpet”. We stayed in a Horizon River View Room for 3 nights.",2
12062,"Although this B&B is out of the main tourist centre and popular backpackers area of Bangkok (Khao San Rd) it is still in a good location for exploring the city either by foot, taxi, Sky train or river boat.  The B&B itself is sandwiched between express ways so is a little noisy but it's a very peaceful relaxing environment inside and has a pool which offers a nice area to relax in out of the Bangkok hustle and humidity.  The staff are helpful and friendly and freshly cook a wonderful breakfast each morning.",2

Hotel is on floors 5 to 11 above a 4 floor shopping mall (pity the mall was only half occupied but has a great, but expensive for Moscow, Italian supermarket "" Eataly""  with many eateries.

56089,"I had to stay in Bahrain for some business meetings and chose the Ibis Seefa hotel, simply, because it was literally next door to the office. Being familiar of some of the Accor group brands, I usually do not go to the Ibis hotels and this review isn’t about the global hospitality experience, nor about the commodities or the quality of the equipment…. No, this review is only about the staff. All of them were very polite and helpful, some went the extra mile to satisfy the customers, among them :  -	Walid at the F&B service (he deserves a raise !). -	The front desk staff (especially the young man who made my check in). -	The maid from housekeeping. Apologies for the people whose name I forgot ! I know all to well what it means to provide such quality service : I used to be a hotel manager for many years….",2
57519,We stayed here for 2 nights to see Milan play football at the San Siro and also to explore the city. It was ideal for both. It is a stone's throw from the stadium! Also a 5/10 minute walk from the nearest tube stadium to get into the city centre. Our room was big and had all we needed (including a safe).  Comfy bed - it's clearly a new hotel so everything is new. Great value for money. It was a really good stay and I'd recommend this hotel. The American restaurant on the ground floor is good too. ,2
35871,"Large rooms. Dated decor but clean. Lombard street is busy and there is plenty traffic noise - any of the reviews here suggesting not are either deaf or fake! WiFi good in room. Free parking a definite plus. No breakfast and no room fridge a minus. Safe area and nice neighbourhood. Not bad price for SF. I found no problem with desk staff on my visit. Short walk to Fort Mason and waterfront, regular buses along Lombard or Union will take you more centrally - if you download the MuniMobile app you can get all day pass for $5 or single trip for $2.5 .

38265,"Architecturally beautiful, beachfront, resort hotel nestled amongst extensive & superbly landscaped 300m pool & gardens, and the Laguna.  Staff were exceptionally gracious and helpful throughout. A special thanks to Ploy & Co. at breakfast, which was very good. Also Mar, our cleaning lady and her crew. And also the fitness crew: Sai, our kayak guide, Redi & especially Tan, a most gifted and attentive Yoga instructor. We would not stay without you! We had our room upgraded on arrival, from a Grand to Premium which was so very graceful and spacious. The day sofa beds were wonderful! The lounge lighting was vey poor however and some switches and power points didn't work. The TV offerings poor. We had to request a clothes hanging rack as there was nowhere to hang wet togs. The vast size of the hotel meant it was popular with large groups, which detracted from the more intimate ambience we prefer. Dining was very expensive but Tom Yam Goong beachside restaurant nearby was brilliant. The beach is lovely though in May it was not clean,  and safe ocean swimming was restricted to locations some walking distance away in either direction. The ferry schedules, every half hour, were not displayed and the shuttle service not regular enough.  I would highly recommend this resort hotel to familes, groups and anyone for short stays requiring the inclusive fitness classes, bicycles and water sports equipment. ",2
44470,"The location is one of the best in the city. You are right on the Mag mile, River north area, and close to the EL and Loop. Hotel offers some fantastic views with floor to ceiling windows.

I'd probably go with a new hotel or a historic one. ",2

I can't say it has a lot of character, but for a 1 night stay it was a good choice.",2
22817,"Our family of four, including my parents stayed here for our second night in Osaka. When we first arrived, there was a long line with two serviceman tried to fix the chandelier.  I have to stood next to the ladder, and felt unsafe. When I tried to ask the receptionist whether she speak English (mind you, I asked her in Japanese), she answered in English that yes she can speak english. The problem is she did not has a good command of English, so after wasting our time, she finally gave up and pointed me to someone else. I later found out that she is a trainer. If this was a small traditional inn then I can understand, but it is a big hotel, so there is really no excuse. This hotel is close to JR Kyobashi station. The room is comfortable enough.

35029,"I recently went to HK for a long weekend. As the IBIS was closest to my friends in mid-levels, I stayed there. I arrived very late at night and just missed the final shuttle bus to the hotel. A taxi from the Airport Express central station got me there in about 10min, and I think it was less than $50HK. Checkin was quick and friendly. I only speak English and had no issues. Connecting to the internet in my room was easy. Shower was awesome, and the bed was better after I asked housekeeping to put a mattress topper on it.  I didn't pay for breakfast, as I found it too expensive compared to what I would normally eat. The Starbucks on the ground floor was fine for my breakfast needs.  Overall, I think this hotel is great value for money (at their current rates in Jan 2020 as compared to other HK hotels).  What DOES need to be attended to though is the ""gym"". It seems to be an old storage space that has been painted and a bunch of equipment squished in there. There are technically 4 areas (1 rower, 1 elliptical, 1 treadmill, 1 small rack of dumbells); however, it started to feel crowded once there were 2 of us in there. I'm used to busy gyms, but this was clearly designed by someone who never uses a gym. If someone was using weights, no one else could as there was no floor space. Trying to get to the door while someone was using the weights meant that you had to go through their space. That same amount of equipment needs to be in an area that is double the size, or take it all away (2/3 of the cardio stuff was out of order anyway) and remove the ""gym"" listing from the webpage. This is a very dense area of town. A city view room means that I can see into other people's flats, and vice versa (even from my hotel room to another room at the IBIS from certain angles). There has been a lot of buildings go up in the last few years. The ""stunning harbour view"" may only be stunning from 1-2 rooms now, and the rest of the rooms have a view by peeking through other buildings towards the water. Something for others to post about, as I did not have pay extra for the Harbour view room.",2
2467,My family of 4 stayed there for 4 nights and we would recommend this place to anyone.  It is within walking distance to most sites in Athens.  We did not have to take the transit at all!  3 minutes from Acropolis Station.  The room was kept clean and the accommodation is well furnished.   Be aware that reception closes at 8 pm so you have to arrange on how to get into your room on the night you check-in.  The arrangement is fairly straight-forward.  We had no issues at all.,2
4197,"We were a bit concerned about staying here after we had read some of the reviews...We arrived at night after an almost 8 hour rail journey. All the hotels restaurants were closed but we managed to have a remarkably good and incredibly inexpensive meal in a restaurant across the street. We had one exceptionally expensive drink in the hotel bar... Staffed by a lovely girl who didn't have clue what she was doing... Still dont think we got the right bill...Our initial room on the 2nd floor was a long way down a dingy corridor and smelled a bit stale . My husband was alarmed by the number of security warnings...The next morning we decided to upgrade to an executive room which also gave us access to the executive club.. Not a huge supplement but What a difference.. It was like staying in a completely different hotel.. !! Housed in the Pacific wing, with a separate beautiful lobby , lovely room, balcony , inclusive mini bar, afternoon tea, all complimentary drinks, and food in club from 6-8pm... Could not fault it at all !!  Also ate twice in the hotels Chinese restaurant which was excellent...and very reasonable. A visit to the Pan Men Garden which borders the hotels is also really worthwhile.. Its lovely . All in all a great stay.. But book executive.. ",2
4358,"Myself and the wife stopped for one night. Its a pleasant clean and cosy hotel, we stopped on the lower floor, en-suite was nice. A very cosy room but thats expected in London.

Not to far of a walk and the pubs and restaurants start. Overall a pleasant stay",2

15132,"Stayed here for one night for the Abba Voyage concert.  On our arrival the lady at the desk was friendly and helpful.  We had room 1, the Queen Elizabeth suite, which was lovely - large room with comfortable bed, good air con, nicely furnished, in the older part of the hotel at the front.  Very near the Abba Arena, just a few minutes on a path that went straight there.    Unfortunately a combination of me being a light sleeper, the busy 4-lane road right outside the hotel, and the single glazing in the room meant that I had a terrible night, so did my other half who isn't such a light sleeper as me.   I had read some reviews warning of this, so I wish we'd stayed in the rear of the hotel where I don't imagine it would be a problem, but the rooms at the front looked nicer.  I would recommend this hotel but if you are a light sleeper please don't be swayed by the fancy rooms at the front, go for one at the back!",2
2939,"Where to start… we originally booked this for 2021 but had to cancel due to Turkey still being on the red list (maybe it was fate) There’s a lot of Russias in your personal space and jumping queues here - to the point there were lots of empty sofas in the main bar and 2 came and sat on the other end of our sofa… why?!  Bedroom - overall was clean and the maid liked to make a swan out of our top sheet which is lovely but also means you have to unravel to make your own bed each night.  Bathroom - door actually came off as the door didn’t fully shut, so my boyfriend tried to pull it across and pulled the door off the hinge, as the bottom of the door is stuck on with tape?! Toilet roll holder could do a 45° turn, plug socket was off the wall, grout was off bathroom tiles/shower, shower generally smelt everyday getting in but not sure if that’s just the water or drain needing a good clean, needed some general maintenance. we did speak to reception on the first day but there was a bit of a language barrier. I requested a room overlooking the pool and we got a beautiful view of the front car park, be it the room was quiet until about 8am when everyone starts banging their doors heading to breakfast. Great black out curtains and comfortable bed.   Food - very average and samey everyday - don’t bother with the a la cart restaurants except the steak (€30 pp), T bone was by far the better cut. Med restaurant (€20 pp) brought your next course out without finishing, so had to leave the food and have to be at the restaurants latest 7.30pm as food closes at 9pm, which isn’t too bad of an issue as the sun is off the pool by 5pm. The food carts outside the buffet were ok, always had a queue outside the dessert van and burgers were good.  Drinks - You need to ask for the real spirits else you’ll only get the local spirits, but we didn’t have an issue when we asked and being British was always polite! Though weirdly, I did find it was a lot easier for my boyfriend to get served by the male staff quicker than I did… again not much of a bother.  Pool - Only 1, so all quite cramped and a lot of small children, biggest pet peeve is people reserving the sunnier beds and only coming out around 3pm (if at all) to sit in them.  Beach - is no where near how big it looks from photos, it’s basically 3 rows of beach loungers then the sea so we didn’t bother going down there.  Staff - Lovely especially Ibrahim, genuinely friendly and welcoming smile everyday for your buffet meals - even drinks English tea himself so made a good cup!  Great rooftop bar with DJ and the quickest serving bar tender we’ve ever seen! Again, friendly bar man but can take a while to get drinks when DJ is on but work really hard.  The entertainment in the evenings - good, piano, sax and violin player in the lobby bar and the Ibiza bar had live performances but you need to be there by 9pm for the 9.30pm showings to get a seat.  Excursion - we did the trip into Antalya which was disappointing, was only £8 each but upon getting there, you’re taken to a jewellery shop for an hour and then into the town itself, which is just a big market full of bad knock off bags and clothing, after 2 hours you’re back on the coach home.   Locally there’s the centre of Kemer 15 min walk away which was nice to look around for a few evenings, no one really bothers you to come in and makes a change to sitting in playing cards.   Overall was an ok stay, wouldn’t class the hotel as a 5* due to maintenance issues in the room and the quality of food, wouldn’t personally recommend to others as I’ve been to a sensatori in fethiye which was superb for the same price but we made the most of it. Who ever did the photography, did a great job!!",2
66916,"My boyfriend and I stayed three nights here. The room was small but comfortable, it had AC so that was a treat. None of the rooms have a private bathroom but it's not a problem as the toilet/shower/sink Are all right outside the rooms and were very clean. It's a little far away from Kaoshan Rd, around a 15 min Tuk Tuk journey but very close to the train station. ",2
53214,"I could go on for ever but will try and keep it simple. Every aspect of this hotel was exceptional! The location, the design, the views it just oozes class and style as well as being kept spotless. The quality of the cuisine in the Bistro and the cocktails in the bar were of the highest standard.  Most importantly the credit needs to go to all the staff it is the staff that made this an incredible birthday weekend for my wife and I, they all offer a level of service that we have never experienced before. They are a team that clearly have an ethos to offer the highest level of hospitality and it doesn't seem forced. They genuinely are lovely, friendly, happy and helpful people. Nothing was too much trouble and they really do make you feel special.  So I guess the only negative for us is that this hotel sets the bar so high that we are certainly going to struggle to find another that can come close to Hotel Clark.  Thank you to all of you for giving us such a special experience and hopefully we will be back again very soon!  ",2
40744,"I recently stayed at the wonderful Villa Maria whilst holidaying through the Greek Islands.  As a travel agent I can comfortably say that this is one of the best properties that I have stayed at. The hospitality of the staff at this boutique resort is unbeatable, during one night where me and my fellow guests decided to stay the wonderful host Dionisia offered up a bottle of her own wine, the following night she even joined us for some Greek wine. Experiences and hospitality like this can't be bought.  Just some general infromation for prospective guests this property is located on the south of the island further away from the main town however upon check in just ask Dionisia to assist you with car hire (it will be brought to the hotel for you all at a reasonable price)  The pool has stunning Caldera views and I assure you won't be disappointed staying here.",2
49147,"Moon Palace The Grand review; 4/5 for daytime but 2/5 for night  Our family traveled to Moon Palace The Grand (MPTG) for spring break with 3 other families. All resorts have their pros and cons, but when traveling with friends we found all-inclusive was the easiest and best choice for us.   We all booked the swim up rooms and requested that our rooms be next to each other. We were all given rooms in the same building, but only 2 families were placed next to each other.  Although this was not ideal, it worked out ok because we could swim down to each other’s patio areas.  Pros:  Our swim up room was fantastic (room 93-159) and allowed our families to have a fun common area to hang out daily. We requested 2 rollaway beds because the actual beds were only full sized, not queen. However, we had plenty of room for the rollaways. All the beds and room amenities were excellent and requested extras came quickly and efficiently.  Room service was good.  We loved our location on the property and it was easy to catch a golf cart if you didn’t want to walk. The pools were amazing and provided a wide variety of options from a relaxing atmosphere to an active party pool. Our favorites were the Cusco and Caribe pools with kids, but we also had a fun afternoon at the adults only pool. The wood fired pizza at Carebeño next to the pool was delicious. We also enjoyed fresh coconut drinks on the beach at 1 pm daily next to the Caribe restaurant. We loved Cusco for breakfast almost daily.  The omelette station was fantastic and we never waited more than 10 minutes to be seated.  Lunch at the Beach Club and Los Tacos was delicious too.  The swim up bars next to Cusco were fun with enjoyable bartenders.  Although we had concerns about the huge number of guests at this hotel, we were pleasantly surprised that everyone was so spread out across the property that it was barely noticeable and seemed more intimate at the pools during the day.   The 8 children, ages 10 to 14, in our group enjoyed the water park and 2 game rooms.  Tapas y Vino was in a good location across from the main game room while we waited for dinner each night.  One night, they had a Spanish Iberico Ham station that was amazing and live music.  We also enjoyed popsicles, desserts and sandwiches from the Boulangerie.  The Pirate Show and dinner was very good.  Cons:  The only time the massive number of patrons were noticeable was in the evening and at dinner. This is where we felt the resort needs to rework its reservation and dining system, as it was very stressful obtaining dinner reservations and waiting in lines. Whether we had our family of 4 or our group of 16 people for dinner, it was stressful and difficult to get seated at a reasonable time.  The concierge would not help us obtain advanced reservations for a large group.  It was also frustrating that their timeshare/elite members could make priority reservations well in advanced unlike us regular folks.  For example, one night we all (16) wanted to go to Habibi for dinner.  Habibi did not offer reservations during our stay, so our only option was to go wait in line early.  We arrived over 30 minutes early with only 1 couple and 1 family of 4 in front of us in line.  Habibi had at least 30-40 tables for 4 people or more.  We got up to the hostess and were told that they were full and to come back at 8:30 to be seated even though almost all tables were empty.  She said all the tables were reserved for the elite members.  We explained we were flexible and would take 4 smaller tables or even 2 tables and divide our party of 16.  After much back and forth, the very unpleasant hostess said she could only seat 8 of us at 2 tables and the rest of us would need to come back at 8:30 pm, a few hours later.  I wish we would have just left, but instead we stayed and, after much frustration, they ended up seating 12 of us at 3 tables.  About 20 minutes later, after an elite member party didn’t show, they finally sat our last group of 4 at a table.  The service was awful, the food mediocre and the belly dancing show embarrassing.  On top of that, our last table seated did not get a choice of food because they were “behind” on the seating, so they just brought them whatever they had ready.    Our other dinner experiences were better but not great.  Our dinner experiences at Jade and Casa Mia were good with excellent servers and good food.  However, we never were actually able to get a reservation for our family of 4 at Casa Mia during our 7-night stay even when attempting to get one the second reservations became available.  Instead, we had put our name in for La Cantina and told to come back for dinner in an hour.  We returned on time and they told us come back in another 30 minutes.  Then, we returned again 30 minutes later and they told us another 30 minutes.  At this point it is almost 10 pm with 2 kids and Casa Mia had many open tables even though La Cantina did not.  They gave us a table at Casa Mia after we complained of the situation and wait time.  Honestly, the hostess should have seen the situation and simply offered us the table at Casa Mia.  Similar situations happened every evening for dinner.  We would have to wait for a table even though tables were open because they were saved for the elite members and seemed to only be released to others if the elite member did not show after 30 minutes past their reservation time.  At The Grill (JC Steakhouse was temporarily in this location), the actual grill was not venting the smoke and the smoke was almost unbearable in the restaurant even though it was a somewhat open-air type pavilion with a full roof and one wall open-air.  We were at the resort during spring break and it is understandable there will be a full house; however, they either need to not book as many rooms or increase their employees given the prices the resort charges.  Just because you have the rooms, doesn’t mean you should book them if you cannot accommodate properly.  Also, they need to be upfront about their dining and reservations.  They need to change their system.  For the prices we paid, we did not enjoy being treated like second-class citizens because we wouldn’t sign up for their elite membership and time-shares.  In addition, a few times we were not picked up by golf carts that were not full because we were told they were for elite members only.  I have enjoyed at least a half dozen other all-inclusive resorts and, from now on, will not go to a resort that sells time-shares/elite memberships and places these members above their other patrons.  Although, we really enjoyed our time at the MPTG during the daytime, the evenings and dinners were stressful trying to have dinner at a reasonable time or getting reservations.  This will cause my family to look elsewhere for an all-inclusive experience.",2
49746,"This stylish property is not a true hotel...it does not have an elevator, lobby, full food service, luggage racks, etc, etc. It is more like a ""design"" pensione.  For us, mature travelers, the lack of elevator was the real killer.  Our huge and beautiful room was on the top floor, 48 steep steps above the reception desk and close to 90 steps from the bottom floor café.  And the hip neighborhood is completely hilly, some passages are steps only.  So for the young and fit, it would be a wonderful choice.  The manager Zeynep is lovely and she understood our predicament.  We were very happy to move elsewhere.",2
4248,"coming for many years, the local style of the hotel, directly neighbour to garden and closely located to city centrecakes it as an attractive location to explore the city. large and comfortable club rooms recommended. Italian restaurant in pan pacific club building part was recently changed into Japanese restaurant, rich international cuisine is available in the main building part.",2
46230,"We chose this hotel as it offered decent rates for Paris and is well-located across the street from Gare de lyon and 15 mins walk to the nearest Batobus stop.  We asked to get the room cleaned again on arrival as there were food crumbs everywhere and obviously hadn’t been vacuumed between stays and lots of hairs on the towels which is unpleasant.  That said its a comfortable place and secure and whilst the restaurant area could be made more inviting (its a bit harsh with white furniture and bright lighting) the restaurant manager Erwan was exceptional.   The service provided by Erwan and team is really elevated above the rest of the hotel. Amazing cocktails and the fantastic service made the place really come alive, with hotel residents spending time there in the evenings.  Worth considering for a short stay in Paris, not the most central but fairly easy to get around from here.",2
10280,"Had a really good dinner at Snaps Sports Bar! Huge serving portion for the food and very accommodating staff (shoutout to  Wil, Yvonne and, Imah for the stellar customer service). Will surely comeback again.",2
34580,"Central location, very friendly and helpful staff. Very comfortable and clean rooms. I could not be happier with my choice as I had to travel to a near by location for work and the staff was extremely helpful in getting me a taxi to the location. One would think this not to be a problem however it is China and I fluently speak English and Spanish but just a few words in Mandarin. ",2
28145,"This hotel is gorgeous . It showed us everyday living with modern art. Throughout the hotel we found art work by different artists, quite impressive display. They upgraded our room to the junior suite as a present for my birthday and wedding anniversary. Staff is very nice and helpful. Breakfast for every taste. As a bonus, very close by is Modec Museum with very interesting permanent exhibition. Taxi to city centre costs 11-12 euros and the reception will call it for you. One minor negative aspect is the choice for dinner which was limited for our taste.  Overall, very nice experience and if it is to return to Milan most likely we will choose the same hotel. Thank you ",2
61440,"It's a small but cozy hotel, very clean, breakfast was plentiful and pretty traditional japanese style with some western dishes available. The staff were so polite, even though some of them did not speak english very much, we still got the basics done without any issues. The hotel was easy to find and the location is good if you like walking around the city, but resting at a quiet neighborhood. The room was clean, but there is a big step into the toilet/shower, so if you have a handicap, it might prove difficult! I would very likely book this hotel again.",2
22842,"Booked two rooms, one triple one twin. Rooms are average size not really big. Stayed there two nights. Easy to locate ,near to the Kyobashi/ keihan station. Near to the OBP( Osaka business park) Walking distance to osaka castle and Sakuranomiya. Beautiful and big breakfast room with nice view . Great breakfast and good service.",2
61729,"We stayed at the Principe di Savoia for 2 nights at the end of a trip around Northern Italy. It is a beautiful, old-world hotel with elegant furnishings. On the positive side - 1) the concierge was helpful in securing dinner reservations for us ahead of time; 2) we were upgraded to a suite; and 3) I loved the Acqua di Parma toiletries in the room. Where the hotel fell short for me is as follows: On our first night we did not receive turndown service. On our second night, we did receive it, but for some reason that the hotel was unable to explain to me, a housekeeper entered our room at 10:20 PM while I was sleeping, and turned all the lights while stating, “Housekeeping!” Absolutely bizarre and unacceptable. We also felt the breakfast buffet was not up to the level of a 5-star hotel. Also of note, but not a problem - the hotel is not in the center of anything, but everywhere we went was within a 20 minute walk.",2
24339,"very nice rooms, especially the ones with a view! good beds, spacey rooms. Breakfast has a good variety of foods but no sanitizer and lots of people - pretty chaotic experience. Could be organized better. Helpful staff, clean rooms. Some noise from the street even though i stayed at 11th floor. ",2

I usually stay for a 3 weeks to a month at a time, there is a kickboxing gym located not far down the road which I go twice a day and returning here for a swim and sleep is perfect. Very convenient location, with a 24 market across the main road, local food market twice a week, few good healthy restaurants. Will need a scooter to head to Nai Harn beach or else the Hotel has its own shuttle which they are always happy to run you down. Grounds and rooms are always kept clean and the staff are always friendly.  Very well run boutique hotel.",2
47676,"Very clean, cosy place with an extremely eye from the owner for every detail. It felt almost like coming home. Close to a station of the BTS, so you can reach every destination in Bangkok easily. Febe the owner, does everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Would definitely look into staying there again for a future trip.",2

58528,"Excellent location, staff very helpful and friendly. Arrived 6AM on checking day and got the room immediately. Priceless after night flight. However, the beds where not good and sleep quality accordingly. They need to be replaced. Air condition was loud and hard to configure.",2
26555,"Location is great, just off Patak Road, so far enough from the party scene to be quiet at night (except for the occasional motorbike going up the hill).  The pool is lovely.  Lots of shade (natural and umbrellas) comfy loungers, quiet and peaceful.  It's a fair hike to the beach, but if you don't have a car or motorbike you aren't doing Phuket justice.  Kata is fine but there are so many better beaches.  Kata Noi, Laem Singh, Nai Harn, Yan Nui, Kamala...  We always rent a car from Thai Rent-A-Car at the airport so we can do a different beach every day.  Staff is LOVELY, breakfast is okay but frankly, slow as hell.  Maybe try calling ahead to place your order?  We waited an hour for a simple breakfast and didn't try again after that.  Rooms are simple, dated, but clean.  Wifi works but it weak on phones, fine on tablets, stronger on the balcony.    No insects, cold AC, bed is okay too, a mid-firm spring mattress.  Fridge and TV and safe, what else do you need?  Go to the beach.  It's a great hotel, truly something special.    The restaurant on the right corner at the bottom of the road is awesome.  Everything we ordered came fast and fresh and delicious.  You can't go wrong.  If you have wheels, also DON'T miss Sabai Corner.  Truly breathtaking view.  Head up to the Kata lookout, and turn on the road immediately to the left of the lookout.  Follow it down a ways and look on the left for the sign, after a funny looking bar on the right.  Beach tips, early bird gets the shade.  Laem Singh has a mini-beach just south of the main beach.  Look for the massage sign.  In front of the far restaurant you can still score (POST ARMY COUP) a very comfy mattress and pillow, and the tree will shade you ALL DAY.  Kamala is the only other beach we saw that has matresses and umbrellas for rent, there's nothing at: Yan Nui, Nai Harn, Kata Noi, Kata, Karon, Patong, Surin.  Surin is a DUMP now.  AVOID.",2
40862,"Room is bigger than other hotels in Singapore but location is fantastic, near to Train and many different restaurants, local shops, Mustafa, little India and bugis.

35677,"We stayed here for 3 nights in early August, 2 adults and 3 kids. The apartments are fantastic. Spotless and modern and very well furnished. 2 double bedrooms and a simple foldout sofa bed. But it’s the location that’s real appeal. Metro stop (red line) right outside the door. But 20 mins walk from Las Rambla, 15 from Gothic Quarter , and your surrounded by nice bars and restaurants. 3 metro stops from Barcelona Sans which is the main station. A nice supermarket is just 2 doors away, and lovely bakery just around the corner. Highly recommend. ",2
5803,"Great location in Ginza, down a quiet street but near all the shopping and 10 mins from train station.  Inside, quiet as a library. Perfect, if that's what you want for sleep. Breakfast decent enough. Friendly staff. Bedroom larger than I expected for Tokyo.  Just wish windows would open for fresh air.",2
7784,"Close to 2 tubes and walking distance to a number of landmarks, the location is great. The room was clean and comfortable - higher quality than many. Only issue was the noise from neighbouring room and our misfortune of having a heavy snorer who was heavy handed on the tv volume next to us. Maybe a volume limiter on the tv would help.Would stay again.",2
60282,We spent 6 days and five nights here at BarcelonaBB and it was truly a home away from home. We booked the wooden room which was quite large with a king size bed.  As this was the second part of our trip--it was a welcome change from the tiny beds in London.   The owner is very nice and took time to answer any of our questions that we had when we arrived.  She didn't stay at the location as she hosts multiple properties but she was an email away.   The breakfast in the morning is nice where you can get a continental breakfast with the option of having eggs cooked to order.  The location is really amazing for the price that you pay.  You are a block away from the metro and approximately 10 minutes from Sagrada Familia.    The only minor issue we had was the language barrier at times since not everyone spoke fluent English.  This wasn't that big of a deal as we were able to get by.   Considering the high prices for hotels especially in August this was truly great value.  We would definitely stay here again.   ,2
12128,"Opted for a further staycation destination during the holiday to avoid the crowd at popular hotels. The hotel targets crew members and layover travelers who seek less entertainment and amenities. While pool is available there, it is rather small and the jacuzzi is not opened (located in changing room). Was arranged a deluxe bay view suite to overlook the Macau Zhuhai bridge. The view was not bad, not breathtaking. The living room is spacious and they got a huge tv compared to other Marriotts. Washroom and bedroom are rather small considering it’s a suite. The deluxe suite is located at the far end of the hallway so you have to walk a long way to your room. They serve afternoon tea and snacks at the executive lounge which was relocated at the lobby. However, I found a piece of wooden stick in my fried noodles which shocked me a bit, not really what I expect at a Cat5 Marriott property. Overall experience is fine, if you wish to have an escape from the city and crowded places during holidays. ",2
18593,"My girlfriends and I stayed here for a vacation in Tokyo.  The location is superb because when you shop for a lot of things around Ginza, you can just walk back to Solaria to drop off your shopping bags then shop again.  The subway exit nearest to it is the Matsuya Ginza exit.  Rooms are clean and their toilets have very helpful amenities and beauty products for women.",2
62477,"We stayed here for 3 nights and yes we did queue for check In and room wasn’t ready so we went off to explore.  When we had our room it was on floor 31 with a good city view and spacious although stayed in better.  It was a pain to go to the rooftop pool as you need to take one lift then change and get another but do get there eventually. Now the infinity pool is the Gem for this hotel as perched on the 57th floor and although busy we always managed to find a sun bed.  The views from this area are great.  We ate at the pool and it’s quite expensive but then what would you expect at one of the most iconic hotels on the planet.   We also had breakfast in Spargo’s every day and this is situated by the pool, it was always very busy and slow service but good choice of food and freshly cooked breakfast if required.  The hotel is well situated as joined the the Gardens and a Hrt station which will take you all over the city.  Would we stay again.  Yes of course",2

45433,"Average means ok, not bad, but not a four or five dots! As expected excellent service, even for only an English speaker.  However for us the service had gaps, which perhaps were due to the high standards we expected of a Ritz-Carlton, so may be unfair.  Examples include having to ask several times for two English breakfast teas with breakfast, ending up with one cup and another of milk.  No leaves in the in the pot either! Also no choice of tonic with my gin. Yes, sorry high standards! The deco also has an odd vibe, its new but feels fake and forced.  All the wood makes it dark and poky. Nice large room and firm bed, and excellent service.",2
34224,"We has such great memories from our previous stays at Fairmont and we chose to come back for our anniversary celebration. And once again, Fairmont Nanjing gave us the most extraordinary experience and exceeded our expectations. The jolly two girls were right besides our door for turn down service as we were walking out for dinner. Nicely done. I have to give it to the Housekeeping team, they were so very efficient, the second day we came back from breakfast, our room were already nice and tidy. Staff at the 60th floor lounge were most helpful. We enjoyed the food and drinks very much. Ivan in the afternoon was so kind and introduced the new town and surrounding buildings in the area, the view from the lounge looking down is absolutely amazing. The lounge manager Kim made sure we have everything we need and was helped us with early departure arrangement one day before, that was so considerate. The girl (sorry I did not catch her name) in the early morning for our checkout at the lounge was most efficient and we really appreciate the fast checkout as we were catching our early train. We had a chance to grab a drink at 61st floor first night we arrived, the bar manager and bartender were very kind to make arrangements for my fiance as he does not drink alcohol while I do :） Excellent band by the way. Here comes the best part, as usual, our favorite restaurant: Vancouver Grill, Chef Emma never disappointed us, her recommendations were simply perfect and exactly what we love. She even remembers us preferences, the steak was juicy and tender, just melt in my mouth. My fiance said he dream that one day he could cook such marvelous steak but that would be just a dream:) And thank you to the restaurant staff for making the special table arrangement for our anniversary, it was very lovely.",2
61379,"Jun2018. This is a newly built hotel. The hotel is up on a small hill so when walking along the driveway from the hotel to the main road, you will be walking slightly downhill and when walking from the main road to the hotel, you will be walking slightly uphill. The hotel is directly opposite the road from the [International Trade Shopping Plaza] where there is a Carrefour supermarket. That mall has many restaurants and there is even a dessert shop on the ground floor selling durian flavoured desserts. The shop is called Balik Pulau (after a famous durian growing area in Penang, Malaysia). This hotel has an executive lounge where there is finger food served in the evenings and also drinks. When taking the glass lifts up the hotel, the view in the daytime is fantastic. The view includes the sea and also the clamshell buildings. The restaurants at the hotel provide good food with good service. Breakfast spread is OK (not fantastic). The Chinese restaurant here (Man Ho restaurant) serves reasonably priced Peking Duck. Bedroom, bathroom, toilet, air-conditioning, all were good and comfortable. Taxi from this hotel to the famous Gongbei underground shopping area is about CNY25 (daytime fare. latenight fare is more expensive). FrancisTLim.",2

30883,I stayed at the Four Seasons because the description claimed to be connected to the Convention Center via a walkway. This was not the case as you had to go to the mall across the street then find the sky bridge.  The hotel itself was very impressive. The lobby is a nice marble and there was a pianist performing when I arrived. The room-service and breakfast buffet were average at best and considerably more expensive than I am accustomed to.  The room was very spacious with an office space and bed. My biggest complaint was the small windows. I felt like I was sleeping in a basement.,2
9925,"I should have given a much higher review score but I was dismayed by the way they handled my concern with the destination fee. They charge you a 25$ destination fee per day but will give an equivalent 25$ dining credit. Make sure to use the voucher to make the most of your room.  The problem arise when we were supposed to use the dining voucher in one of the restaurant which was supposed to close at 10pm but didn’t honor the dining voucher when we are about to claim it 30 mins before their closing time. The reception staff argued that I have all the time in the morning until the evening to use it. The hotel has a problem when they didn’t get our order even if it still 30 mins before they close. When you says 4pm-10pm, stick with the opening hours.   Location is excellent. Room is nicely decorated. Good bed. Clean bathroom.",2
29266,"First time visiting Japan, and Enaka was 1 of 5 hotels I stayed in during my visit. I have to say it was my favorite. It felt very family oriented, the employees were very kind and helpful. It's located close to train stations and there's a really cool market a 2 minute walk away that really thrives on the weekends. The whole environment of the area just feels so unique.  The beds and pillows are comfy enough, the bathroom and showers are clean. Unlike other capsules I stayed in, your locker is located in your bed and your luggage gets locked up at the foot of your bed. Which I liked alot, other places have them in a separate room which is just inconvenient. One thing that really sets Enaka apart from other capsules is that you don't have to check out if you're a staying multiple days. Other hotels make you leave at 10am and you can't come back for several hours. Which creates a shower rush in the morning and lots of noise. At Enaka you're free to come and go as you like. The common room is also really awesome. Its a great spot to meet people and hang out at. They have beer and mixed drinks for sale at cheap prices too. You'll love staying here if you want the capsule experience. 10/10!",2

I commend the friendliness of Sophia Gonzalez ,who is an attendant at the Buffet (she still remembered us). It is still like being in paradise. The Italian restaurant  has changed: The food no longer is as tasteful. There are some limitations, most disappointing are prices at the spa.(double the cost of the US). I use to book 3 during my stay-not this time. I never had contact or the special treatment of my butlers, Irving and Joel.I will continue to enjoy Hyatt Ziva in the future. Would enjoy having relaxing time in the spa at more reasonable rates.",2
65689,"Our experience with Baylosuites was so brilliant, starting with the extremely warm welcome we got from our hostess Zeynep. She went out of her way to make sure we were 100% comfortable and well informed about restaurants, Bosphorous boat trips and ready with any recommendation about Istanbul. It was really personal service at its very best!  The flat was extremely clean, comfortable and larger than the photos suggested - More than enough for a family of three. The decor was stylish and oozing with cool, from the real wood parquet floors to the ultra modern and fully equipped kitchen, coffee machine, microwave and all. Shower was luxurious with an oversize head (better than 5 star hotels)!  The terrace is the best! Great for breakfast and available to all guests with garden chairs, parasol, music console (I want one!) to play those chill-out tunes while sipping those sundowners or Turkish Tea at sunset, Coffee maker, Ice maker and the most amazing views of the Golden Horn and the Historic Peninsula...What more could you ask for? A fire place? Yes, there is one here also for those cozy and slightly fresher winter days. Need simid for breakfast....Fresh simid is there in the mornings waiting for you!!!! What more can I say!  The location was also super. Bang in the middle of the action, with the trendy restaurants of Galata just a few hundred metres away and the essential Istiqlal street just a 5-10 minute walk away. The Historic Peninsula was easily accessible by tram (best way), with the tram stop (Karakoy) just a 5-10 mins walk down the hill. Taxis are also available from Karakoy and the surrounding streets.  The only issue was ""that hill""...Getting back from the Karakoy (the tram stop) is a little bit uphill. But reaching the flat after a long hard day sightseeing is more than worth. However, parents with baby strollers may find it gives them a workout!  In short, you have to stay here when visiting Istanbul, whether business or pleasure!!....I wanted to extend my holiday indefinitely! Looking forward to when we can come back....Thanks Zeynep and team!",2
45823,"From start to finish this was one of the best holidays we have been on. Yota was a fantastic host and she was extremely knowledgable about Santorini, throughout the week she sorted table reservations, quad bikes and more.  We stayed in the Nykteri villa on the ground floor and it was immaculate, minimalist design but very traditional Greek with blue and white all over, waking up to breakfast was amazing with vegetables grown locally and lovely fresh bread. And then taking a dip in the pool with the sun beaming down on us meant the most relaxing start to each day of our holiday.  Already planning our return to Santorini and to Vino Houses!   Thank you Yota for an amazing holiday !!  Tom + Lois",2
15032,"Great clean hotel and walking distance to a wonderful seafood restaurant, Freda's. Spacious rooms with a hot tub that is clean and actually was hot. (In the past we've found that hotels in the winter turn off the hot tub.) The price for New Years night was great, will be back next year.",2
6634,"Three day retreat, from my fulltime carer role, was recommended the Cambridge by a friend who lives nearby. Thrilled with the accommodation & the closeness of the motel to bars, restaurants & the city.",2
67443,"Stayed here for three nights. We chose it for the location and price. It was really hard to beat. I'll start with the positives. Clean room and our shared bathroom was V clean. Rooms got cleaned daily. Breakfast was pretty good for a continental in a hostel. Staff were pleasant. Location is superb. The Gothic quarter is somewhere that is perfect for tourists. As central as can be. Some nice bars and cafes nearby alongside cheap supermarkets.   Ok now for the cons. Obviously when paying a low price there will be trade offs. Walls were thin. Thin enough that we could hear the people in the room next door whispering. Not an exaggeration. I'm a heavy sleeper though so it didn't bother me too much.   Security was a major turn off. Had I realised before how security worked there I would not have went for it. So you get a key for your room. You have to give the key into reception when leaving the hostel and ask for it back when returning. Seems like a very insecure method as there was no verification required for collecting a key. We were also handed the key to the room beside us on one occasion. There were no safes in our room to add to this so we really did not feel like our things were secure in our room. If you want to use a locker it is €2.   I probably wouldn't book again mainly due to my thoughts on their security. Also they have emailed me that they are having a competition for leaving review. The prize is a mini iPad. To quote the email ""But remember… participate will be possible as long as the person has stayed here and can appreciate her o his experience publicly."" Incentivised reviews are often misleading.   I'd recommend this place if your on a budget but don't leave your valuables in your room. ",2
61135,"The hotel is centrally located & walking distance to the Acropolis, the Museum & the Plaka area. We had a view of the Acropolis from our balcony, could see the sunset the other direction & a park across the street so it was quiet. Everyone was very nice & they have a very good breakfast everyday. You can go to the rooftop with a drink to see the sunset",2
23195,"We have stayed here twice, and both times, we chose this hotel because of its proximity to the American Girl Place and because of the American Girl package.  We went for the first time in 2021 during Covid restrictions, so it was of course very clean then, although certain amenities, such as the pool, were not open, and Chicago itself was a ghost town! We went back again this year because of our great first experience, and we will certainly stay again.  We first chose this hotel because it is very close to the American Girl Place, it has a pool, and the prices are reasonable, while still being a nice hotel in a great location.   The people are all very helpful and friendly. The young man at the front desk, Ryan, was especially helpful. He was so professional, patient, and helpful. We stayed two nights, and he both checked us in and checked us out, and helped with any questions we had. The hotel itself felt very welcoming because of him. He always remembered us and asked about our Chicago adventures, etc.   Our suite was very clean. There are some things that might need updating, but it was very clean and very comfortable. Shower was hot, views of the city were amazing, bed was very comfortable.   We also enjoyed the pool. The views from the pool on the 30th floor at night were very neat, and the room as well as the water were very comfortable temperatures.   We had the American Girl package, which includes a doll bed, book, cookies and milk, and tickets to 360 Chicago, which is right next door and gives you views of the city from the 94th floor. That was something I wouldn't have thought to otherwise do, but it was a very cool experience.   We didn't check out the restaurant because sushi is not our thing, but there are plenty of places within short walking distance, and plenty of places that deliver, so dining was never an issue for us. The small market in the lobby had drinks, coffee, pastries, snacks, etc, for those who need it. Although, same with the dining, the hotel is in such a prime location, that you can easily walk anywhere. We stayed there Feb 5-7, and even the winter walk was not a problem.   Parking is expensive, but not by Chicago standards. You'll pay as much or more at any other hotel. We spent the extra money for the valet parking for the convenience, and I would also do that again. The valet drivers were very quick and professional.   I would recommend this hotel, and we would stay here again!",2
34521,"The good: Great hotel in a decent location just on the edge of Zone 2 underground. About a 20-30 min trip on the tube. Nearest tube station about a 5 mins walk from the hotel. Rooms were clean and tidy and well decorated, only hand soap provided in bathroom with towels, nothing else although there was a note saying toiletries could be requested. Tea/coffee, iron, hairdryer etc all provided. We checked in very late due to train delays and a night out and this was perfect for us.   The not so good: When we got to our room on 6th floor, we noticed that our room was very very hot when we entered it (26c on room thermometer). We turned the air conditioning down to 18c and went to bed. The room was unbearably hot through the night and the temperature did not drop below 25.5c, despite even setting it to 10c!! We had to sleep on top of the covers, not able to open a window. When we went to breakfast the sun was shining on the big glass windows near the lifts and it felt scorching hot (tropical!!) - can see why the rooms get so hot. It wasn't even a hot day outside (just sunny). We did mention it on checkout and the receptionist advised that there was an issue with the air con at that time and advised we could have requested a fan. Unfortunately, we did not realise the aircon was not working until after we had gone to bed and found the room did not cool down. I have seen that this has been mentioned in previous reviews so clearly not just a one off.  All in all, a good hotel, in a decent location - just too hot for sleeping well for us that night.",2
26134,"We spent a long weekend in Istanbul because we attended a friends wedding. So we looked for something not too expensive and from where we could do some sightseeing. Cube Suites were perfect for that and I liked that it was very clean and also smelled fresh. As some people remarked, it has a more simple and straightforward style. But I really like that pure modernism. All furniture are made by the owner and I think that is really cool.",2
43425,"I spent two nights at this lovely bed and breakfast. While I think I spent enough time to really explore Bangkok, I wish I could have stayed one or two more nights just because the stay at this hotel was so wonderful! I actually did not stay 2 consecutive nights here; the nights were separated by a 3-day trip to Kanchanaburi. However, I asked the hotel if I was able to leave my large suitcase there since I was returning in 3 days, and without hesitation, they said I could. I offered to pay them a bit for the inconvenience, but they refused to take my money.   The example I described above is just one of many examples of how wonderful and helpful the staff at this hotel is. They were great with helping me to arrange tours, calling taxis/Uber rides to help me get around town, and anticipating my needs. Noon, who is the owner, is wonderful also. She gave me a very detailed map of Chatuchak Market when I went so that I could be sure to never be lost.  The rooms themselves were incredibly spacious and clean. They had a very sleek, modern look, and you have to love that they shape the towels into elephants and put them on your bed. The beds were also very comfortable.   The only downside that I see in staying here is that it is a bit out of the way in that it is not in the center of downtown but more on the outskirts. However, I like that it's not right in the hustle and bustle of the city, and personally, when I travel, I enjoy being in an area with more locals. This definitely fit the bill. While the BTS station is not too far away, I never got the hang of finding the most efficient route to and from the station. This is likely because I didn't spend enough time staying in the area. Overall, I had a wonderful experience, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",2
629,"I had a great check in at the HI Singapore and was kindly upgraded to a corner room. However the room is pretty dated and drab, and overall the hotel feels in need of renovation. The lobby, floors and rooms  have a 90s hotel vibe. Checkout was very slow with only one person at the desk who was doing his best to deal with a queue of 4 - 5 waiting check-in / check-outs, and it took about 20 minutes.",2
62524,"We’d read the reviews and pre booked a table. When we arrived we were told we could sit anywhere, booking seemingly hadn’t been necessary. There is a dedicated dining area but aside from one family eating, everyone else was in groups just drinking and in the case of one particular group being unnecessarily loud. The food is well priced, with the menu being more extensive and interesting than the sample one online, so we were pleasantly surprised. We had a sharing Camembert to start, then mains of steak and mussels. All of it was very good. There seems to be a skeleton staff, as Tom, who was mainly behind the bar, appeared to be responsible for everything bar cooking. He didn’t stop all evening, but still had time to give a warm greeting and make you feel welcome. All in all a good evening, we were impressed with the food, will return and bring the family along next time. ",2
59186,"Arrived late and left early, so not the most comprehensive review. Room was comfortable. Fantastic quality bathroom products...the body lotion is great! Had the look and feel of a UK Malmaison place. Found a couple of USB points! Breakfast was on the roof top restaurant. It was pretty simple, but good. Nice fruits, yogurt, bread and of course great coffee, but not your bacon and eggs set up.  Reception staff were really nice too. Just what I needed after a long tiring trip.",2
4155,"Service here is amazing.  To be specific, all the support staffs are welcoming. Vicky raj, who helped me with my luggage, is so humble.  The security rules with regard to the outside packages(mainly food packages) can be more flexible. Bellboy isn't delivering the outside parcels to the room. It's hard  to get down each time to pick up my parcel from the lobby. ",2
67268,service in the lounge as been awesome. I have been coming here for more than two years and have always been treated very well. Winnie and Kelly and Alay were my go to hosts. they anticipated my needz and remember what i like for breakfast. We have options to choose ourhotel in Suzhou and i always choose the Shang.,2
6547,"A memorable stay at this delightful BnB / Hotel. Wonderfully located its staff are well trained. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms modern and clean and the breakfast sumptuous. Throw in warm hospitality, the convenience of the hotel car to take you to the airport, and its proximity to everything there is to do and see in Prague then you'd be crazy to stay anywhere else.",2
61458,"Had a chance to visit Osaka for a week and my wife and I stayed here in Hotel WBF Kitasemba West.  The room was small but complete.  The location is very convenient and near to every stations, groceries and stores, malls and restaurants. Service crews are friendly and very helpful.  When we visit Osaka again, we’ll definitely stay here again.",2
39020,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom deluxe apartment with our 2 young kids. The hall had a sofa bed as well. The apartment had everything you would need! Hotel, rooms and pool are very clean and well maintained! We barely saw the staff around. For the public holiday we were told before hand that there would be no housekeeping. Breakfast finishes off at 9.30 every morning. So for late risers like us, we missed it every day!  Just a tip: A 2-bedroom deluxe apartment has 2 rooms with a living room, a kitchenette and dining table. Whereas a 2-bedroom super deluxe was basically 2 x 1-bedrooms interconnected! Which meant 2 tiny dining tables and 2 kitchenette. So for a more cozy and family feeling, the deluxe is a better option.",2
47343,"We are a family of 4 with teenage kids and stayed for 3 nights at a 2-br 2-bath apartment.  The apartment is very clean albeit very basic. You need to bring your own toiletries though. Shower stall is a bit small.  Location is 10 minutes walk to Coloseum, 40 minutes walk to Trevi fountain, 10 minutes to metro lines for Vatican or anywhere else, and right in front are bus stops for bus #85 to Trevi Fountain area,  #87 right in front that goes to Campo de Fiori and tram #3 for Portese Flea market(SUndays only - hundreds of stalls)  Andrea was very helpful and flexible. We were just getting off our cruise very early in the morning and wanted to check in by 10:30am ( a few hours ahead of normal checkin time)  in order to settle in and be able to make the 1pm Underground tour at the Coloseum (high recommended by the way). Andrea accommodated us and our plans went well.  Andrea provides probably the best map to use to navigate Rome. It includes various suggestions of places to eat and visit. Best advice he gave was to avoid places to eat in front of the tourist sites. Along Via Merulana, 10 minutes from the apartment, are a large selection of wonderful places (restaurants, gelatarias and pastry cafes) that costs 30-40% less than those near the Coloseum.  I also want to highlight his small mention of a place called Eataly. It takes a short metro ride on Blue line to get there but if you are a foodie, it is worth a visit. It is like a huge supermarket with 3 floors of only high quality products made in Italy (kind of like Whole Foods in the US) and also a variety of restaurants within it. We bought a wonderful whole roast chicken for lunch back in the apartment for 4 of us for 6.50 euros.  The only suggestion for Andrea I would make is if he could upgrade to the TVs. It would have been nice to be able to start or end the day with news from BBC, CNN or CNBC for us news junkies. But I'd give a 5-star rating nevertheless for the value.  Wifi worked well - according to my son who watch You tube videos instead of TV.",2
10403,"In general, the receptionists, service, room amenity and lobby design are totally awesome. A space filled with art atmosphere is appealing to patrons. There are some personal advice for the host, one is the ventilation system of the bathroom is needed to improve; second, the breakfast is not worth for the rate, to my disappointment, it was under my expectation.",2
39839,"Just 2 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station exit 3. Many restaurants & convenient shops close by.  The only thing I don't like is the bathroom and toilet doors. Both are glass doors, it is only the middle part is frosted glass. If go with normal friend is not feeling comfort.",2
48643,"Great little hotel!  Absolutely perfect location and tucked up a side street 3 mins walk from the Louvre.  The staff are extremely helpful, pleasant  and welcoming.  They will also keep your bags locked away after check out, so that you can enjoy any time you have left in Paris  sans baggage.  Also helpful in arranging taxis.  Yes rooms are small, but very clean, serviced every day and have everything one needs.",2
6737,Rather small room but good if you are on a short visit. Good place to stay if you are visiting Little India. There are a number of MRT stations nearby so it is easy to get around and see Chinatown or Marina bay. Coffee and tea provided as well. Staff were helpful - especially Faizal,2
8497,"Rooms are a decent size by Tokyo standards (which is renowned for having small rooms). Free Disney Shuttle is a good bonus. There is a small shopping area located under, but, not part of, the hotel which has a supermarket, some places to eat, a pharmacy/minimart, Hungry Jacks & Subway, which is handy. Staff go out of the way to assist and there was always at least one person on duty that spoke English and could help us with things. Only concerns we had during the trip were a couple of nights when we had some really loud people partying in surrounding rooms which impacted on our sleep, but, can't really blame the hotel for other guests selfish behaviour. Hotel is now non-smoking, but, as a non-smoker, I could still smell remnants of when it used to be smoking, but, this is something you are going to encounter in most Japanese hotels - certainly wasn't overpowering and didn't affect our stay - you can tell a real effort is made to continually ventilate the property to get rid of remnant smells. One thing that is an area for improvement - the free shuttle to the subway only runs in the morning. Given that check in is 2 or 3pm, this is not helpful in transporting bags between the station and hotel, nor does it help at the end of a long tiring day when you are faced with that 800m walk. Yes, it's only 10 minutes or so, but, that can be a long way with bags and/or if you are tired. Would like to see the shuttle run all through the day. Other than that, quite happy with our stay at this hotel.",2
43034,Stayed here while attending an exhibition.  The central location made getting around easy and everything needed was within walking distance including metro stations.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable.  Restaurants and cafes were expensive but there were great options at the neighbouring shopping centres.  Though the Starbucks in the lobby was handy in the morning.,2
10531,"We found the hotel location was its best attribute.  So close to downtown and Soldier Field where we were taking in a Bears game.  We had cleanliness issues with a couple of the rooms and requested room changes twice.  The majority of the staff was friendly and responsive to our requests.  Support staff was also responsive and attentive.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  The rooms need repairs to the walls and doors and the windows and frames need replacing, at least in all of the three rooms we were in.  This could be a great property if BW decides to put some money into repairs and replacement of doors and windows. ",2
13786,"Our second visit to Amari Pattaya. We do really love this place because of the location that's really close to Terminal 21, beach just crossing the road and scenic view of Pattaya Bay.  Room is spacious with small balcony. Just for a bathtub that's behind the bed which if you're travelling as friend may feel uncomfortable.  Restaurant has plenty of choice but too crowded at some moment.  Water park is really fun for children and a view of the sea is very lovely.  Big thanks to K. Tom and Minnie at Kids club that recognise our daughter and take  really good care of her.  Hopefully that we'll meet again next year ",2
44132,"Lovely hotel on the river, best we have found in Bangkok, a peaceful retreat from the chaos of the city. Amazing daily kids club, Jasmine was an absolute star with our 4 your old daughter, we couldn’t keep our daughter out of there. A fully packed schedule of art, crafts and adventures.   There is a very good on site spa open until 10pm which is perfect for tired mums (at hotel, not Thai, spar prices, 2500-6000bht per treatment).   We had two joining rooms which was ideal for a family of 4. The ‘twin’ setup beds were super singles, so lots of space for adult of child (for when Dad gets carried away at the bar). Both had balconies with smoking allowed.  Happy hour 4-6pm at the swim up bar was nice. 200 baht draft Chang pints (vs 280 normally).   Loads of events, music etc on at the various on site venues but definitely a calmer more luxurious vibe vs a party one.  The buffet at Trader Vics was one of the best we’ve ever had, amazing selection of seafood, sushi, Mexican, bbq, tapenaki etc etc. (9000 baht for a family for 4 with 1 free flow)  They have a private boat shuttle every 30 mins down to Sathorn Pier (BTS) which makes getting into town easy (Jacks bar, 5 mins walk from the drop off is worth a visit for well priced food and beer on the river).",2
12627,The location of this hotel is ideal close to both Moscow city and the areoexpress train. The breakfast was good plenty of choice from cereal to salad's and everything in between all from a self-service buffet. The rooms are adequate but no tea or coffee facility or complimentary toiletries which I find unusual for a hotel in this price group.,2
26801,"I had such a great experience at Thavorn. I highly recommend it. They have a Beach zoo, and the food was incredible. Jum was an excellent hostess, and I never felt like I was a solo traveler. If you come to Phuket, you have to stay at Thavorn.",2
63118,We stayed at the property for two days ( June 5th and 6th).  I would like to write a few words about the 24X7 restaurant at the hotel. The food quality and service was fantastic. The Manager went out of his way to fulfill our request for special food needs. Thanks to the team for helping us during our short stay. ,2
5393,"I first stayed at this hotel back in 2019. My wife and I fell in love with it. We liked the security, the breakfast and room. Sadly things weren’t the same on this trip. The security was the same. The customer service was the same as well. But here are a few issues.  #1. My room would never get cold. Those rooms are priced in a manner where you expect your room to stay cold. The first time I came that wasn’t an issue.  #2 The breakfast didn’t offer the same variety and quality of foods like they offered back in 2019.  #3 Do not get your laundry done there. If you have a family like mine it will cost you. My bill was almost $300. They charge more than my local dry cleaners in the US. That didn’t make a bit of sense at all. I will say they done a great job with the cleaning and folding of clothes. But it’s not worth the money to use this service.  #4 The hotel should do a better job at keeping women out the bar area who trade extracurricular activities for Kenyan Shillings. That makes the place look real cheap.",2
961,"Hostel is easy to reach, not far from acropolis. It has a roof bar to meet other travelers from all over the world. Not far away they have a sports bar with karaoke or to watch football etc.. Small breakfast is included. IMO the staff was nice and helpfull.",2
31984,"Near the Milano Centrale train station, this hotel is very nice.  Friendly staff. Very easily access less than 5 minutes walk from the train station. The spacious room makes you like home. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were very clean. TV, internet, minifridge, desk, everything was perfect.  I did not have breakfast, so I can't tell the quality of the food.  But I would recommend this hotel for sure.",2
24405,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was amazing and the rooms were lovely. Staff were so helpful and couldn’t do enough for us. There’s only 1 restaurant near the hotel which was lovely and would highly recommend (L’immagine Bistrot). The number 57 bus is across the road from the hotel that takes you pretty much into the centre. As the hotel is far away from the main centre we also took the train which is a few minutes walk from the hotel. Abit disappointing to see the hotel doesn’t have a bar, especially after walking around Milan all day. The bed was very big and comfy, as was the bath. Massive TV on the wall but unfortunately no English channels. I would highly recommend staying in this hotel. ",2
65484,"This is a fairly new hotel located about a 10-minute walk from the Shibuya train station.  The room was the smallest we encountered in Japan, but it was clean and functional, and we made it work.  The hotel staff were reasonably helpful, but for some reason they were very aggressive about collecting breakfast tickets.  And, unfortunately, there is only limited seating in the breakfast area, which meant that many guests had to eat in the rather dull conference room adjoining the breakfast area.  The food itself, however, was good. For me, one of the best points about this hotel is the onsen, which is a great place to relax for a few minutes at the end of a day of sightseeing.",2
52515,"I've stayed at this property multiple times before 2020, and I wondered how it would fair after the pandemic.  I'm glad to report it is better than ever.  The first thing that strikes me is the high quality of the staff.  The service is first class, without being obsequious.  The lobby staff greeted me as always at the taxi, took care of my luggage, and directed me to the front desk. (They now how a new sign that directs Club room checkins to notify staff, and when I did, they whisked me upstairs to the club floor for a club checkin).  The checkin went quickly, and although my room wasn't ready, I was invited to wait (about 30 minutes) in the club room and have a refreshment.  I was upgraded to a club suite, and the room was spacious with kitchenette area, dining table for four, couch, and a huge desk. I opted for the lower cost mountain view, which is still lovely--the Tolo harbour view is spectacular, but visible from the club room.  The club serves a very hearty breakfast and happy  hour in the evenings--if you only want a light dinner, this is more than enough.  One amazing improvement is to the MTR line (East Railway) that is about a five minute walk.  Two new MRT stations have open that now connect this line to Hong Kong island, ending in Admiralty.  So this hotel is a VERY easy one-train ride from central Hong Kong, about 30 minutes or so on one of the cleanest public transportation systems I have been on in the world.   If staying in New Territories is something that you are open to, I recommend this hotel highly, and the cost is at least half what you would pay at a comparable hotel on Hong Kong Island or TST.   ",2
10160,"Our room was enormous, very comfortable. Tram is right outside that will take you to old town or Prague Castle.  I didn't like the breakfast being in the bar, after a long night the night before I didn't want to return to the scene of the crime so soon. Would absolutely come back.",2

12117,"As we have Titanium and Platinum Bonvoy membership, my good friend and myself chose to stay in Skycity for our birthday celebration in July. I have asked some simple questions before our arrival, such as shuttle bus schedule and pick up points…. However, the staff who replied my messages seems not very familiar with the hotel that she properly needs training. The pre-arrival experience is overall not satisfied.   The manager on duty , Ian greeted us once we arrived the hotel and extended apology for our pre-arrival experience.   We have reserved 2 rooms and were being arranged 2 gorgeous connecting room with sea view. Even we are 4 ladies in total , the rooms are very spacious.  Thank you Maggie and Kevina for the arrangement.  The room layout is not anything fabulous but is clean and well prepared. Thank you Housekeeping manager, Kim for following up our requests. Your service is very attentive.   We had buffet at night time in the Café. The cold plate and seafood are outstanding, however, there are not many hot plate choices.  We did not see the birthday cakes which were supposed to be delivered during our dinner time when we were out to the café. Sadly, it was not there even we arranged with the reception during our check in process. It seems there are miscommunications between the desk and the in room dining. Anyway, we finally got the cake at around 10pm. Still, we are happy for the birthday treats, the 2 brownie cakes are nice.  On the next day, we chose to have dim sum in the Chinese restaurant. The restaurant layout is just a casual one but the food is delicious. The manager, Ian came to extend apology regarding the cake incident. We are quite surprised and thank you for the service recovery again.   One of our friend went to the pool before leaving. It is quite nice to have an indoor pool but it was really too crowded and noisy.  Knowing that it is a weekend in summer time, we understood it is unavoidable.   At last, thank you Ian for following up my Bonvoy points after my departure. Even we experienced some incidents during our stay but you did a very good job!

The terrace, located above the restaurant, has tables and lounge chairs and provides an excellent view of the sea and the dome of the Blue Mosque.  Many restaurants surround the hotel and is a ten minute walk to Sultanmyhet (sp?) Square, Grand Bazar , museums, and the Tram. The staff is very acommodating.  Because of the length of my stay (three nights or more) I received a free pickup from the airport. For a return there is a travel service around the corner and provided transportation for about $5 for an early flight.  The ""gym"" was adequate for a light workout consisting of barbells, a Universal-type machine and a aerobic machine. All in all good value for the money.",2
31324,"My boyfriend and I, after 5 months, met each other on this resort. It was a great experience and this resort made my trip to an unforgettable vacation. Pools, beach, restaurant were nice. Staffs don’t know to much english but it was ok .",2
51927,"Staff working there are extremely friendly, caring and professional.Kelly and Sunny working in the horizon lounge are very helpful.  They speak English well. The room view is stunning, it is next to the west lake and located very central and convenient with lots of shops and shopping centres surrounded by.  The Kerry centre is just next door and has internal access from the hotel to the shopping mall. There are a lot of good choices of restaurants as well.  The hotel is very new. The facility is excellent with very spacious gym and swimming pool, spa and sauna.   I love this hotel, it is one of the best hotel In Hangzhou. It’s my fourth time staying here. I will definitely recommend mid town shangari-la Hangzhou to all of you.",2
8673,"Nice basic hotel in central Singapore, close to all amenities. Nice room with everything you need at hand. Good buffet breakfast with choices to suit most nationalities. There is a restaurant and bar which serve reasonable food, but Singapore offers so many choices of food outlets , we only used it the night we arrived. We used the bar a couple of times, but the seating was in the same area as the restaurant and a bit basic. The staff here were really pleasant and helpful, and coed well with the stress of the corona-virus hanging over everyone. All in all a good base to use in Singapore.",2

6035,"Got amazing last minute deal to NobleDen. Toiletries, furniture is modern and pleasing. Lobby is cramped but that is made up by great roof deck. Walk to little Italy and Chinatown restaurants. Only -ve is the room we got had balcony facing back with HVAC of surrounding buildings emitting hot polluted air so basically balcony was useless.",2

Very impressed with the quality of the accommodation - the room was clean, spacious and the bed was far more comfortable than some hotels with more grandiose aspirations. The bed was made and bathroom was cleaned every day without fuss. The shower was powerful and water was always hot. There was also lots of space for bags and clothes storage.   The location is also 5-star. All the major historical sites are within easy reach and it is only a short walk to the beautiful Villa Borghese. There are plentiful excellent bars and restaurants nearby also.  Can't wait to visit and stay again!",2
9703,My second ultra cleanse visit to Atmanjai. Well worth the trip again. Reduced my blood pressure and lost some weight. Will definitely come back again. Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was large and comfortable.,2
27289,"This was our first time staying at an all inclusive resort. Based on reviews and price point, I was expecting top tier everything. The property is absolutely stunning. Everything looks picture perfect, but there were a few misses.   Service- The service can be a little hit or miss. Waiting on food takes a very long time, even if there is no one else in the restaurant. We had little kids with us, so the long waits took a toll. Some waiters were right on top of refilling drinks, while others never came back to our table. The man checking out kayaks and paddle boards checked a paddle board out to my 14 year old one day, but told him he had to be 18 or older the next day. I’m unsure what the actual rule was. Kids club staff were great! Our kids loved going. Fernanda was always so friendly.  Food- There are a ton of food options, but I thought the food was average in taste. Nothing just wow’d me. There aren’t any quick grab and go food options besides sweets and pool side food during lunch. Even with Buffett you have to check in with the hostess and wait to be seated before getting your food.  The Mixed drinks have very little alcohol in them but they tasted good.   Room- The rooms were super nice. Beds were so comfortable and the air conditioners were perfect. The housekeepers did a fantastic job. The person who restocked the minibar didn’t come every day. We had to catch him twice and ask for items. Our shower didn’t drain very good and we would be standing in deep water by the end of the shower.  ",2
14268,"I was met from my car, arranged by the hotel 20 euros from Ataturk airport and its 40 euros from the New Istanbul Airport, the car cant get to the hotel so it drops you about 50 mtrs and they come and carry your case for you.  I don't actually know how i found this hotel, but after a lot of reviews i decided to book. as with a lot of other people i agree that this hotel is really nice. its basic and not many facilities, but you don't need them, you need a great big comfy bed and a great shower and this hotel supplies both. its all wooden floors so of course you can hear other people 'banging' around from the less thoughtless people but my room 301 had a nice space, a sofa and air conditioning. in my room rate it offered breakfast, it isn't much but they service egg dishes all cooked fresh and some of the nicest, freshest bread i've tasted, the only thing i didn't like was taking the toast out of the toaster with metal tongues!!!   Mustafa was lovely and i didn't catch the other guys name but he was just as lovely.   The shopping area is a very short walk from the hotel and there is so much to do. I always fit in quickly with the cities i visit and everything works well, you can walk on the road dodging the cars but its a really welcoming city, ive been to Istanbul before but i fell in love with Taksim area, even the riot police i seen on a daily basis was a nice welcome to see. the shopping is endless and so are the cafe's .  Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Istanbul and give Next2 hotel a good look before choosing your hotel needs, i normally choose a big name hotel but Next2 had everything i needed.   if you're coming here for the television (then that's just sad) but there aren't any English channels.",2
16773,"This hotel boasts an almost ideal location. It sits right on top of a subway station with direct access to both airports (without changing lines) and Seoul main station. To almost every sight, you can go easily by subway from the hotel.  Check in was nice and efficient. Right next to the reception there is a Convenience store (7-11) with good prices and an OK choice.   The rooms are rather spacious for Asian standards and have all you need. However the beds were too soft for me.  The pool is nice, good temperature, but can get crowded. As usual in Asia: bring your swimming cap.   Breakfast has a good choice but the variety could be a little better. Lots of sweets, not so many vegetables. More local choices would be nice too!  All in all, due to the convenience of the location and the fair price, I would come here again.",2
63944,We rented the 1 bedroom suite.  Very large unit for NY.  We were 4 adults and it was perfect.  Not much dishes in the kitchen but easy and fast service to bring us what we needed.  Overall nice place to stay. ,2
15781,"The H10 Art Gallery is in a lovely quiet location. The entrance lobby is very welcoming and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We had a welcome drink and a short period of free parking before we returned the rental car. At our request we were given (3) rooms close to each other  which was much appreciated. Each floor is decorated in the artwork of a particular artist which we liked. We had a comfortable room facing the terrace area with a small balcony. There is however very little privacy here and we also noticed there was noise coming from the neighbouring rooms so it was not as soundproof as we would have preferred. There is not much space in the room to put your clothing and travel items.  If there were some hooks on the wall and behind the doors this would have helped with this.  The light in the mini bar section was motion sensitive and I found this  a bit disturbing as I am a restless sleeper. I know I could have closed the sliding panel to stop this. The Nespresso machine was a nice touch but I would have preferred a small kettle so that I could have tea as well. The elevator took a long time to come which was a bit annoying. We did not try the hotel breakfast or bar facilities in the hotel. The pool area was small but inviting. It was too cold to swim however. The location is excellent and very safe. It is also close to the major sights, shopping districts and some very nice restaurants.  It was overall a pleasant stay.  ",2
57380,"The room has good size.  The location is very central, with the taxi stand across the street.  Very close to Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain.  We walked everywhere, except the Vatican, which we took the taxi there, and took the metro back.  Recommended!",2
14661,"Edsa Shangri-La will always be the top choice for our family. The rooms are very nice and tidy, the staff are very friendly and showed genuine care and concern. Special mention to the staff of the Laundry Department for the very clean towels and  beddings,  the housekeeping dept for their friendliness and attentiveness, Ms Tess Tugawin who took time out to check on us and made sure that our amenities are complete. Thanks also for the towel-cake set up and the special heavenly cake you provided.  Bianca of Front Desk was very cordial and knew her job well. Shoutout also to Joanna of Reservations department who clearly explained the details of our booking. The friendly and smiling staff at the Pool area, especially Mavic Rolda, Angelica and the staff manning the pool counter who graciously assisted us with our floaters. Edsa Shang's pool is beyond compare to the other hotels we stayed at. My kids had so much fun despite the rains😀. Special shoutout to the staff of HEAT, especially Lesley Gan-Sur and Me-ann Bautista, who, despite of the busy hour, took time out to make sure our needs are met, and we had an amazing dining experience. Thanks for remembering my husband's birthday by giving him a cake. Special mention also to Jessie the magician, who entertained us with his funny antics and magic tricks. This is truly our second home, a place that we will always choose to go home to. ",2

6492,"This hotel is located in the embassies district on a slight hill.  Quiet location within walking distance to the Charles Bridge, and  Prague Castle.  The tram is just down the street.  There is a local, small bus that runs up the hill to the hospital and will stop in front of the hotel.  Guests are greeted by knowledgeable staff and given an overview of the history of the hotel and area as well as directions to popular sights.  Breakfast is good with a choice of eggs and cereals.  We would highly recommend and would stay there again.",2
10978,"The location of the hotel is fantastic and close to all the main tourist areas.  Penn Subway station is just across the road from the hotel, we took the train from JFK airport to Penn station.  The hotel is clean,well maintained and very security conscious.  The shower in the bathroom was either boiling hot or freezing cold.  We booked with Virgin so we didn’t have any extra taxes etc to pay.  The view from our room was amazing and the beds were very comfy. The WiFi worked well.  We didn’t have a problem with paying 5dollars each for the storage or our bags on our last day, we had a night flight back so we left our bags and went shopping for the day. This is a cashless hotel so even for bag storage you have to pay it on your card.  There is a few crazy people outside the hotel but I really don’t think they would do you any harm.  I would love to stay here again.",2
12612,"We were impressed with the service, especially from Abel.  The toilet made a noise and he had it replaced the next day!  The room was large enough for 3 friends. The elevator was there to use but we chose to go up 5 flights of stairs for the fun of it. The view out the small balcony was enjoyable and the street was quiet.  The bathroom was updated/new and the shower was huge.  The things that kept it from being an Excellent rating: slippery in the shower, room too hot unless window was open, no breakfast (but we knew that going in), and not a good light over the sink to do makeup or shave.  The wifi had to be found by walking around the room, but it was there. We would return to this place again!",2
41370,"The staff was without any exception very friendly and will do anything to make your stay excellent and unforgetable. Even the restaurant will try to forefill all your wishes and serve you the real Balinese food. Rooms were inpeccable clean, bed and bathroom were fine and the whole atmosphere in and around the hotel is excellent for those who want to withdraw some time from the hectic of the daily life and just enjoy the view at the seaside and make it a statring point for the exploration of the rest of Bali!",2
36574,"A very good location as you can stroll around and visit Athens heart and most important monuments. And in case you choose to spread your options , the hotel is within 5 min. on foot from the underground and train. A high quality customer centred  service from reception to breakfast service, they met our needs and they were eager to answer questions/ give advice and offer services within their limits. Breakfast served to the room combining quality and quantity. A very cozy accommodation to sleep, a very clean room, good quality mattress, pillows, and despite the size of room which is medium to small, the bathroom is relatively big. The functionality of the room is very good and keeps the noise of urban streets outside.  A good ratio quality to price.",2
6183,"Came down for a business trip for 5 days. The Staff was excellent, very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area, breakfast was good and well stock every morning. The rooms were big and very clean. The shower heads...omg...the showers heads were pure heaven. Most hotels believe that everyone is short. Being a 5'8"" woman, I have had my barely fit under the shower stories. These shower, however, my 6'2"" husband would have been about to stand under with no problem. Thank you Hyatt! The water pressure was amazing as well. Very nice hotel over all.   Now for the Cons: Our company set us aside a block of King rooms. When I got there apparently they ran out of King rooms? The first room I was put in was a double room and the the bed was so hard it felt like sleeping on the floor and the AC roared all night so when the compressor shut off it woke me up. Needless to say did not get much sleep that night.They moved me to a king room the next night (which they told me they would so I knew I only had to suffer that one night) and the bed was softer, not by much (but hotels aren't really know for soft beds), but I'll take it. The shower, however....This is the worst design I have ever seen. The sliding door only opened at the far end of the shower causing you to have to reach all the way to the front of the shower to turn it on. Getting a full naked blast of cold water first thing in the morning was not the wake up call I wanted.  Still was a nice place to stay for 5 days. ",2
5566,"Stayed one  night at the Metropolis on a business trip - it is a lovely building, in the  art deco style in the absolute heart of the city. The room had superb views - of both harbour and park from the 30th floor. The  staff remembered me from other stays and were happy and helpful.  ",2
16647,This is my 2nd trip back to the hotel. It is in a great location by the Marina - within walking distance to the main drag (15 mins or along the boardwalk 20 mins)  The rooms are comfortable and the pool is great as is the gym.  BUT....when we arrive and only AFTER i paid the bill i was told that there was no housekeeping as they were on strike. We stayed for a week and had to empty our bins and ask for new towels. I understand problems happen but there was no communication from the hotel or compensation.  Service around the pool was poor too -   It is a great hotel but in need of support from Hilton - and this should not be a 4 star if there is no housekeeping!!,2

30054,"Sadly, this, our 6th stay at the Shangri-La Bangkok, was far from being the best. We booked a club room and so checked in on the club floor. It was a very unpleasant experience and we were left feeling angry and very unwelcome. We sat in front of the receptionist for around 10 minutes with not a word spoken to us as she stared, sometimes scowled, at the computer screen, presumably  looking for our room, though she never said so. She then pushed our keys towards us and that was that! If we hadn’t paid in advance we would have been gone! Our room, once we found it, was decent with a great view and luggage arrived promptly. Breakfast in the club lounge was very pleasant and we were delighted to meet Ammy again who had always served us so well in the Krungthep lounge. The pool area is brilliantly located next to the river but is very noisy and crowded. The hotel staff (except reception) are all pleasant and helpful. Our favourite Krungthep wing is currently being renovated and I do hope that the quiet elegance is not spoilt or we will have to find another hotel for our trips to Bangkok.",2
39724,The hotel was close to everything and the room was clean and adequate for our family of three. Easy check in and out. They let’s us borrow the umbrellas when it was raining. Close to subway and close to many different restaurants.,2
67385,I only writing this review becuase i read the reviews before booking. This is a good hotel in a great location. I read the reviews about the hotel staff its New york what do you expect. The rooms are clean. And the food at the resturant is good. They do charge 30 dollars a day so i just used it on breakfast and dinks in the afternoon. Overall i will be back there soon.,2
7558,As a frequent business traveller I stay every month in the Pullman Zhuhai. With the warm and professional hospitality and service shown by the staff it really does feel like home from home. Nothing better than winding down after a long day with a glass of wine in the lobby bar. Jasmine is always welcoming and takes the trouble to go that extra yard with her friendly smile and professional attention to detail.....,2
6650,Family of four staying two nights; the location was great and the folks at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. They didn't tell us about the card needing to go in the outlet at the door to turn on the lights but we figured it out.  The room is nice but a bit dated and the pool (while winter and not anticipated to be used) was quite sad. All in all this hotel fit our needs and I have no issues with recommending it.,2
27912,"Lovely place, run by the very lovely Khun Sukanya and her uncle. Extremely welcoming and despite the name, it is more of a chic boutique mini hotel rather than a traditional homestay, but with all that you need to rival any hotel in town.   Situated a few Km's away from the main tourist spots of the city, it suited us just fine to walk or get a short (and cheap) cab ride to wherever we needed, and also get a taste of the real BKK just on your doorstep. Great local markets just a stroll away (day and night) to get your fave street food fix too!  Our room was beautifully fitted out with a great little private balcony/lounge area, and all that you would need for a comfy stay. If there was one gripe to make, we could have done with some wardrobe space rather than the trendy wall pegs to hang your stuff on, but thats no big deal at all... Maybe that was just our room?  A great touch is free use of laundry facilities, which (if you don't want to use an outside service for about 30-40b/Kg) would normally cost a ridiculous amount in a 4-5* Bangkok hotel.  The communal areas on each floor have a cool kitchenette and tea/coffee facilities to use too, so it was nice to wake up to an espresso shot from the pod machine...   For a unique experience in an authentic part of town, you'll feel loved at Loog Choob for sure!",2
12134,We stayed at the Deluxe Sea View room at Skycity Marriott Hong Kong to celebrate father’s day. The executive lounge has currently moved to G/F just next to Lobby. Food provided during dinner session is good but it would be much better if the lounge on 12/F is opened. Sea view from our room provided us a panoramic view of Hong Kong- Zhuhai- Macau Bridge. Great view. Room is spacious and the swimming pool is nice. ,2

33348,"The kids pool and kids club were great. Took my 3 yr old daughter and she had a wonderful time . We spent most of our time at the kids pool with the water slides and also tried a few different things at the kids club. All the ladies were very nice to us. We picked shells by the beach, fed the fishies and hanged out at the club.  It made the experience more round up for her and would recommend for anyone with kids.   ",2
40975,"The reason we chose this hotel was because we will come to Milan by car and this hotel is located outside the ZTL zone and has nice rated. We book the hotel with secure parking which was easy. Though I think you might need to make a reservation during high season. We visited during the COVID-19 and had plenty of spaces.   The room was clean though you’ll hear some noises if room is situated on the side of the street if you are not a deep sleeper like me. My boyfriend didn’t hear a thing. We had everyday bottles of water. One sparkling/ one flat. Also we receive a box of chocolates which I thought was generous. The bathroom amenities was great.   The gentleman who welcomed us on October 14th around 11 am was the nicest. Also the gentleman during check out on October 16th was also friendly. Apart from that we didn’t feel the staffs were that friendly. Unlike other places we stayed, usually we were always greeted when we passed by but not here. That was a bit less impression from the hotel.",2
10107,"Currently under some construction, but still a great place to stay. Due to the construction, they couldn’t have our vehicle running and warm for us but they take care of your vehicle.

45378,"The vibe of this hostel is perfect! I attended the free Yoga class the same day I arrived at Thailand. That, plus the atmosphere really helped me to calm down from all the travel tension on my first day in Bangkok. Cool hipster shops around the neighbourhood, bicycle free to use (try to get out when the traffic's not too crowded or you will find it difficult to navigate around, my preferred time is in the morning!), plus the chill + environmentally friendly atmosphere made me really enjoy my stay here. Also it's really nice to be woken up by sunlight from your window every morning :)",2
29187,My partner and I just spent 5 nights at the Sunset Beach Resort.  It was a good place to stay overall.   Pros: * The shuttle bus to Patong saved us a fortune in Tuk Tuk costs. * Away from the hustle and bustle of Patong but close enough to access everything. * The restaurant and bar are reasonably priced  *  Our cleaner Ayemoe did a fantastic job  * The room was spacious and well set out.   Cons: * The bed was hard (Very hard). It was a wafer thin mattress over two beds joined together.  * Most of the staff are more interested in their mobile phones than greeting guest  Tips: * Book your tours from Mr Sam (The Safe Travel & Tour Company) in the lane way behind reception. He can usually get tours for about 50% off the advertised price.  * Get your daily massage also from the girls in the lane way behind reception.  Great massage at a good price.  ,2

Automated omelette machine was very busy and you might have to wait for abit for your turn.  Bathroom is alittle small.

Directly across from station and really good Market food stalls across in the station.  small improvements and comments  ;)   bkfast was send Buffett but plated as you pointed,  OK but overall quality  of food was OK and requested omelette was charged extra (I was informed) but don't think its neccessary.  Next stay I will not have bkfast  but find bakery across street.   N Iron in the room but an Ironing room on 4th floor,  Balcony view was inside but great to have a balcony. great marketing portrait behind the front desk (look at other painting behind as well).  Masks were worn and Remote was sanitized,  may need to request an extra blanket) delivered promptly as I thought the one on the bed to be very thin.    Overall I was very happy with my stay.",2
15862,"We spent a week at the H10 Art Gallery hotel in Barcelona.  Overall our experience was great. The room was small, but we only went in to sleep and shower since Barcelona is such a wonderful city. The other minimal amount of time we spent at the hotel was at the rooftop pool, which was very nice and offered great views. Get there early if you want to get a good spot though as it is kind of small up there.  The hotel was located in a fairly quiet area, away from much of the hustle of Las Ramblas. Taxi stand right out front and a metro stop a block away.   We chose this hotel specifically on price, which was great. Since we planned to explore the city alot, we didn't require anything fancy, but this hotel went above our expectations. The employees were very nice and the hotel was very clean. The bathroom in the room was also very nice.  We did alot of walking and came back some nights very late and never felt as if the area around the hotel was unsafe.   Next time we might try to stay a little closer to a more ""major"" area, but if you don't mind walking a few extra blocks, this hotel is great.",2
28472,"This was our second time back to this hotel and again we had a great time. While the hotel is right on the beach and offers wonderful facilities it is really the service you receive that makes a stay enjoyable. We could not have been looked after better from the moment we checked in until the time we checked out. Special mention to Sai at reception, all the staff at the club room, the concierge team and the cleaner Eng who made sure our room was spotless. We had an exceptional experience at the Pullman Hotel G, Pattaya and look forward to returning in the future.",2
29713,"Its a good hotel, very neat and clean. Rooms size is spacious. House keeping staff is very courteous. Food in the restaurant is yummy.  Good variety of food in breakfast buffet. For vegetarians- not plenty of options, but still many- like salad, fruits, breads/buns, noodles, muffins, other cakes, yogurt, hash brown/potato wedges / small potato cutlet/ or something similar every day.  So you can make your own customised veg sandwich or burger with different salads and sauces. The hotel has a small cafeteria at the ground level adjacent to reception area, and serves delicious pasteries.  The only thing which I found over expensive here was the RTPCR test. They charge $91 for test where reports are expected to be delivered within 24 hrs and for quick report that gets delivered within 6 hrs they charge $216 per person, which I believe is very expensive.  Rest all is good. There are 3 vegetarian restaurants also available near to the hotel. Grocery shops are too just across the road.  Hotel has its own shopping complex adjacent to the hotel building, many nail salons are available, so ladies do try the nail treatment/ art at a reasonable starting price of ₹20 onwards.",2
67081,"strategic location with 24hours convenience store, supermarket and food outlets just next door. easy access to popular attractions. can ask hotel staff to call for taxi or can choose grab. all in all i would suggest this hotel to others.",2
63100,"I stayed here five nights and got an amazing deal on the room.  The location was perfect – West Hempstead – a few blocks walk to the Underground, Overground, and Thameslink.  There are great bus services nearby but I didn’t use them as the trains were sufficient.  There’s a Laundromat a few blocks away on the high street should you need to do laundry.    Reception was super friendly and accommodating.  My room was cozy and clean, with a kettle, a television, and a sink.  I booked the single, so it was a twin bed, and although the room was on the small side, I didn’t feel cramped.  I was on the top floor, which wasn’t a problem either, but since there’s no elevator, if you cannot do stairs I would speak with the hotel beforehand to see if you can be placed on a lower floor.  I had no issues with the Wi-Fi, nor with the television in the room.  The bathrooms are shared and they are kept clean, but bring your own toiletries.    I don’t know why others are complaining on here about the key deposit, but yeah, you have to leave a £5 deposit, which isn’t the worst thing in the world and you get it back at the end of your stay, but I digress.  I stayed in one of the houses directly across the street from reception.    Just so you know, Charlotte Guest House is more of a B&B type of establishment and is made up of several houses on the street.  You’ll breakfast in the main reception house.  The breakfast was perfect, with many hot and cold choices on offer. The breakfast room is small so it gets crowded and can be chaotic, but that is to be expected when you're all clamoring to eat at the same time in the morning.    London is so expensive, but Charlotte Guest House was an excellent value for the money.",2
60562,"I stayed at the Chicago South Loop Hotel over the Laborday weekend and it was a nice experience. The staff was pleasant, helpful and displayed great people skills.  The rooms were nice and clean plus they're larger than they appear in these pictures.  The hotel is not far from the highway and it's in a great location, not far from many attraction with a ton of stuff within walking distance.  Some amenities you may be use to were missing like a laundry room and typical room service. There parking lots are small and you may have to park on the street if you come back after 10pm like I did each night.  Overall my stay was great beside leaving my portable speaker in my room after I checked out. I would definitely stay there again and suggest it to anyone looking to stay at a nice, affordable, centrally located hotel. I'd give them 4 stars on a scale of 5. ",2
15417,"The use of the space was well-designed. It's amazing to find shower and sink and toilet were all separate, not commonly found even in much larger spaces - this made everything very convenient for us.  The ""ledge"" with pop-up outlets along the beds was very useful to place odds and ends and to charge your electronics.  The hotel is close to subway stops and Ginza is considered a very safe (and affluent) neighborhood.  A great value and altogether a great place to stay in Tokyo!",2
5347,"I thoroughly enjoyed the one night stay at the brand new Shangri-La Yuanqu. I was warmly greeted by Vivien, the Horizon Club Manager, who seamlessly checked me in and led me to my room and I was pleasantly surprised with the welcome set from Dexter, the GM and a veteran in the Shangri-La Group. I was subsequently ushered to the 31st Floor Horizon Club, with a great selection of tapas, dim sum, small bites and mini-burgers. Their cheese selection was delicious too and goes very well with their selection of wines too. And I was super impressed with their state-of-the-art gym, fully equipped with the latest TechoGym equipments. The room was spacious, ambience was great, and the service is top notch! It’s indeed my Home Away from Home! Will be my only choice of hotel in Suzhou Yuanqu! ",2
42665,"This is a vast and impressive hotel  - in fact took several days to work out the best route from the room to the restaurants. The rooms are impressive with high quality furnishings and very well maintained. There is a huge underground spa leading to an indoor pool that also goes outside. The main buffet restaurant is on the lower floor and the few evening meals served there were poor, and often nearly cold. Also the service eg to get drinks was very slow  - so much so we had to complain to the managers - who did a lot of watching but never helped, despite lack of staff. Occasionally food was served upstairs in a small area next to the bar. The quality here was better. Much better to eat out at night in the many restaurants that were in 5-10min walking distance. ",2
8997,"The location is near the old quarter of Bangkok so ideal for sightseeing. The room had everything we needed, the breakfast copious and the welcome and help from Jason was perfect; he sorted out our queries and problems without fuss. So we booked again here for when we returned to Bangkok 3 weeks later. Highly recommended.",2
50739,First all the service of the housekeeping and bayview restaurant staff was exceptional. They were considerate / took time to remember important things and they were well very trained.   The food at Bayview was worth it too!  However that’s where it stops.   The hotel is not up to TAj standard. (We have stayed in a number of them). It needs significant investment. We stayed in a villa on the beach. It was extremely dated and in need of overhaul- they have painted the bath to make it look new ??? And the drains are quite smelly.   We are now at the Connemara and it does not disappoint.   Nothing that the hotel can influence but just a point of note - fisherman’s cove is NOT a beach for swimming. The hotel strikes me as where people go for a work conference not a holiday.   Whilst we were staying there was some type of ministers event and thus there were military personnel camped out in our villa garden all night and both restaurants were drowned out with very loud music. Hence it was also tough sleeping. Whilst it was only for one night - it was 1/3 of our time there. We were told we could only move to another Taj hotel by paying a fine!!!! Also it was only when we pushed that they comp’d the cheapest meal we had. Which was NOT the night that was ruined by the events.   If that’s what you want (ie a conference hotel) then perhaps the fisherman’s cove is for you.,2
62599,"Absolutely amazing place. We booked all the rooms for my family when in London for our youngest sons wedding. 11 adults and 10 children ranging from 2 weeks old to 10 years old!!  Mike could not have been more welcoming and helpful, nothing fazed him. Dave the cook came in specially to cook us all an amazing pre wedding brunch on the Saturday, and all the staff were so helpful in spite of a lot of kiddies to cope with.  We are going to make this our London pad whenever we are in London it really is so good, I am a retired airline pilot and have stayed in some of the best hotels all over the world, all expenses paid of course! And I really mean it when I say this is one of the best.",2
46046,My sister in law stayed here last Weds night. Unfortunately for us London was in gridlock due to strikes so we didn't arrive until 11 30 pm. Hence unable to comment about dinner & the bar! The twin room was spacious. Maybe request view over the river. Beds were comfy if in need of replacement. Very clean. Breakfast was excellent. ,2
44533,Stayed here for 2nights. The reception team were so courteous and very helpful. I called earlier about directions to the hotel from Linate airport and their suggestions about options helpful. The area is quiet. There's a MacD not far off. A shopping mall is about 1.5 - 2miles away. I liked my room. Spotlessly clean and comfy beds. Spacious rooms. Sweet smelling corridors. Very friendly staff from reception team to house keeping staff. Complimentary tea and coffee provided in rooms plus kettle. Ironing facility available on request. A very good ribs restaurant about a Km from the hotel.,2
11025,"Good location  Friendly staff  Neutral point- room is smaller than pictures , we like d our room and comfy enough but if you have room 112 you feel like your in a broom cupboard.   Bad points-  OK so we had a room for 2 nights on booking.com for £286.20 which I chose on options to pay on the day at hotel. A night or 2 before they took half £143.10 which I didn't know. It was a room security payment in case of cancellation. So I thought on the 6th I would just pay other half which would of been fine. But instead they asked for full amount £286.20 which got debited and the other £143.10 left pending on account which affected my spending budgets and now I'm awaiting it back as they say it can take up to 5 days. Not happy !   Need heating in shower room as room felt little cold.",2
28685,"This was really nice hostel: the athmosphere was nice, there are organized events everyday, three times a week they host a delicious vegetarian dinner & give away free snacks. Best things there are still the musical instruments to use and play with your friends or people who you just met and even a (dry) sauna. Maybe my best hostel experience and I have visited a couple.   Even if it looks a little old, it is more far away from many attractions and not everything is in perfect condition, it definitely was worth the money! (well, ended up extending my stay with two days even I had paid the another night in another hostel...)",2
11684,"It was my first experience with a capsule hostel and I must admit it was really good. This place is brand new and very modern. Especially the common areas are very nicely designed and comfortable.  My capsule was cozy and all the areas are exceptionally clean, which is something you definitely want when you stay in a hostel. Their staff is also nice and tries to help with everything. You can borrow anything you need if you are same lazy and forgetful as I am: chargers, electrical adapters, umbrellas, etc.  Big plus is also the fact you can make a coffee, tea or hot chocolate free of charge whenever you want to. And as I was travelling because of work I found that very convenient.  They use iPods instead of cards or keys, so you can use it for the entrance, for setting up your air-con, light, etc.  Location is absolutely perfect, only 3 mins walk from ""the famous"" Shibuya crossing.  The only downside was that I arrived in the early morning, so I had to wait for other 8 hours to check-in. The check-in time could be a bit earlier, not from 3pm.  All in all I would stay here definitely again.",2
288,"The hotel is in a very convenient spot in Trastevere. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and had booked a garden room, which had a small terrace. But it turned out that the heat was not working. The desk clerk, that checked us inn was not the most helpful, saying that the heat was timed and had not switched on. When I said to him that I found it more than a little surprising, since the temp had been around freezing for the past few days and no other place that I had stayed in Trastevere before, had 'timed heat'. He had not reaction. So we went to dinner, but when we returned, our room was still freezing and there was no sign that the heat had been turned on in that room. Fortunately, there was another person at the front desk, who agreed with us and moved us into their apartment/suite for the night. The next morning, on our way to breakfast, we were told that given the problems, we would stay in the apartment for all five nights, we had booked. After that, one problem, we had a great stay. It was very comfortable and quiet.  All of the other staff were very helpful. But the most helpful and friendly was the woman that ran the breakfast room. She made sure that the buffet was well stocked. There was always a freshly baked cake, baked by her every morning. She offered to make fresh eggs, if you wanted. Overall, this is one of the best places we have stayed on all our trips to Rome.",2
51896,"We used this hotel for a weekend escape from bustling Shanghai. Easy to reach by high-speed train and local subway lines this hotel is in the heart of Hangzhou. Walking distance to the Westlake, the Kerry Center shopping mall just next to it and easy to move around the city. The chekin was very fast, so our kids didn't get bored. The bar with an own brewery offered us a welcome beer after arrival. The hotel offers a nice indoor pool, which we used for some waterplay before going to the city. For breakfast we were catered with one of the best and hugest buffets I have ever seen - everyone can find here the own choice. All in all a great place to stay with family and visit Hangzhou.",2
13511,"We stayed for four nights.  We were on first floor-no view but quietest hotel room I have ever encountered.

We traveled with grandson.",2
12642,"Stayed here for 5 nights. The ibis rooms are small, but clean and neat. As a couple it was just managable even with our bags. Hotel staff are ok but security personal do not even greet you even after 5 days. Aircon was not efficient until we tested various rooms and eventually moved to the opposite side of the building.This hotel does have the advantage of being opposite a big mall and subway train station. If i had to visit moscow again i would try out antother hotel.",2
49851,"We weren't sure what to expect but in fact the hotel is well located.   It's a short walk to the parliament and the changing of the guards, and not far to catch a tourist bus.  (There is a lot of graffiti in Athens and that can be disquieting. )  The hotel itself is of a high standard. I suggest a high rear room to reduce road noise.  The top level has a bar and a daytime swimming pool. Just be aware that it closes early evening before reopening.  The view over the rooftops is superb.  One to go back to. ",2
35256,"This hotel is in a perfect location to make the most of a sightseeing trip to Paris. It's a little pricey but it's so close to many attractions, particularly the Musee D'Orsay and Louvre, which means you don't waste time travelling. Access to the metro is also convenient and the area is very safe. Rooms were spacious (for Paris) and service was pleasant. We were able to store our bags before and after our stay, which was also incredibly helpful. ",2
220,"I booked this place based on other reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  It is in the heart of Trastevere and walkable to both St. Peters Basilica and the Colosseum.  Our room had a private garden, which was lovely.  We woke up in the morning to the church bells ringing!  The room was small but clean and sufficient.  There was a small refrigerator and electric kettle to use.  Breakfast was available every morning and was delightful.  I'm gluten free and there were more than enough choices for me, including toast and cereal!  John Carlo managed the desk and was so very helpful in giving us information on how to get to places.  Right across the street is a taxi stand so we usually just went there and took taxi's to locations that we couldn't walk to.  Make a right out of the hotel and you are in heart of Trastevere with tons of restaurants and shops!  Trastevere is so fun to walk through in the evenings with little cobblestone streets, churches and fountains.  We felt safe at all times but were usually back in our room before 11 pm.  I read that Italians tend to dress up a bit for dinner but in Trastevere everyone wore flat shoes.  Even with dresses or skirts.  Dress is comfortable but neat, no shorts or T shirts.  We had wifi at the hotel and had no issues with connection.  I would return to Relais Le Clarisse if in Rome again!",2
23179,"It’s ok for short stay but the “double bed” was 2 joined single bed and it keeps moving around. so if 2 people plan to sleep together, either you stick to 1 bed and squeeze in or forget about it. also the mattress seems like it’s the cheapest one you could find in the market.  the sofa was super old but they still put it there. the leather of the sofa was chipping off ALL over! it would be way better to just take it out, maybe the rating would be higher.   though it’s good location super close to the metro station and super market. and the staff are nice.

22241,This is a very nice and tranquil Bed and Breakfast operation.  Not the most convenient location (there is not much going on in the neighborhood so it's always an Uber ride).

Derek was very helpful with our bags before we left and held them for us until we departed since we did some sight seeing before our late flight.  The only downside of our trip was a water pipe bursting our last day and only having ice cold water to shower with.,2

52084,"Searching for the perfect sty in Santorini can be overwhelming.  Look no further than Hotel Kavalari! We arrived in the nick of time for sunset on our first visit to Greece.  The crowds even in September were 5-6 deep on the Main Street in Fira. But alas, our hotel, atop the Caldera boasts 4-5 terraces which we had to ourselves.  A small bottle of wine in our room fridge added to our pleasure after our 20 hour journey.  We could not have asked for better.   Our room was breezy and comfortable.  Do not be intimidated by the complaints of stairs.  They are wide & well laid out  with safety rails. Take your time!  It’s the Caldera. This is what keeps Greeks alive far beyond others.   The bed was a traditional platform euro mattress with clean fresh crisp sheets. And again- the view!   Ahhhhmazing. Right out our door!  The complimentary breakfast was delightful. An egg, ham & cheese, croissants and  other Greek breads with tasty toppings.  The best yogurt and fresh fruit ever and pots of hot tea and coffee.   This location cannot be beat, smack dab in the middle of the Main Street just steps from every recommended restaurant, shop, gelato spot and nightly entertainment.  But don’t fear the sound, we were not distracted one bit from the crowds above as we nestled in to a fine bing Hts sleep.   Demetrius and all of the staff were helpful beyond compare and arranged transportation from the airport and to the ferry port.   We will make this our future go to destination any time we return to Santorini",2
38589," Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Horizon in Karon. I wanted somewhere that was aimed at adults and also away from the hustle of Patong but still with options to visit markets, beaches and restaurants. Horizon delivered.  The accommodation I got was in the adult wing which included the Club Lounge so enjoyed spirits and nibbles between 12-2pm. The time wasn't ideal but when free drinks involved you make it work. The drinks were great except the cola (not coke). The food was usually hot food but cold by the time you ate it but still hit the spot. Never needed lunch!   Breakfast was quite varied and plenty on offer. Then banquet dinners were available too including entertainment. A visit to one during your stay is worthwhile but probably not any more than that.  The room and resort werent new and some aspects were a little dated but it didnt detract from the enjoyable stay.  I spent my time swimming (mainly in the adults wing pool), borrowing free DVDs for nights (from adult wing club), reading and chilling in their sun lounges and was lovely.  With the beach and restaurants just down the hill it was easy to get out and about which is a must for me as I dont like being resort bound. The shuttle takes you up and down the hill but at times can take ages or not turn up especially within 30 mins of 9pm....so after a while I just walked.  Affordable laundry is available 20m from the resort near the top of the hill on the left as heading towards the beach.  Staff were lovely too.   Definitely recommend as for the price it was a great package.  Not perfect by any means but still plenty of great points and I wouldnt hesitate to stay their again - in the adults wing.",2
868,"Comfortable Beds, quality bed linen and pillow selection as any 5 star hotel. appreciated the wardrobe and hanging space, clean bathroom. Affordable stay, close to ICC.

Ufortunatley after 3 hour of my check out I realized that I forgot my earphones on my bed, but when I returned to ask for them they told that nobody of the cleaners saw them. In that room we were only 4 at that time and the two other girls went out 1 hour before us. However I suggest this hostel, but don't forget anything.",2
57505,"Spacious rooms, superb air-conditioning, all clean; staff was friendly and pleasant, and prompted us where to dine out in the area, which was helpful. The hotel is next to some repairing works in the nearby restaurant, but they do apologize for any inconvenience caused.   The breakfast was mostly cold, with a couple of hot options (scrambled eggs and sausages) included; they’d run out of eggs by the time we started our breakfast.   Overall, it was good value for money.",2

After staying in the BLOC hotel chain many times I knew what to expect, check in and out was very easy, my room was available ahead of time which was fantastic, the room was clean and as long as you don’t mind the compact nature of the room it does the job.

Our family room was just like the website pictures which were serviced each morning with a lovely croissant breakfast, tea, coffee and juice offered daily.  Even with our early departure Jacinta continued to look after us providing croissants in our room the afternoon prior in readiness for our early morning departure.  The kitchen was sufficient for our needs allowing us to buy groceries and fix an easy meal after a big day out.

30002,"An excellent hotel situated on the river in Bangkok. The view you get depends very much upon where you stay in the hotel as it is curved and as a result some rooms have a decent view of the river and some might not  - worth checking if you want the view. As a Shangri La it is 5* and it delivers n most respects. The room and staff were excellent - my only criticism, is that the staff, whilst universally friendly and helpful were a little ""corporate"" - in other words you wondered at their sincerity. The Concierge team are really helpful with city maps, directions, taxi's and places to eat, so make sure you engage with them. The reception changes money but yo might guess that the offered rates aren't too hot. The bar is wonderful with a fabulous view over the river and you can spend hours just watching the boats plying their trade.  The pool is pretty good and well covered with life guards - the sunbeds are perhaps the best I have ever splatted upon. It overlooks the river. Breakfast is international as you would expect with everything frm bacon and omelettes to Chinese, Indian etc.... My main criticism is that breakfast can get busy (they run a traffic light system) and I had to wait 10 minutes for a cup of tea - this might not seem long - especially if you are on holiday, but it is a 5* hotel and I would expect better from the staff who were a little overworked and appeared stressed - they need more people or a better system. Everything in Bangkok is within a 150Baht taxi ride (Palace, Chinese Market etc.) and the concierge will sort a taxi for you. BEWARE of taxi's that are not metered as they can tend to jack up the price. If you like orchids, the display in reception is fantastic and the overall quality of the public areas is excellent. Would I stay here again - we did a second visit a few days later - the Centara Grand, which is nowhere near as good (see separate review)",2

We stayed at the Club Level and at this property, Club Registration is on the 34th floor and you bypass registration.  In addition, the breakfast, cocktail hour, pupus and a concierge to help with directions and transportation all justify the cost.  Highly recommended!",2
17772,Fresh and tasty breakfast. Nice view on sunrise from the room. My wish/need for frontal view on the sea has been considered. Very helpful staff who helped with quad reservation. I recommend this hotel. Silent and close to the beach and restaurants.,2
64194,"Very nice hotel though in a quieter area, a bit dark at night. Staff were helpful & breakfast spread was good. We had a room high floor facing north. Quilt was too thin & aircon no heater. Wore 3 layers & socks at night through our 4 days stay there. ",2
2666,"Samuel and his wife are very friendly and very accommodating. They can speak good English. They will provide you with a map of HK and Macau if needed. My partner and I arrived early and we left our things in the hotel while we had our lunch. When we got back, our room is ready and our luggage is already inside our room.    The place is accessible to MTR, bus stops (especially A1, bus to the airport) and restaurants. If you want to go to Macau, the place is a few minutes walk to the Ferry Terminal.   The place is clean and tidy. They have microwave to reheat the food.  They have water dispenser and refrigerator. They have utensils and plates that you can use and they will wash it for you.   I recommend this place and if I will go back to HK, I will definitely stay on this place again. :)",2
57618,"The hotel was conveniently located for access to Sydney Central Station, supermarkets and other stores by foot.  The surrounding neighbourhood was quiet.  The room was clean, tidy and well lit.  The check-in staff were friendly and helpful and exit early the next morning was simple, enabling us to catch our bus at 6.40 am.",2
21090,"My fiance and I had an excellent breakfast (2 mornings) in this lovely and old restaurant 2 weeks ago! Lots of sweet and salt food, ice cream and wine are also available! Omelettes are express made! The team are very gentle and quick! The location is a very old building, they have arranged the old courtyard which is covered in case of rain, with lots of plants and sun light- The costs are low, the bread is delicious! The building is also a little hotel, they also have  some independent rooms in a building in the old Jewish district JOvanov, where we stayed, very calm and modern furnitures!",2
23675,"We stayed at the Palladian Home September 18 2018.  We were finishing up our honeymoon before flying home the next day.  The hotel is a nice boutique hotel located in the heart of the Plaka district.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and were even allowed to check in to our room before 11 am since our room was ready.    The real highlight was actually when we were trying to leave the next day.  We had arranged a pick up with a company we had found online.  The hotel is difficult to find if you are in a car as the hotel is not accessible to automobiles.  One of the hotel employees, Pantelis noticed that we had been standing out front for a little bit of time and asked us if we needed to arrange transportation.  We told him we had already booked something on our own.  After some more time, Pantelis stopped to check on us again.  He offered to call the driver to see where he was from his own cell phone.    Pantelis then spent the next 10-15 minutes on and off of the phone with the driver trying to direct him where to pick us up at.  The driver was obviously not experienced with Athens and eventually had to cancel the pick up altogether.  Needless to say this was very stressful for us as we were trying to catch our flight home!  Pantelis was able to grab a random taxi for us and negotiated a flat fee to the airport despite the taxi driver trying to scam us.    When I tried to give Pantelis a tip for all of his help he simply stated ""there is no need, it is my job to make sure that our guests are happy"".  The hotel is in an excellent location for those looking for somewhere near the Acropolis in the heart of Athens with lots of shops and tavernas around and the staff are amazing!",2
39852,"Very close to Meongdong, just exit 3 of tube station with escalator,  limousine bus stop is just over the road.  The room is OK, shower is OK, very clean, but very noisy next room until midnight.  There is a coffee shop on the ground floor.",2

Mattress is good, pillows are soft (to me) but nothing a little folding can't solve. Bathroom has a fabulous rain shower, big bath and heated toilet seat. The restaurants are amazing, many local choices (also continental BF), lots of fruits and always fresh. Breakfast was a joy every day, esp their to-go cappuccino! Staff is very friendly and speak excellent English. The service at the spa (a private expense) was incredible, ask for Hani. Get on their loyalty program! Well worth it. I hope to stay here again.

21539,"We are not fans of huge (here 1400 room) impersonal hotels where the lobby is inevitably full of piles of luggage of arriving and departing guests with a short average length of stay. As this hotels go, the Keio Plaza is typical. Staff is friendly and helpful, but the scale of the place renders any personal service almost impossible. We stayed for two nights in a Club Level room on the 39th. floor of the main tower. The view was incredible, as was the view from the even higher 45th. floor club room. That room was also on a vast scale, although very well staffed, and required reservations for breakfast - presumably because of the large number entitled to eat the there. Staffed with many young Japanese the atmosphere was pleasant but the staff were remote, possibly because of the scale of the property and the somewhat reserved nature of their customs. The bedroom was clean and well equipped with amenities (apart from coffee and creamer for the in room coffee maker). The bed was very comfortable, the room was quiet and could be blacked out. The bathroom was more than adequate and the shower was full force with a steady stream of water as hot as one could select and stand. The lavatory of course was the plush Japanese standard. Included breakfast was a vast buffet of Japanese and European/American selections with chefs ready and able to freshly prepare special dishes.",2
53506,"OK but for the price i paid i expected to have a proper safe baby cot. my baby was sleeping and the mattress fell from underneath, thank God i was next to her and managed to grab her. no other baby cot was offered, had to make our 7 month old sleep on the sofa bed. the night security acted as the luggage boy and not friendly.",2
31269,"I travelled to Czech Republic with my friend. We stayed at this hotel in March and the our stay was quite pleasant. We really liked the receptionist there that helped us to park our car and also said a lot of interesting things about Prague. Our room was quite small, but it is ok as we reserved budget one. I also want to note that room was very clean, staff changed our towels and shower supplies every day. The greatest thing about hotel Wenceslas square is its location. It is in the centre of Prague, very near to metro station. All in all, it was nice experinece and we would visit this hotel again.  P.s. we also received card with discouts to Prague sights and gift voucher for our next stay. Thanks!!!",2
58333,"This is my second stay within a month for bus trip. Hotel:  Nice, clean, modern hotel. Small outside poool and inside equipted gym are the plus.  Room is very modern with fully kitchen.  I am here for work so i did not use the kitchen, but it will be good for a family vacation.  Breakfast is ... so so compared with other hotels around here. Service: Good customer service and the staff (most of front desk ladies & housekeepers) were very friendly and helpful. Especically, Maria (sorry i forgot your long last name) went out her way to help me when I arrived a little early and when my flight was delayed a couple hours.   Thank you very much Maria.",2
35522,Very enjoyable stay at Gasometer - good service from all the front desk receptionists. Hotel seems very brand new and the room is huge compared to other hotels in Rome. Breakfast is also good with selection of good and hot items.  Would reccomend it. Only negative side is that the hotel is not in the centre but there is a metro near by approximately 10 minutes by walk. ,2
64551,"The first room lighting is not good, the windows can't be opened and it's frosted glass, so the room is dark ,can't concentrate on work, but the second room feels good, there is a long table near the window, the light is good, and the contrast of the first room is great, but there is no bathtub, the room is not  Daily cleaning, shampoo, shower gel and towels need to be replaced by contacting the service desk.",2

45908,We stayed here 6 nights. Check in was quick and staff was very kind. Parking is free which is a big bonus in SF. Room was clean. No microwave and fridge big disappointment. You can rent a fridge for $5/night. We asked for a quite room because we were travelling with young kids we got one on the 3rd floor facing the busy Lombard street.the traffic was so load we couldn’t fall asleep before midnight and we were up every day from 6. It is close to everything. Could recommend it but also the hotel needs to do something about the windows or stop charging so much for their rooms ,2
28742,"Very friendly staff and a lot of backpackers. We met some really nice people and it was a blast. Lots of activities or just places to chill. Rooms are all mixed up, but people in general think about the others in the rooms. ",2
2999,I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Amazing location and also very helpful staff they know the real meaning of hospitality. They made me feel am at home they where very kind and helpful to my little baby they where taking care of her and making her smile all the time. I managed to change my room the second day with out any charge. The breakfast was really good and you can eat as much as you like. This hotel has a wonderful roof terrace you can see the sunset and the sea view from a good view. Location wise it's next Sokol Mohamet mosque and 5min walk from the blue mosque and Hagia Sophia and 10min walk from the grand bazar and 5min from the nearest tramp station. ,2
44973,"Our room has 2 large window wall which is just amazing plus the 2 layer curtain can be controlled remotely! It was fun just playing it. There were TV embedded behind the mirror of washroom. The washroom was fancy as well, clean, bright, and with digital toilet lol.   The day started with a buffet brunch with free flow of oysters, staff were friendly and serve fast. The bar has a glass floor which was a bit scary for me but rest of our crew enjoyed walking on it. You can see view of 40+ floor under your feet! The live band was also impressive!  We arranged one night stop in Hangzhou. If we knew the room can be this amazing we would arrange one more day.   This was a Memorial Day!",2
24229,"Well, perhaps just secret from me. I lived in the city for a long time and hence didn't know too much about the hotel situation here, but in our search for lodging for a weekend trip, we found the city to be very expensive! The Grove Inn, however, had a great price (best price I found, incidentally was booking directly with them) and good reviews. So I was a little worried before arriving, but as it turns out, I shouldn't have been.  It's somewhere between a traditional B&B and a hotel. It honestly felt a bit like we had an apartment and were living in SF instead of just vacationing for the weekend. Something about the facade of the building, and the fact that it's on a very residential street.  Our room was small, but nice and clean. Staff is very friendly. Some reviews mentioned having trouble with the lobby door, so we were a bit worried about that. But this must have been an old issue. It's now a key fob system and it gave us absolutely no trouble.  There was one hiccup with breakfast, but the staff proactively made it right without us having to say anything, so they honestly scored points with this.  This will be my go to SF hotel from now on.",2
38063,"Hubby and I have just spent 5 nights at this beautiful little getaway.  This is a family-run establishment and everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The huts are very comfortable and the pool is generous in size considering there are only 5 huts.  The quality and variety of food at the restaurant was also very comparable with other places around.  We had a scooter for just one day to explore the island and Ceningan Island.  After exploring the rest of the island we were even happier with our choice of Cubang Huts.  You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere but you are only 2 mins walk to Dream Beach, another 2 mins walk to the Devil’s Tear and less than 10 mins walk to Sunset Beach and approx 20 mins walk to Mushroom Bay.  Would highly recommend.",2
10740,"We stayed for 8 nights and would definitely stay here again. They are a Disney Good Neighbor hotel so they have a free shuttle running to/from the parks (make sure to book ahead as it does have limited space). The hotel is also one of the drop off/pick up locations for the Airport Limo for both Narita and Haneda which makes it very convenient for flights.   The room was perhaps small by Western standards but we barely spent any time in it so it was fine for us. Large bed! We didn't get a Sky Tree view but the view from our 21st floor room was great! 2 free waters are provided daily, as well as toothbrushes, hairbrushes, and other amenities.  The staff was pleasant and efficient. The breakfast buffet is extensive, although we didn't have it included our room price. We ate there 3 times ($19 USD) because it was convenient but  there's also quite a few coffee shops right down the street at the train/bus station which is about a 5 minute walk down the street.   We would not hesitate to stay here again!",2
17322,"The hotel looks like its brand new, very modern and stylish. The free and secured car park is perfect. It even has a roof.   Staff is very nice. The mark for you the best spots to visit on a city map and sell you the subway tickets.  The quick ride with the subway is really the best option to explore the city. It's literally 1 minute walk from the hotel and very nice and clean. Breakfast is also quite decent and very large selection for the price.   The only thing to consider is that you occasionally hear the airplanes in the morning and evening which can be quite loud for a minute there. Didn't bother me. Also worth noting is that the rooms only have wired internet. It's free and the cable is provided, but if you want to surf via tablet or mobile phone you have to come to the lobby to use the free wifi there. There are plenty of comfy couches and a TV so many guests hang out here to check their mails.   All in all a top hotel. Next time I'm in Prague I'll stay here again.",2
60866,Our 2 night stay at the metro was good. The zero parking made it a little challenging being new to the city. Overall a pleasant stay. The room was good and the staff was very accommodating. It is in a safe area of the city as well. ,2
10129,"We stayed at the private room with bathroom. I will stay again surely. Nice place, basic buffet, but tasty. Many public transportation near the hostal. Just the metro is little bit far (14 min). Excellent choice. Me and my wife only had two difficulties: 1. and the most annoying , was the bathroom light; it can be only turn on by movement, long sessions in the bathroom, may result in total darkness. 2. The elevator, was hard to use at first, it had its trick to make it work, most of the visitors have the same issue. But once you got it, is easy to use.",2
12055," I had a delicious breakfast and friendly hospitality of the manager and staff for staying for 10 days. Small but clean and had a pool. If I come back to Bangkok again, it will stay at this hotel.",2
65565,"Positives  - Great service by staff. The hotel manger came out to drop us to taxi for airport  - restaurants in vicinity eg pizza, burgers - clean hotel and can borrow umbrella - good swimming pool  - welcome drink options   Negatives - location not great as can't walk to Orchard road  - checking in took so much time and no acknowledgement of gold membership  - terrible tasting waffles at breakfast  - very old and dirty tea kettle in room.  - there was a hotel trainee staff who broke the coffee queue at the breakfast and made us wait. He saw us waiting and instead of helping just filled up his coffee ",2
19359,"My wife and I stayed at the Palm Gallery Hotel for our 4-night break to Rome. I researched hotels online and found the reviews of the hotel to be encouraging, so made the reservation. The hotel is small and intimate with all the staff we met being very friendly. The included breakfast was nice and the omelettes were particularly tasty. Prior to making the booking we were fully aware of the location being a bit out of the city centre, but in hindsight found this to be a bit too far for our needs, and in future we would choose a more central hotel. Unfortunately the weather was not great during our trip, so we only managed to have breakfast on the outdoor terrace on one occasion in 4 days. This was a shame as the terrace looked a lovely place to start the day. Similarly, the outdoor pool area looked nice but we did not have the opportunity to use as a result of the weather. Our terrance room number RD on the ground floor was of ample size with high ceilings was nice with a comfortable bed, but being just behind the public reception/bar areas did have minor noise issues. One thing I would recommend though is blackout blinds and the room was very light from dawn onwards. Overall a nice hotel which is exactly as described, but we unfortunately could not experience at it's best because of the weather. We would however stay closer to the city centre next time.",2
14344,"I booked this hotel for my family travel after reading most of the reviews.True enough,no one was exaggerating.From the time we arrived to the time we checked out(reluctantly off course) we had  great impression of the hotel especially the staff running and manning the place.I booked the duplex for my family of 6  4 teenagers) for 8 nites and all of us were in love with the rooms and the view it offered.Location wise is without a doubt the best!A 2 min walk out to Istiklal St and from there you can choose to go to Taksim or down to Galata.For vintage and antique lovers,Cucurcuma is less than 5 mins away.The hotel is 2 doors away from Taksim police station.We had a great time here.We would love to come back to Istanbul again and stay at this very same hotel.To Mustafa,Mursel,Tolga and another staff whom I cannot recall the name,thank you so much for making our stay as comfortable as you can possibly offer with your helpfuless and kindness.",2
65076,"The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the second floor and had no lift access. Room was modern, clean and comfortable. Very nice, clean bathroom with a great shower. The continental breakfast was very limited, no non dairy butter or milk options. No toast on offer. There were about 5 women sat in a side room, talking loudly, with, what looked like staff uniform on, not doing anything, Disappointing breakfast but a nice clean space.",2
15966,"We stayed here for our honeymoon on the Club floor. Room was a great size and clean. A little noisy from the pipes in the building and the sound of others rooms when flushing the toilet for example. Air con was also very loud so we turned it off in the end. Staff are friendly but I was surprised, especially being in a club room, that having given advance notice to the customer service manager it was our honeymoon we didnt even get a congratulations upon check in. Doesn't seem very personal for 4* plus but this is just my opinion based on other places we have stayed. Regardless, the hotel was a good 4* and location was fantastic for what we wanted. The club level lounge is just a basic room with a tea and coffee machine. We knew this when we booked. We took our own drinks up to the roof one night but was too cold to sit there for long. Again for 4* would have liked blankets or heater lamps to be available. All in all, would recommend and would stay again. ",2
48120,"Attended a conference nearby. Hotel is located in bussiness district, approx. 10 min walk from the nearest Metro station. Corporate nh hotel which was quite expensive, breakfast for €25 pp not worth the price. Tried it once but there are plenty of excellent eateries nearby that offer excellent breakfast for €7 or less. There are several nice bars at the back of the hotel, the hotel bar itself is really expensive compared to the other bars next door (think Aperol Spritz for €12 vs €5). All bars in this area close at 11.30 pm which we found surprising given the late dinner times. No option to have a drink afterwards. The rooftop pool is tiny. Would probably go for a cheaper hotel next time.",2
58744,We stayed one night here for a nearby theatre event.  Great staff.  Great rooms.  It's still our favourite Sydney hotel. The neighbourhood has lots of great eateries and drinkeries - but forget the pumphouse next door - tired and dirty bar/bistro.  That part doesn't live up to the quality of the rest of the hotel.,2
59589,"We spend 2 nights at Novotel Gajah Mada for family trip in Jakarta. Room is spacious, suitable for family. Would recommend higher floor facing the pool so you may enjoy Jakarta scenery. Gym& swimming pool is available. Restaurant is spacious with wide range of food selection, especially for breakfast.",2
42096,"This new hotel is nothing but full majestic luxury. Personalized check-in. Each floor has their ""butler"" and service level is very high. I asked for an iron and got it, although the staff was puzzled why I didnt use their laundry service instead (answer: I had only 30mins to get ready for business meet).   The room was amazing. Bed was large and soft and just perfect. So were pillows and linen. Very calm and quiet room.  Spacious. Luminous. Bathroom was big and elegant. My view was on a construction site, but this is the highest building in this city and Macau so surely some other rooms have beautiful views. This building is easily recognizable by night as it is the tallest and it has pulsating light show going all night. Easy directions with taxi.   It is far from everything though, so need taxi to go places. Not far from Macau ferry.   Breakfast was fantastic with nice views and good service. Dinner was good, but not mind blowing. Outside pool has a bar nearby which is ok and helpful. I used the inside pool which is very stylish and large. Next to pool there is a jacuzzi. There is a sauna and hammam in the changing rooms. Pool, changing rooms and sauna total luxury experience.   I went to the gym also. It is large, but only has some basic equipment and does not drizzle honey and luxury as all other parts of the hotel. Gym has lot of space and few equipment. Very few dumbbells and no bench press or other similar old school gym gear. Not the best gym I have seen.   Overall possibly the best hotel I ever stayed. Fantastic.",2
31463,"Nice, clean hotel. A bit pricey, but it’s right on the Magnificent Mile. Close to the Hop On Hop Off bus stop, which was super convenient. The biggest downside was that due to Covid, there was no room cleaning, no restaurant open, and no bar open. You could get clean towels by calling the front desk, but we stayed for 3 nights without being able to get our room cleaned. This was not indicated to us in anyway prior to our arrival. The complimentary internet was also hit or miss, which was inconvenient. The hotel was clean and convenient though",2
4466,"The location is interesting less than 10 minutes walk from BTS Asok and MRT. Located on soi 18, it remains quiet.  We booked a deluxe king studio and got room 318, a decent size, well equipped with kitchen.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows soft. Good professional and friendly welcome. The breakfast should be improved: very basic, no fried eggs, cheese, ham or fresh fruit. The air conditioning in the room seems old, difficult to adjust and really very noisy.  The value for money (a little less than 100 dollars per night) is average, at the same price you can get a more luxurious hotel in BKK but less well located.",2
58439,"We stayed a week at the Antica Appia Resort (“AAR”) and had a fabulous and wondrous time.  Prior to leaving for Rome’s Fiumicino Airport, AAR provided us with detailed transportation instructions and sightseeing suggestions.  As soon as we arrived (at 8:00 a.m.), Maurizio (owner) was there to greet us.  He had checked our flight and knew that it would be early, as did the high-end car service (Audi arriving and Mercedes departing) that AAR had arranged that brought us to and from the airport.  Maurizio spent an hour with us to show us all of the amenities of our suite and how everything worked.  It was well stocked with mineral water, sparkling water, eggs, prosciutto, bread, butter, Italian soda & Coca-Cola, cheese, crackers, cookies and wine.  Maurizio provided us with a list of recommended restaurants which turned out to be spot on.  As soon as Maurizio completed his introduction, we were introduced to Paola and she in turn went over all of the maps and lists that were in the suite and she also provided us with additional maps and information on where to go and how to get there and what tours to take.  We have never received such fantastic hospitality and service before, and it continued on a daily basis while we were there.  Irina cleaned our suite and made the bed everyday and restocked the refrigerator when we were low on drinks.  Whenever we had a question, we received an immediate answer.  The AAR is a gorgeous villa and it is set back from the road on extensive grounds.  It is protected by an electric gate and has a large parking area for cars.  There is a nice pond that is stocked with Koi fish.  The AAR is a boutique hotel with trendy suites that have been artfully renovated and decorated.  The floors and walls are very thick and it is amazingly peaceful and quiet.  It has the high style, look and luxury of an ambassador’s residence.  We have never received such exceptional value for cost, as well.  In the future, we will again travel to Rome and also visit Florence.  Of course, we will again stay at the Antica Appia Resort and highly recommend that anyone who has considered staying there, do so!",2
16855,"The hotel is difficult to rate, as it has some very strong and some very week points. First of all, it is located in the North of Osaka, fR from any point of interest. The walk to hotel from the closest station is through a bad area, a kind of Bourbon street. If you managed to get to the hotel, you are welcomed by an excellent team, determined to do all is needed to make your stay memorable. Now you think you are in... until you get to your room: the smallest you have seen and, guest what, with the smallest bathroom. Clean, but outdated, as if it had it’s best time about 15 years ago.",2
57141,This place is bit far from boat jetty and anywhere all place transportation they will pick up you to hotel so nothing to worry. I stayed 3Nights at this hotel and it was amazing. Food was delicious 😋 and WiFi is not bad and if you have more devices don’t forget to ask from them WiFi voucher for each your devices. I was planing to go to Nusa Penida and the hotel boat captain is really good guy and he arranged everything as I planed. I would recommend this place and I wish I will go this place again. ,2
2907,"We are here now. Lots of advantages but there are disadvantages as well. Lets start. Advantages:  •Food is delicious. The Space at the Food Festival is beautiful and well managed. Here I found the most dry papaya I have ever tried. For me food is the strongest point they have.  •They have an amazing fresh juice: carrot with apple is my favorite. •Territory is beautiful and easy to reach different points.  •Rooms are clean.   And now with disadvantages: •dinner starts at 7pm and from 4pm until 7pm they is nothing healthy to eat. For us is not a problem, but for the children might be. My son usually eats at 6pm and we have troubles to wait until 7pm •We were supposed to receive a room with mountain view, but received a room with of with of the balconies from the neibourhood hotel.  •rooms on L level are inconvinient for those who have children because the beautiful songs from the band are heard in the room and children can't sleep well. •beach is narrow. The wooden surface is not processed (smooth) and today a thin wood chip entered my sole •I believe there are not enough employees because the service is not their strong part. •for children there is only one small room to play. The beach is not kids friendly.   Generally the hotel is good for Adults only. It is not thought for family with kids. ",2
66649,"We were pleasantly surprised by the location of this hotel. Across the street is a Westfield Mall which as both indoor and outdoor shopping/dinning. Both locals and tourists can be found there. There is also a grocery store at this mall which made getting water and other supplies very easy. The metro station is 1.5 block away and only 15-20min from Placa Cataluna. The tram is also across the street. The hotel was clean and check in was efficient. The staff was always friendly and the door security staff always greeted everyone with a smile. We paid for the breakfast for our 6 night stay , it has a good variety of morning foods. The kids loved the pancake making machine and the sweet toppings. Mom and I loved the coffee machines as they ground whatever elixir of the gods you were craving to jump start your morning. The roof top pool/bar/restaurant was  great to have as Barcelona summers are HOT! The views up there are pretty nice. The wait staff on the roof were very interactive with the kids and adults alike. That same staff worked the restaurant/breakfast on the ground floor and always remembered us and would always have a conversation with the 4 of us. We were fortunate enough to have a room with both the Tower and Water view. I would recommend this Hotel to any family considering it as it's far enough away from the ""touristy feel/noise"" yet close enough to metro all over the city as we did. I would advise anyone staying here to consider the 2 or more day Metro pass since Barcelona has such a great public transportation system.  We used all public transportation there except the scooters only because we had small children.  I do wish the rooms were updated with USB charging outlets and or outlets with non European ones. With 4 iPads, 4 iPhones to charge, I had to do them in shifts.",2
13153,"Pros:   1. Amazing location just near tube line 2 which connects you to every airport, main hub stations and the whole of Seoul. There is also Lotte World Mall, Lotte World and a great Lake for running or taking a leisurely stroll around after work. As such shopping and food options nearby the hotel are fantastic. There is literally everything you could possible imagine to cater for all needs. There is also a theme park, ice rink, cinema, K-pop bar and aquarium within a two to five min walk underground in aircon.  2. The gym is good, has all the kit you need for a proper workout and is well maintained.  3. Spa and sauna are also great. 4. Room cleaning staff do a great job and keep the rooms clean. 5. The reception staff and concierge all speak English and are very helpful. I would recommend using the concierge for booking you a taxi as it can be a challenge using KakaoTaxi if you can’t type in Korean on your phone.  6. WiFi is ace, there is no password needed and the speed is quick enough to watch Netflix live without any buffering.  7. Weekly fruit bowl is a nice touch. 8. Shampoo, conditioner and body lotion are also really good quality. 10. Hairdryer and shaving kit also fit for purpose so if you forget to pack these items don’t worry.  9. Breakfast is pricey but the quality is great as is the selection of food.   Cons:  1. You can only visit the gym, pool and spa once a day. The pool area is a little dated and the gym can be busy in the mornings before work starts.  2. Whist you can get your haircut in the hotel it’s a little pricey. However it’s more of an experience; scissor cut only and hot towels etc. For a cheaper and clipper cut option try Juno hair in Lotte Mall.  3. The indoor golf option is a nice touch but it’s a driving range not an actual mini pitch and put golf course.  4. The standard rooms are dated and need an uplift. The suites are much more modern but also more expensive. 5. Air con in the room is very poor, it simply doesn’t get cold. This is compounded by rooms with a non Lotte Tower view as they get the sun all day.  6. No plug socket by the bed was annoying I had to buy an extension lead to charge my phone and plug it in by the TV. Also not all of these sockets by the TV worked.  7. They could do with more room storage to put clothes away. They are about one chest of draws short to put clothes in.  8. Not having any bright light in room can be annoying, at night it’s ok to function but it can be a bit dark if trying to work.  9. The window tint film was pealing off and was stained. They were also never cleaned externally.  10. The club lounge, whilst nicely appointed is expensive and very warm inside on a sunny day.   ",2
7952,"Had four wonderful nights at the hotel a couple weeks ago. Fantastic location, it's quiet and you can walk to pretty much everything. Lots of cafe's, restaurants on the I'sle. Rooms are a reasonable size for Paris, a place where rooms and bathrooms can be very small. Bedding was cozy, big shower with lots pressure and hot water. Front desk was a great help, the airport transfers are a big bonus. Recommend and will be returning.",2
54529,"The hotel is located at a convenient location and neighborhood. It is close to metro and about 12 min walk to Ueno Station (with luggage). The park and museums are nearby.  The room is clean and nice set up. We have a double bed and a Japanese style room with tatami.  The front desk service is good and helpful, too. We will definitely come back.",2
35271,"We usually write to the prospective hotels before booking them. We ask a simple question, such as if they can recommend any tours or if they have an elevator. If they don’t respond, we send them a second email, if they still don’t respond, we look for another place to stay. The reason we do this is to test the quality of their customer service beforehand.  Hotel Quai Voltaire responded to all our questions promptly and in a kind manner.  The hotel is in need of an update, we noticed that as soon as soon as we walked in.  The hallways are narrow and a bit shabby.  As soon as we reached our room,  we were happily surprised to see that it had a clean updated bathroom, the room though did not give us a wow feeling.  However, when we opened the window, we felt that we were exactly in the right place; we remembered one of the reasons why we wanted to go to Paris and exclaimed: Wow!   The view from the room is of the River Seine and the Louvre!    You cannot get a better view at this price! This is where one understands why the hotel cannot be updated:  it they were to renovate it, they would need to increase the rate in order to make back the money spent.  If they were to do this, people like us who travel on a budget, would not be able to afford this hotel and would not benefit from the priceless view that it offers.  As you look out the window you get a true feeling of what the Parisian life is like.  You have the access to the best of both La Rive Gauche and La Rive Droite from this location.  It is a walking distance to the Louvre, of course, the Musée de l'Orangerie, the Musée d'Orsay,  Notre-Dame, Champs-Élysées,  etc.  You will find restaurants nearby as well.     The breakfast was fine (not great) and we didn’t experience any problems with the wi-fi either. Additionally, the two people we dealt with, Gerard and Bernard were very nice.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel simply because the view is incomparable.",2
49169,"The rooms are nice, clean, comfortable and spacious. The location is great. But if you need parking they only have 20 spots for $50 a night, unless you can snag one around the venue (hit and miss). The staff are annoyed by requests for assistance and act like the guests are putting them out. I was hosting an event there and they didn’t produce on things they committed to. Don’t come here for the customer service!",2
67028,"We had searched for quite a few hotels at Agoda & Booking for something that would fit our needs. We were keen on a safe (although SG is generally mentioned as safe everywhere) but we were still wanting to be sure. This one was a little beyond our budget but we decided on it after we read a recommendation on a blog.  Overall the experience was nice. We expected the room to be a little larger though. There were some minor issues with the first room that we got (our room was changed after we saw some bugs - they claimed it was ""just some ants"" that got attracted to the fruits) especially with the washroom, such as not enough slant on the floor of the shower area for the water to drain off, malfunctioning accent light on one side of the bed. But these were just minor issues and did not really put us off. The second rooms was better - although on the same floor, it had much nicer view than the earlier room.   We reached the hotel early in the day and were told by the lady at the desk that early check-in is paid while suggesting we'll not get a room before 2PM; guess she was having a bad day at work as the next lady (whom we didn't talk to for around an hour while waiting) told us that she'd see if it could be possible and gave one to us quickly. The next lady didn't mention anything about early check-in being paid... I wish we would have talked to the second lady in the first place (maybe then we wouldn't have missed out of stuff on our itinerary :) that we designed hoping we'd get early check-in. Also, the same same blog mentioned that the hotel gives early check-in without fuss).  Zhongshan mall has a bus stop so you'd virtually walk out of the back side of the hotel on to the bus stop. Nearest MRT station is a couple of bus stops away. There is a large store (Fair Price - much better prices than the 7Eleven on the ground floor) in the mall where you can shop for fruits and stuff.",2
16776,"Outside the hotel look old but when seeing the room and toilet -  wowww amazing !  Toilet and room are much biggger than the hotel in myeongdong.  Location is good, convenient and only take short time from and to airport.   At first we chose to say at high floor ie 8th floor but it takes time waiting so staff gave us the sixth floor instead.  This floor is much better ie more quiet, and not too crowded with lots of people as they may choose this floor.   Pool is nice and very clean. Good price for this hotel with pool except there’s nothing surrounded interesting for shopping.",2
60064,"I've given 3 stars because whilst we did have a good time (couple and a 3yr old) however there were a few things that really spoiled our experience and for that reason I would not return. The reviews definitely made my expectations far too high.    OK so the good points:  - food is really excellent the Asian night was particularly good (we didn't use the Al la Carte restaurant) but one of the best  -  staff are all exceptional, we both said we have never met such friendly and helpful staff. - the kids club lady (sorry cant remember her name) was wonderful and made our little one feel very welcome and special.  The not so great points: - you are dropped off around the corner from the hotel down the road and have to drag your stuff to find the entrance of the hotel which did not make for a great first impression. - rooms whilst its been re furbished its still feels very basic, the beds and pillows were ROCK hard. It took me 6 of our 7 days to work out how to use the aircon. We had to buy our own sugar because it wasn't replaced daily.  - the entertainment was none existent for children, the kids club was totally closed Saturdays & Sundays (never experience that before) and you could only put your child in for 1hr slots (even though there were at times only my child there) they had a 1/2hr mini disco in the evening which my LO loved but again was over in the blink of an eye.  The splash park doesn't turn on until 10am - goes off for lunch - and then only on until 4pm. Maybe improves as the season goes on but really a huge disappointment for us, basically a lot of waiting around for things... ",2
67024,"This is a fairly standard 4* hotel with swimming pool, there is nothing particularly special about the hotel. Location is OK and acts as a good base for exploring Singapore, with various food outlets nearby. Our arrival to the hotel was fine, with the reception team quickly getting us checked into the room. The room was somewhat small however acceptable as we wouldn’t be spending much time in there. Housekeeping were efficient and kept plenty of mineral water for us in the room. Check-out experience was good and Paramjit was especially helpful with assisting our luggage into the taxi to the airport. Altogether a pleasant experience however the hotel could add a little more service elegance to improve their reputation!",2
20559,"My husband and I, who do not speak Spanish, stayed two nights at Alexandra Barcelona Hotel as part of our three-week 50th anniversary trip. The hotel is perfectly situated in the Eixample district, and it's easy to walk to stores and cafés and coffee shops, and even the hop on hop off bus tours.   Every single employee that we spoke with was friendly and helpful, and they went out of their way to find out what we needed and to make recommendations from restaurants nearby that serve tapas to the nearest ATM machine, to where to get on a tour bus. One of them even scheduled us an early morning taxi pick up to take us to the airport, and then that morning handed us small 'picnic' bags of breakfast items to eat on the way. We loved them.  The bartender grew up in Barcelona near La Sagrada Familia and talks with enthusiasm about his love for the cathedral architecture.   Communication was never an issue for us at Alexandra Barcelona, and we were always treated like welcome guests.  The hotel, itself, is an older building with wonderful quirky decor. It is not modern; it is kind of fancy, with upgraded details - definitely a mixture of old and new. Our suite had plaster decorated ceilings, USB charging ports, Spanish tile floors, and a very modern bathroom with a walk-in shower. It was exactly representative of a very charming neighborhood.  ",2
24950,"We were visiting Istanbul for the first time, so wanted somewhere central, with friendly people, and a good base for exploring the city. We were not disappointed!    The White House is a small 'boutique' hotel in a quiet street. The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the main historic sights of Istanbul - just a few minutes walk from Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern and Topkapi Palace. There is also a tram stop close by and the metro is also easily accessible, so travelling to other areas of the city is very easy.  The hotel itself is very well-maintained and comfortable and the facilities very good. In particular the rooftop breakfast room and terrace are great, with a view across to Hagia Sophia. Coffee and tea are available here 24/7. The rooms we had were relatively small but very well laid out, with large, comfortable beds and good bathroom facilities.  One of the best features of the hotel is the warmth of the welcome and the friendliness and helpfulness of the owner and the staff - they made our stay in Istanbul a very relaxed and enjoyable experience - and made us very much at home.  I would recommend the White House highly. If you're visiting Istanbul for the first time it's an excellent option. ",2
22465,"Check-in was fast and staff were professional. Room was of great size, comparing to other hotels in Myeongdong. The decor of the room that we got was a little outdated, furniture looks a little worn out. But was fine, it didn’t affect us greatly. My aunt and uncle got a renovated room on another level, definitely looks more pleasant but a little smaller. Great location, with shopping mall beneath it and next to it. If you are into luxury shopping, definitely the most ideal place to stay. Just cross via underground, it will be Myeongdong main shopping area.",2
42334,"Great in location where business, commerce and and trade centre will be around this spot soon.  Comfortable room with pleasant view of Pearl River and RGB bridge colors at night.  Friendly and cooperative hotel staff along the stay. Had a good companion by their food presentation at The Feast and Sheraton Club. The chef and the F&B crew are simply rockin' and chillin' every guest needs.   I have been in Sheraton before in other places but this is the cream of the cream.  Regards, Faris @ Farsberg",2
21165,"This establishment was quite good.  Really more of a B&B (no real lobby/24 hour front desk, etc) but fantastic given the price. It's in a great location, about a 15-20 min walk to the main Termini station, 1.5-2 miles to most of the big historical sites in Rome (except the Vatican), in a safe neighborhood, and just around the corner from one of the best gelato places in town (La Romana).  Pros: good location, room was very clean and the Morrison staff was very helpful and friendly.   They really care about their guests experience while visiting and it shows.  The outside of the building looks a bit rough but Morrison's itself (inside) is clean and modern.  Cons: breakfast was not served onsite. You have to walk 2 blocks or so to a little place where the staff didn't really seem to like dealing with non-Italian speaking guests.  We fared well, but watched as employees got visibly upset with some guests who had problems communicating.  The WIFI is a bit spotty, and you are ""strictly forbidden,"" as a note on the wall of your bathroom warns, from washing any clothes.  ",2

27797,"After a very very long flight from London via Singapore we were shocked to be told that the tour company hadn't specified non-smoking room and we had to pay extra for non smoking room as all of these had been booked. We explained that in Europe its normal practice for hotels rooms to be non smoking. We had to phone London and it took some time to sort this out. It was most frustrating after we had travelled over 20 hours. My strong advice is that before booking please make sure you choose non smoking if you want this. Facilities in the room were excellent especially the free cell phone. It's walking distance to local subway station and there are many good cars and restaurants and McDonald. We didn't have breakfast so unable to comment. Thanks to all the staff for a pleasant and help given,",2
28932,"All the rooms at this side face the same crossing, with wonderful panoramic view,especially at night.  It's right by heart of Wangfujing 王府井, a traditional commercial center in Beijing. Very friendly service.  However the room service came with a moderate quality... I mean the cuisine. They have various choices of restaurants on site: Chinese, Cantonese, Italian.  And a Starbucks right down the hall.",2
13347,"Hotel staff are very accommodating most especially Jopet Cabaya, he exceeds expectations. Security is also very tight, they will do necessary checks beforw issuing another key card.   However, the rooms need to undergo renovation already. We stayed in a connecting room, 601 watercloset seat cover is broken and the outside our view is a broken slab that needs fixing.   Overall, our stay is good because of the wonderful staff. ",2
48978,"At the last minute, my family decided to spend three incredible nights at the Garden Hotel, GZ. Franco Io, the amazing GM, personally helped my family book a reservation and made our stay truly memorable during the Chinese spring festival. My husband and I were truly overjoyed at all of the beautiful amenities, kindness of the staff, and memories made, especially with our two boys (ages 6 and 3).   We were invited to a New Year’s Eve banquet, which was absolutely spectacular, with food beyond description. There was also an incredible flea market that was happening during our stay and our family, especially our boys, enjoyed the New Year’s Day lion dance that was absolutely phenomenal!  We felt so privileged and humbled to stay at the gardens during the new year festivities and found it to be such a memorable way to mark the year of the Tiger. Thank you so much Franco and Garden staff for making our stay one that we will never forget!",2

But it is a bit noisy, you can hear what someone is saying in the room next to you. Good location for china town and train station. Center of Khoa San road is a 20-30 min walk. Staff is correct but not super friendly. I had a good time. (Beds are hard) ",2
19484,"The hotel has a great and quiet location yet has close proximity to train station, restaurants and many major sights. The staff at the reception desk were extremely helpful and courteous. Great roof top bar with nice views. The room was clean and had a quiet air conditioner. The only thing is we wished the pillows were softer and fuller.",2
42633,"Set back a few blocks from Ocean Drive which depending on your needs can be a good thing so the noise from the nightlife does not effect your stay or a bad thing if you don't fancy a walk to get to the main area of South Beach.   Parking is available in the nearby streets with a parking permit from the property.   We stayed in room 8 a garden room away from the main house, it was very clean and cool. All white and silver decor  very stylish, fitted with probably the best efficient air con unit we have encountered.  Breakfast is served in the garden there is also indoor seating available, excellently presented and prepared by very friendly staff.  On checking in we were given excellent information about all things South Beach with places to visit and eat discussed.   In fact every member of staff we encountered were helpful and engaging.   The only thing that this place could benefit from if it had the space would be an outdoor pool however it does offer a jacuzzi in the garden and also provides beach towels and other beach accessories if needed.   The photograph of the frog was added just because he waited near our door for us to come in on a night which was a nice touch although not sure if all rooms come with one.  ",2
37736,this must have been my 50+ stay at the HP.  The staff is extremely friendly and supportive when I need something.  The Aire Bar on the 28th floor is a great place to hang out or have a business meeting although during the day the stereo is too loud at times when no one is in the Aire bar.  Breakfast is fine with many choices.  I highly recommend the HP.  It is also very close to the sky train.  Also many restaurants near by.,2
14578,"Location is very good, we stayed in a junior suite, spacious and well decorated. Bathroom also very good. Lot of places to hang cloths.

19151,"No doubt location is one of the best things about this hotel; the other being a North American hotel chain that caters to Anglophones in the heart of Paris. Merci beaucoup! Literally down the road from the amazing Arc de Triomphe, as well as the metro, if you head in the other direction, you’ll come across many neighborhood shops and a lovely little market.   The rooms are large enough by European standards, even if the decor is a little underwhelming. However the bathroom was delightfully spacious and well stocked with amenities. We were part of a tour group so a full breakfast was included in our rate and had a good offering of items. The croissants continually tasted like MORE! Actually, the entire bakery selection was amazing. Good job!  It’s not cheap, but was a quiet and comfortable place to return at the end of every busy day in the ever beautiful City of Light. ",2

Needs maintenance: Stains on the carpet. Toilet roll holder falling off the wall. Some of the provided dishes not clean. Stain on the decorative bed cushions.  Overall, sufficient for the stay, due to location, comfortable bed, limited noise from other guests, and a good rate.",2

56666,"Don't be put off by the (very cheap) price. The Barjeel is simply excellent. Don't get me wrong, I was expecting to have to pay upwards of £100 a night for somewhere with character in Dubai, or sell my soul and stay at a ""safe"" chain hotel, so when I saw the Barjeel I didn't believe the photos were right. I was wrong. It's brilliant.  The staff who work there are enormously helpful - the one problem you'll get is that taxi drivers don't know where it is yet, so at 1.30am when I was dumped in a deserted bus station the receptionist came and got me. The literally 250m from a Dubai Metro station - and around 20 minutes from the airport.  The room was lovely, dressed in a traditional style yet with good air conditioning. The way the place is designed however means the room stays relatively cool. My room looked out on a courtyard with a great place to lie down and relax after a day walking around the oven that is Dubai.  The mini-bar is well stocked and well-priced.  You lock your room using a quaint (yet sturdy) padlock - don't forget (as I did) to hand your key in otherwise they can't clean your room!  It comes with a free breakfast which was perfectly acceptable.  In a city that focuses on extravagance and splendour to find a hotel that captures a feel of traditional Dubai that is priced superbly is such a nice surprise. I can't recommend this place enough. Stay there. You won't be disappointed!",2

15968,"The good:   This hotel is nicely decorated, clean and upto date decor. Located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Walking distance to Union Square and Westfield Shopping Mall. Easy access to the Cable car Turnaround.   I really liked the lounge area located on the rooftop, where they served complimentary Coffee, Tea, and Hot Chocolate.   Staff was friendly and helpful when it came to looking for advice or recommendations of the area.  The Bad:  I was in room 601, which is the side of the hotel that is next to Mason street. The noise level was obnoxious and made it hard to get a goodnight sleep. This is mostly why I give 3 stars to this hotel.    I inquired with the front desk as to rather or not the middle of the hotel which would be further away from the streets that run alongside the hotel and they told me the 01 rooms were typically the quietest. I could not get an explanation as to why the middle rooms would be worse.   I hate to experience a room with a worse noise level since the outside street noise sounded like we were litterally sleeping on the street.  Honestly this will be a factor to consider on rather or not I want to ever stay hear again.",2
62343,"We loved this place. It suited our style having a feel and a look of an older time. It's situated ina very handy spot near the souks and Dubai museum. It's located in a heritage area of the city which is kept very clean and is quiet rather suprisingly. It's parent hotel, the Arabian Courtyard, is a couple of hundred of metres away opposite the museum. Finding it was a chaalenge for our taxi driver and when he rang the number he got the Arabian Courtyard which was confusing but we got there. The staff are great and let us leave our bags as we arrived before check-in which was 2pm! However check-out is late at 12pm so things balance here. The room was fine with the essential aircon (the low temp was 30 deg C), a big bathroom and all you need. There's 250MB of free WiFi which was a little slow but it worked. Our rate included breakfast and this was great. It is served in the open-to-air courtyard so it may be warm.   There's a 650m walk to the metro and then a few stops to the Burj Khalifa, etc. There's plenty of tour buses and very handy 24hour supermarkets too.  If you want something a little quaint and a bit different I would highly recommend this place.",2

The apartments have the views, while being away from the noise of Thira.

62027,The hotel was in a very central location for me and everything worked well. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom nice and spacious. They had a great gym with Techongym products. Internet was ok too but obviously you are restricted on WhatsApp and Internet searches and my gmail accounts did not work. I sorted that out by hot spotting over my UK o2 line on roaming. I was paying GBP 7.5 for 500 mb which was not bad. There was a slight smell of cigarette smoke in my room. Obviously a previous guest did not adhere to the non smoking policy of the hotel. Also worth to mention that we had a drink on the terrace and when the wind was in the wrong direction we could smell sewage from the river running next to the hotel. Despite these few issues I can highly recommend this hotel to any Beijing visitor!,2
16151,"Our family of four stayed three nights at My Guest Roma. Our room, with king bed and bunk beds was really comfortable, beautifully styled and perfectly maintained. My Guest Roma is an easy ride on the bus to Roma Termini and the tourist precinct where the Roman ruins are located. It is also an easy walk to the local metro station too. There are plenty of local restaurants within the local area and the most stupendous 24/7 supermarket with a brilliant gourmet selection of anything you care to choose (even a sushi bar!).  We would definitely recommend Stefano's kosher breakfast, which is generous, convenient and inexpensive not just for those reasons, but because Stefano, the world's most patient and helpful host, will make time to help you plan your trip and give you advice on transport, the best websites to book tours, etc. On check in he made us feel so welcome, spending a good deal of time marking the map of Rome the best places to visit/walk as well as a run down on the facilities in our family room. It was a truly pleasant and memorable stay and lived up to all the 5 star reviews we read on this site before booking.  On our departure, Stefano even suggested we ring him if we needed advice on any of the other places we were visiting. Truly personalised service. Thank you, Stefano! We'll tell everyone we know who's visiting Rome to stay at My Guest Roma.",2

My experience in getting to BCN was a trying one - my original flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues, and I was re-routed to another airlines with three connections, only to have that flight was delayed and be re-routed on another airline through Belgium.  Throughout the ordeal, I was able to maintain contact with Beatriz and still confirm my arrival.  I was afraid I may lose my reservation, but upon arriving, I received a hearty “You made it"" and my luggage was carried to my room.  Beatriz had provided me perfect directions on how to get from the airport to the hotel.    The guesthouse is located in a quiet neighborhood and close to the Barri de Gracia and Passeig de Gracia, only a couple of blocks from the Diagonal metro station and only a 20 minute walk to La Rambla.  My room (#6) was located beside the office and had a private bath.  The room was clean and quiet with a small safe, hair dryer, ceiling fan and ample plug-ins for re-charging your phone, computer, etc.  Tea and coffee were available at any time and a continental style breakfast was included.  There is a lovely, quiet terrace and wi-fi was free.  The staff provided me tips on where to go for dinner which were great.  They informed me that the Festa Major de Gracia street festival was taking place and I should check it out and was sure to find plenty of food and activities.  They were right!  The neighbourhood's streets were colorfully decorated, illuminated with lights, filled with people and there was a concert going on as well.  I found a great place to have tapas and Sangria and just enjoy people-watching.  The following morning, after sightseeing,  Beatriz provided me with all the information I needed in order to catch the bus to the port.  Beatriz and her staff made my stay a pleasant one and I would highly recommend the Blanc Guesthouse to anyone visiting Barcelona.",2
57247,"Very well located, near place St. augustin buses and Metro. Small but clean rooms, a few thing need refurb but nothing disturbing. Very quiet - tight window and not too much traffic. Polite professional service at all hours. Will stay again.  ",2
7896,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel, it was very beautiful and great service provided by Cindy Chen, I would very highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting the Shenzhen area. It is also close to the huaqiangbei electronics market.",2
34899,"The hotel is located in an excellent location, especially for exploring the older part of the city and for access to the cruise port.  The service was good and the room was clean, only negative was a very squeaky toilet seat!! We found the half board menu limiting but the breakfast had a wide range of items to choose from.  We didn't use the pool because we wanted to see the city but it looked very pleasant and had a nice bar (non alcoholic drinks only).",2
37990,"I almost never leave reviews. The folks at this hotel were outstanding. We came down to visit my dying mother-in-law one weekend. Came back the next for the funeral. They were caring, considerate and gave us a bereavement rate, which was an amazing touch given that we only stayed there one other time ever before.  Outstanding breakfast and great service all weekend both weekends. Can’t wait to come back during happier times .",2
67380,"Pros: Unique property; convenient location; stylish renovated rooms and bathrooms; comfy beds; two Diamond-level upgrades in two visits (but only upon request); friendly staff including visible security; very good gym; decent in-house restaurant.  Cons: Long-running exterior façade renovation; had to request upgrades both times; gym closes early (9pm); restaurant wouldn't allow me to swap toast for a bagel, had to buy the bagel too.",2
16598,"Nice hotel. Good location, walking distance of everything Friendly staff. Pool/bar area was fantastic good food and excellent bar tender.  Room was very clean but needs a LOT of updating. Lots of Japanese influenced decor very outdated. Hilton has recently purchased this facility and I hope will  update.    Returned to hotel about 11:30 pm, inquired about a cold beverage or snack and was told there is none. Not even a vending machine.  Would’ve had to go to a neighboring hotel.   Would consider return after Hilton fully takes over",2
49893,"This little hotel is in a great location. Literally feet from the Lombard Gate entrance to the Presidio. We could also walk down Lyon St and cross over to the Palace of Fine Arts with no trouble at all. If you walk through the outside of the POFA, you can easily make your way to the bay and sit and watch the sunset and see the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Hotel was quiet and in a safe location. The staff was incredible. We got in late and had an issue with our bank card alerting to suspicious activity bc we were out of state but instead of kicking us out, they charged what the card would allow and did the balance in the morning. They were kind, helpful, amazing people. They told us about small spots around SF that we as tourists would otherwise not know about. They always had smiles on their faces and they even have a dog! She was well behaved and lovely. I really recommend this place. 10 out of 10 would visit again  Ashley, Richard, Bernadette, and Geno from CT",2
38884,"We choose Prekas for our honeymoon stay in Santorini in September. For our room we choose the Captain's Suite. While a little more pricey this recently renovated room is lovely and well worth it. It also includes an in unit jacuzzi and a private balcony at the highest level with a gorgeous view of the island (see pic). The views from Prekas were fantastic. The receptionist/day-to-day manager Chryssa was great providing us with a basic overview of the island on our first day with maps and suggestions. She also assisted us in booking a catamaran trip, which was one of the highlights of our stay. Breakfast was also provided quickly to the room or to the private balcony upon request and room service was excellent. While a little chilly (it was September) the pool was also great and was actually pretty refreshing after laying out in the sun for a while. Prekas is a little far (~30-45 mins) from Fira and a good hike from Oia but we preferred the quiet and the great views in Imerovigli and there are plenty of restaurants and a market close by. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely choose Prekas again!",2
37701,"The quietness of the outer circle of Prague combined with an excellent shuttleservice to nearest tram- and metrostation or zoo. Clean swimmingpool and we had a large familyroom for two adults en two kids, large tv and three windows with a view over the garden. With sauna, small whirlpool with music!, bowling, children playroom, good food and friendly service. Very good for families with kids.",2
44071,"I've stayed here before and loved it so I was so pleased this time around to see it's all been renovated. New beds, sofas, TVS. Everything new! The rooftop bar was great again, they've added new seasonal cocktails. I love that the staff are locals so they told us the newest and coolest cafes and restaurants to visit. 2 mins walk to the Metro and right under Acropolis. We slept 6 people in our apartment, you can't beat that value!",2
64566,"It was an enjoyable stay with a King Size Room and a comfortable bed. The room equipped a quite SMART TV, I could connect my Android Mobile Phone to the TV with a HDMI cable. Last but not least, I was grateful being offered a free-upgrade benefit from Queen Size Room to King Size Room.",2
27725,"From the pre-booking, Aloft was very accomodating in ensuring I get connecting rooms before I prepay the rooms.  I was travelling with my husband and 2 children aged 10 and 5.  We were very comfortable in 2 Aloft Rooms. One had a king sized bed and one with 2 single beds. There is no way we will fit in one room because they will not allow a rollaway bed. They can set up a tent/kid's bed on the floor but that will leave us with no room for our 2 luggages.  One of our rooms was an Accessible room so we didnt like to take a shower there so we all took a bath from the other bathroom but at least we had an extra toilet so we are more efficient in preparing every morning.   We had comfortable sleep because the bed was firm enough and we love the pillows.  The temperature in the room was also perfect.  We also love the toiletries and enough shelves, hangers and space for all our luggage and things.  The elevators can accomodate all occupants and we never waited a long time for an elevator to arrive.  Checkin was a breeze. I requested to have our rooms ready on the wee hours since we got a room even if we were arriving the next day. They kept our room until we arrive as planned.  Location is superb. Quiet enough to rest and near enough to get to the Myeongdong Shopping streets.   We wouldnt want to stay in the hotels right in the middle of the busy area because it will be too noisy.  Only drawback is there is no view. We got the back view with not so nice view but it wasnt so important to us.  We just opened the curtains when we wanted to check if it was sunny/cloudy.  Our stay was more than perfect.  From the helpful concierge (especially Gina being our favorite), to the friendly front desk, to the very accomodating chefs making our eggs at the Nook restaurant.  The hotel has all that we could ask for. The weighing scale at the lobby is also a good addition.  We admire hotels who think of this.",2
14357,宿泊以外では利用したことがありますが、 大阪梅田から近くないので宿泊はしたことがありませんでした。 バースデー祝いに、と宿泊しましたがさすがの老舗。 古いけれどサービスはきちんとしていました。  朝はバスで大阪駅まで。 タクシーでもワンメーター程で着きます。  Comfortable big hotel. It’s not near from Osaka station very much. But you can use shuttle bus from Osaka station to Hotel. Vice versa.,2
32512,"Nice family resort, we ate at azul, the tuna roll was delicious, in Sunset the cuban sandwich was great, and in casa de rosa aguachile rojo and chile relleno was delicious! Our waiter alfonso was great! I had a great massage at aura spa with Gabriel, he had just the right amount of pressure!!! Drinks could have been better as well as more food options and better quality ingredients. The wait to eat at some of the restaurants are a long time had to wait up until 9:30pm for some. I believe the resort is a little understaffed for the amount of occupants they have. Rooms are clean. The family camp was great for my 6yr old. Overall a good family resort!  Read less",2
53019,"Very Convenient, MTR can get Myeong-dong directly and just few minutes walking distance to the hotel.  Room services ok. Just the lift a little bit small.  For the breakfast, is not too worth as adults and kids same price.  And only one staff in the restaurant to perform reception, waitress and tidy things. Should hire more staff to help.",2
32670,"Stayed for five nights and was wowed by the price and Mike the owner/manager who provides access instructions before you arrive and was generally a great host, nothing was too much trouble, so use his local knowledge. Hotel is very close to Tsim sha Tsui station and the airport bus stops virtually outside. Rooms were usual smallish size for Hong Kong but has a decent size wall to wall comfy bed, TV and small private shower/toliet but note their is a 30/40cm step up from the bed area to the toilet area, so not suitable for disabled people.",2
17335,"I’m not one to rave about many things but I give credit where it is duly earned. On arrival, a lovely aroma swirls in the air from the lobby to the 24th floor. Despite the lengthy check-in due to COVID regulations, we were escorted to our rooms by very friendly staff readily waiting with a teddy bear for my little baby girl.   In the rooms... crisp white linens, well lit bathrooms, a panoramic view of the city and most importantly, all the amenities of a 5-star hotel. Not only was I delighted to see the play pen placed in the room for my baby, the welcome desserts and chocolates were delicious.   On the fourth floor, is where the breakfast buffet is held. The breakfast is always the reason we keep returning to this hotel, with a palate for western cuisine, it feels like a little slice of home right here in China. As a mom with a small baby, I always travel with the nanny, who is Chinese. This buffet is truly her favorite as she doesn’t have to endure through a lengthy mealtime filled with western cuisine that she has no desire for. The Asian selection of food is just as varied as the Western selection, best of both worlds.   Lastly, the in-room dining, which left a lot to be desired, was a bit of a let down. We had a rather unpleasant experience right after our meals, with several trips to the bathroom. This end with a trip to the hospital for my sister who was visiting from Shandong.   All in all, it was a pleasant stay as always.",2
34574,"While the staff at the hotel were very helpful, I couldn’t take in much of the city due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Had to cancel the day at the aquarium, wasn’t allowed on the beach, and overall a real disappointment!  I did have a lovely lunch at the Gaga Restaurant, and met some wonderful locals.  Definitely worth a trip back, post Covid!!",2
33604,"The location is great, just 5 mins walk from JR station. If you walk through exit from Retty (Department store) and go down to Tokyu store, it takes you 2 mins walk to the hotel entrance. The room is spacious and clean. I like staying here therefore after I checked out and had gone to Aomori for a couple of days then I re-book the hotel again in the same month.                                                                                                        Just one thing I would like to recommend to this hotel manager so that their service could be better. We have left a phone and eyeglasses in the safety box when we checked out in the morning, however when we go back to pick up our luggage at night, nobody aware that and give it back to us. Not until I go back to my city, we realised that the hotel has kept it up and we are still waiting the hotel to contact us so that we can get it back.  If the hotel take an initiative and give us our lost items when we go back to pick up our luggage, everything is much more better.",2
3892,"Really nice modern, clean hotel. Staff were helpful after we lost a suitcase at the airport. We got given water in the room everyday, selection for hot drinks. We also got slippers and soaps which was nice. My only complaints are it’s next to a busy road which can be quite load at night and in terms of transport to get you into the centre we found it really hard and ended up spending a lot of money on Ubers. Overall lovely hotel just wish it was more central ",2
25979,"Floridays Resort is definitely a budget friendly resort for families. The condo style rooms are nice for wanting to save money eating out as it has a full kitchen. Dining options are very limited at this resort but there are many restaurants around the area. Also included is  your own personal washer and dryer. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Pool area is ok. Not very secure and I wondered how many people using the pool actually were staying at the resort. The pool was never cleaned the 5 days we were there and there was a lot of debris at the bottom of the pool. All in all, if you are planning on going to the parks as a family, this resort is a good option. If you are vacationing as a couple, not going to the parks, I would probably find a different resort or hotel. ",2
62973,"What is good about this hotel: beautifully furnished with nearly every amentity in the rooms. Outstanding, obliging and fast service. Breakfasts to die for. Great location if you are arriving by train from the airport[s], as it is part of Tokyo Central Station - it even has its own private entrance from the Station. Located in the Marunouchi area, a good district for shopping and dining out. What it lacks: spacious and convenient public rooms. Handy public washrooms. The drawback: owing to its shape, running the length of the station, it is very long and accordingly you might have to walk as much as 150 metres to reach your room. You will have baggage service, but this could be a disadvantage for elderly people. Do not be put off by the fact that this hotel is on a Station - you will not be aware of the trains or any noise whatsoever!",2
2106,"It was our second hotel in Bali, and we were very pleased with this hotel. We stayed there for two nights.  The restaurant was delicious, and our room overlooked the rice fields. I hope you're not scared of lizards, we found at least two small ones in our room, and they can get a bit noisy during the night, but totally harmless.",2
51169,Over all the stay was good. I think the bathroom needs some sort of fan in it to circulate the air. The room was stuffy and smelt closed in due to the air not circulating. Even with the air conditioner on it did not help the stuffiness of the room.,2
1950,"First impression of hotel was good. Small room but workable for two of us. Front desk staff spoke great English and was helpful in providing assistance with luggage and directions to nearby parking garage. Parking cost 1500¥ for 24 hours (no in/out privileges) and was a 5 mins walk away. Lobby area had hot and cold drink dispensers that guests could help themselves to from 2pm to 11pm. Room was clean, modern and had almost everything you needed (and even those you did not).   All the good things went out the window when we tried to fill our empty bottles with the water that they provided at the lobby. The staff rushed to us and pointed out a small sign that said no filling of bottles allowed.   They don’t provide any water in rooms so you could drink the chlorinated tap water or buy water from the vending machines. Oh of course, you are welcome to take 10 paper cups of water from the dispenser but again, just make sure you don’t try to fill a bottle with the water!   Unfortunately this foiled the whole stay for us and we won’t be back.",2
43732,"We stayed here for a couple of nights in September, and it was one of the most memorable experiences. It's very close to the main attractions in Fira, as well as the bus stop which takes you to all other places on the island. Also many bike rentals available nearby, or via the hotel too.   The rooms were basic but comfortable and clean. And the free shuttles from the port or the airport are much appreciated. Although the best part would be the treatment received from the owners and staff. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and help you plan your days on the island.   We were offered coffee / wine on arrival, and our host (hate myself for forgetting his name) proactively explained every necessary detail to help us plan our two days. This was done individually for all guests on arrival. Maybe other places in Santorini do this, but I've never experienced this in any other hotel in the world.   It might not be a caldera facing 5 star resort, but at the price, we'd definitely recommend this place. ",2
11949,"The staff was friendly and helpful, the breakfast very good and varied. Regarding the room, it was clean and it had only basic stuff, no TV in the room.  The hotel is situated at the seaside, good for those who want to see the sunrise in the last moment :). The hotel also have a pool, not too big. I recommend this hotel for those who are not looking for luxury when it comes to accommodation.",2
3845,"Located just few miles from Ubud in a fantastic peaceful location of Tegalalang village this hotel was a dream location for us to see and feel true bali and its lifestyle away from Kuta and big hotels . I think we as much as we loved the hotel and location itself we have met such fantastic people that work in the hotel giving its full soul and harts to guests . We have been fortunate to meet families of some of staff and see how people live in Bali. Hotel itself was very clean , yes you have geckos on the sealing but hey this is Indonesia they are everywhere , Air conditioning wast A+ class keeping our villa cool all the time. Pool and its area was always tidy and what better view can you imagine than too look on the volcano from the pool in the middle of the forest. Alam Sari is a perfect location to set off on a trips to see Bali inside, all temples and historic places. We have spent amazing 2 weeks on our Honeymoon at Alam Sari and  with to Thank you all the staff and supporting people from village to make this stay so amazing. We will definitely be back once our little girl grow up :)",2

Their high party is excellent and lots of activities are planned for kids . When you enter you are greeted with traditional gestures . Then staff such as pavan , Ritesh , Jaideep , Manoj make sure to take care of every possibility to make your stay comfortable . Ritesh made sure to interact with every guest at high tea which itself had magic shows , tattoo , archery etc for kids . Then. Saravanan , Pratiksha and chef Sahoo were all exceptional at sea gull . Hari at the concierge is such a pleasant personality to interact to . Then Kannan and Debi were exceptional with their service at bay view restaurant . I am definitely visiting this place again .. too good",2
10482,"Stayed for 5 nights at the end of April in an Ocean Front King with Aqua Club. This was our 7th stay, and our first since 2020. We noticed a lot of the same things we've come to love at Live Aqua. The people are and always have been the star at LA. The Food/Drinks are also consistently excellent. The Aqua club was awesome and a great break from all the action. The cleanliness and overall resort upkeep is great, its easy to come back time and time again. The negative we noticed was a little more upsell than there ever used to be, and it's also time for some updates.  The pools and beach are overall a really great expierence but that brings me to my negatives. The Bail beds used to be free, and cabanas were an extra cost. The bed situation is a negative for us and many others we spoke too. Its confusing which ones are free (and there's only a few) many guest were repeatedly getting kicked out and asked to move. Because of this policy it only leaves the plastic pool chairs. These fill up by about 10 AM. Which brings me to my second point, the pool chairs are a little tired, its time to upgrade to some new chairs instead of the cheap plastic worn out ones. Some nice luxury padded chais would be great update.   Overall we still really love Live Aqua and we'll be back but its time for a little refresh in a few areas, and maybe slow down on the upsell. Special shout out to Guillermo in the Aqua Club and of course Marco, you guys are the best!",2
29598,"We really wanted an over water bungalow after our  Polynesian cruise, there was not a lot available & were lucky to find Manava had a few days, not as many as we would have liked though. From the street it is not very appealing looking but once you get inside it was awesome! Our room was gorgeous, large & nicely decorated w/ fresh flowers. We had a sun deck & a little platform for us to snorkel from. Special shout out to Vanessa @ reception for her kindness & attention & to all the women @ the desk who helped us get to Mass on Sunday.  I did not enjoy the weekend buffet breakfast, crazy long lines!",2
20977,"Well placed, close to the MTR. Good breakfast, clean, spacious room (by Hong Kong standards). The only downside is it has many unpleasant mainland Chinese visitors but then so does the whole of Hong Kong now.",2
67076,A decent hotel off Balestier road. Good facilities and adjoined to a mall. Smallish room (standard for the city and price-point I think) but okay for a short stay with the pull-out bed for an extra kid. The adjoining rooms made it easy to do with a family of 6 in total.,2
42461,"What a surprise! We originally planned on a meal at a different restaurant, tired and hungry from our travels we decided to dine with the first restaurant we found.

Each dish we were served being of 5 star quality.",2
41253,"For the most part The Confidante is a nice hotel but there are definitely flaws  The beach is beautiful with chairs umbrellas towels and great cabana boys who are super helpful as are the food servers Cons Everyone is allowed to play their own music so while trying to relax I’m listening to 4 different types of music  Many of the staff don’t speak English Luckily we do  When we checked out our bill was $xxx but the charge came through on my chase $200 more  I called the hotel they are like it’s a hold for incidentals I said I checked out everything was on my bill Today I see on my Chase it is the higher amount, I have now called Hyatt customer service dispute resolution as the hotel was no help and it takes 20 minutes to get a person to pick up the phone there  Seriously after a 3 day get away this issue has now become a hassle Therefore wouldn’t stay there again  ",2
43438,"We spent 4 days in Bangkok, then a little bit more than a week in Koh Tao, and then another day in Bangkok before flying out of Thailand. The first 4 days in Bangkok left us with mixed feelings after all the scams and dishonesty we experienced. So after that we weren't looking forward to that last day in Bangkok to be honest.  Luckily, we booked a room in the White Ivory B&B for that last night in BKK - we couldn't believe how honest, friendly, sweet, helpful, and courteous the staff was! They made us feel like being home. This was on top of the B&B itself being perfect! It offers everything you could wish for at a super high level of cleanliness and with an extreme attention to details (e.g. the dishes are hand-made, matching the 'white ivory' theme) and quality (e.g. the coffee and food).   More info:  The service, the rooms, the lobby, breakfast - everything for a very fair price!! The employees are extremely helpful (lending us money for the taxi, arranging a late check-out, hanging on to our backpacks after check,-out, providing shampoo and soap for taking a shower AFTER check-out to wash off the sweat from a long day in Bangkok and before a long flight back home) and super nice! The B&B is very close to a train station and there areis also a lot of local restaurants in the area. The fact that it's not downtown or close to the main attractions is a huge plus because you avoid the crazy tourist crowd but get to the attractions super easy and cheep by train.   Highly recommend this place!",2
16135,"Even before we arrived, our conscientious host arranged our transportation. Upon arrival, Stefano escorted us to our meticulously clean suite. He sat in ""our kitchen"" and explained all our touring options. He took as much time we needed to understand directions. The following morning Jenny prepared a delicious cappuccino and a nourishing breakfast .During our 5- 5-day stay, the staff kept our rooms and bathroom scrupulously clean.The hotel is in a central location to bus and train.We had fun traveling each day with the natives. In the evening, we ate delicious food at near-by eateries. We will certainly stay again on our next visit to Rome!",2

8590,"I stayed here for 8 nights. The hotel is situated on the coast a fair way from the Old Town and City centre - a taxi costs about 120TL each way (£6) The lobby and its marble floors are as spectacular as the hotel photos depict. However,  the furniture in the rooms could do with being updated. Having said that, the rooms and bathroom are very spacious.  All the staff were friendly and helpful - a special mention for Ali, a server in the dining room and pool area, who went out of his way to make my stay enjoyable.  The outdoor pool area is a good asset for the hotel. The food offered at breakfast was a wide variety of choice and of very high quantity. Food and drink at this hotel is very reasonably priced for the quality. Just 1 niggle - on one night a band played at the pool deck. Had I known in advance I would have been there promptly. Suggestion - why not have an Entertainment notice board to inform guests of the time/place of Entertainment to be provided. ",2

26381,The best part of this hotel is its location. Hotel is just above the Namba Station. Direct train access from Kansai Airport. Also a transportation hub to the surrounding area. Staff is helpful. Room amenities are like any other Japanese hotel of this class. ,2
5690,we stayed at the bourgas beach hotel for two weeks we enjoyed the stay . there was a lot of germans though only about 20 english so we felt a bit out of place around the pool. this did not discourage us to sunbathe there as it was a nice pool area and a stonesthrow to the beach which was lovely as you a the best of both worlds. the rooms were  basic but clean. the food was ok breakfast was edible but not much choice and the food on the evening was better. we would definatley stop there again.,2

The room was spacious, clean and we had a nice view.  The only thing I didn't get to try because we mostly ate out was the food, so I can't comment on that. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. Of course enjoyed a walk at the Arboretum in the mornings, and entry is free for Radisson guests.",2

39023,"Had a 10 day stay here with extended family, including a 9 and a 12 year old and it suited us just perfectly.  The apartment was very spacious, well laid out, and extremely clean. Great to have a well appointed kitchen and a washing machine for an extended stay. We had two bathrooms - both very nice and the beds were perhaps the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Another small but important point is the air conditioners.  They are modern, easy to use and controllable (unlike many hotels!) and there is one in each room to suit different preferences.  This is a busy hotel and lots of families stay here, so there are heaps of kids.  At one point I counted 20 of them in the pool (including my own!) so it is worth considering this if this isn't for you. My kids loved the pool and it was really handy for us that the pool area was next to the breakfast area - we could linger over breakfast while the kids swum.  The pool area was lovely - nice loungers, nice landscaping, and sunny in the morning and shaded in the heat of the afternoon, which was ideal. The small shallower spa type pool was suitable for littler kids and was very well utilised. Yes - the hotel is a 10 minute walk to Stevens MRT and longer to Orchard MRT but the shuttle is great if you can time it right, or alternatively the public buses drop you closer - these are easy to use.  The hotel is is a lovely, quiet residential part of Singapore so I found the 10 minute stroll to Orchard Road each morning for proper coffee very pleasant. Overall, it well located. Little things that would take this hotel to the next level.... Towels - No pool towels are provided and the hotel ones are allocated very strictly on a 'one each' policy.  So - if the kids swim several times a day the you'll never have a dry towel to shower with.  I think pool towels would be a small investment that would go a long way.   Front of house staff were pleasant enough, but not overly helpful.  Finally, Le Grove has a captive market here.  How about turning that infrequently used tennis court into a splash pad for the little ones and a cafe/bar for parents?  Based on your clientele, it would be a hit. All in all, Le Grove is a great find and I would definitely stay again.",2

At your arrival: they ask you about your trip to arrive there.  -	Complete silence at each floor, nevertheless the canal ‘Naviglio Grande’ with many bars and restaurants is only a five’minutes walk from the hotel. Due to the perfect sound insolation You won’t be disturbed in your sleep;  -	This is more than enough space in the room;   Don’t compare it with an eventually earlier experiences in France -	For your breakfast, You will first walk around the counter which seems to offer you endless possibilities to compose a healthy breakfast -	Meanwhile, one of the waitress (m/f) shall have p ut a cup of coffee at your table (which will  always be sanitized after your visit in the restaurant- -	The Vertgio-bar will really be a surplus to spend more than one day at nhow Milano. -	When I left the hotel very soon in the morning, I’ve had the possibility to grap some biscuits and an some fruit. So,  I keep in mind very good moments in this hotel! ",2
13549,"This place is all about the location...  Just south of the river, 5 minutes to the nearest tube station, 15 minutes from the Eiffel Tower, absolutely spot on.   The hotel itself is 3 star which is a fair assessment, but it is a strong 3 star. Clean rooms, well equipped, good showers and decent value for a city like Paris.  Overall if you are looking for a nice hotel in central Paris for a good price, this fits the bill..",2
22142,"It's our first time in Osaka with our 3 year old and it's a last minute trip. The hotel location is very convenient. The room is clean and compact, and decent size compared with the usual standards in Japan. There's still space after opening up our 2 suitcase on the floor. Breakfast is so-so, but that's ok as there's sooooo much to eat here. Staff is friendly esp. to my young kid.",2
40344,"My bf and I just returned from there. We stayed at this resort because it's near Chalong beach where our dive boats depart. We would recommend this if you are planning to dive or prefer quiet than party. It's away from the hustle and bustle, good service, good food and surrounded by nature, that is, mosquitoes, crickets, birds and cats haha! Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper! Room has soap bars, towels, tv with cable, good wi-fi, a small balconey, fan and aircon. We didn't like the shower because water was either cold or too hot, must be faulty. You'll have to walk to restaurant for hot water but it's ok coz it's a compact resort. Taxis are more expensive in Phuket than Bangkok. A cab to and fro Patong will cost you 1600baht and 30-40 minutes ride depending on traffic. There's no food nearby but the hotel food, reasonably priced and good can keep you satisfied for a few meals before you crave for something else. A cab to and fro Phuket Town where there are big shopping malls cost 800 baht. You can be adventurous and take a private motorcycle, operated by the motorbiker himself for 200 baht one way. My bf and i squeezed into one and was quite an experience. Overall we enjoyed our stay and paid a good rate.",2
29408,"The hostel is clean, the staff members are very friendly and there is a really nice vibe to the place in the evenings.   I traveled solo, and I found many friends very quickly in Yeah Hostel.  Unfortunately, there is no bar in the hostel, but they will give you drinks if you have dinner with them, there is also a shop across the road where you can buy alcohol to drink in the hostel.   The dinner is really nice, and it's also a really good way to meet people. The rooftop terrace is really nice with an amazing view of the mountains. Jake is a really good staff member going to exceptional lengths to keep everyone happy, he runs a good pub crawl!!",2
50558,"All hotel are great except lobby, you can smell cigarettes all over lobby this things make this hotel not worth to stay    It’s really annoying  Staff are great, facilities are best, even rooms & views are incredible but really this little issue in the lobby makes me hate this place",2

64522,I like the place very much. The price was decent and well located with a lot of restaurants abs bards close by. Be aware that has two access the first is in Cameron street abs behind is Granville but not well know. The behind part is the area where to can arrive by car. ,2
27219,"I was at this hotel when it first opened for business. I always like the Shangri-la brand, and I believe their management truly go the extra mile to show they value long-time customers like me. So when I saw the teething problems at this Shangri-la when it first started, I was somewhat taken aback and was reluctant to return to stay despite visiting Nanjing rather frequently, at least 2-3 times a year in fact.  This time round, my usual choice at the Xinjiekou area was booked out for the dates I was planning to be at Nanjing. So after some to-ing and fro-ing, I decided to give my favourite hotel brand's Nanjing outfit another try. And what a pleasant surprise I got this time round!  The main problem of the smell from the hotpot restaurant the last time I was here has been solved. The restaurant remains and is still serving the spice-filled Chongqing delicacy, but gone are the strong smells which permeated the entire building the last time I was here. The local staff told me that it all had to do with the ventilation system and they'd solved that soon after I raised the issue. Apparently I was just one of the many who raised it. Now you know your words do not fall on deaf ears.  Right, the location is also more ""exciting"" now with more shops within walking distance. There are convenience stores now, right off the corner of the metro station which is just next to the main entrance to this Shangri-la. In terms of location, I suppose the management of this hotel brand saw many things the rest of us could not see several years back.  But that really is not the best of it all. In any Shangri-la, I have always been impressed by the staff serving their guests, and some of these simply stand out. in the Fuzhou one, I have seen Alvin, Wade and Will going that extra mile to help me with some of the most absurd requests a guest can ever think of. In the new Hangzhou Shangri-la, the (now ex) concierge supervisor Jason must really be the gem of all gems in the Shangri-la crown. At the Yangzhou outfit, I simply adored Jim the concierge boy who had sadly left the hotel soon after my second stay. And in the old Pudong Shangri-la in Shanghai and the China World Hotel in Beijing, I am treated like a relative who has left home and ought to be showered with love and care each time I am back.   In Nanjing's Shangri-la, we have Will the truly smart, high IQ and high EQ concierge boy who is destined for greater things in life. Just see how he helped me with my courier requests and all, especially with the complicated payment (China does not use cash now!). I cannot praise him enough. And those whom I met at the front desk, who checked me in and out, were also exceptional and exemplary in their service levels.  The only qualm I have is the lack of similar enthusiasm among staff manning the Horizon Lounge on the 40th floor. Bordering on clueless and oftentimes disinterested, the management of this Nanjing Shangri-la needs to deploy better (read more intelligent, enthusiastic and confident) staff for this lounge. Just look at who mans the lounge at the Mid-town Shangri-la at Hangzhou, and the superb service of the lounge staff at the China World Hotel in Beijing. Learn from these colleagues of yours. After all, some of your most loyal and high-paying customers come to use this lounge; you don't want them to go away thinking that this is Shangri-la's latest service standards.  All in all, good work and a vast improvement. Keep it up, smooth out the rough corners and you're on your way to be some of the best in the Shangri-la stable.",2
6758,"Comfy, clean and safe place to rest your head.  Too old for backpackers but similar idea without sharing a room.  Bathroom and toilet facilities were suffice.  Lavender train station was in walking distance.  Very happy and all part of my plan to do Singapore on a budget😊",2
38463,"Despite being an Accor member, I had never stayed in an Ibis Styles hotel, so no comparisons with this level and brand. I booked it last minute, as we had a 7 hour daytime layover at Jakarta airport, with 2 different airlines, so had to go through customs and immigration. The upside is the proximity of the hotel to the airport - it was a quick 12 minute taxi ride from the airport to the hotel, and as other reviewers have noted, a much quicker return journey as it is on the ‘right’ side of the highway. The hotel is looking a bit worn, but there was an efficient check in and it was worth paying the approx $40 for a bed, a decent swimming pool (apart from the smokers around it) and a shower, before returning in 5 minutes for our departing flight.",2
49927,"Decent place in a convenient location for this visit. Free parking is always great. Free WiFi is too, but only when it works. In this case, it worked 1 out of 3 nights. Staff is friendly, room is fine, breakfast is little more than a gesture but there are good places nearby. Thin walls, poor water pressure (but hot, at least), nice pillows. Would probably stay here again for Outside Lands but not for other purposes in the city. ",2
2077,"Sideman is quiet and scenic ; you don't come here for the nightlife or excitement. However that's what we wanted and Sawah Indah delivered. We were just disappointed that when we wanted to extend our booking they were already full and couldn't accommodate us. It's built on a hill so if you are mobility (or night vision) challenged you may want to ask for a room closer to the top.  It's a nice place to just relax, catch up on work or reading if that's what you want, go for walks nearby, swim in the pool. We had supper and breakfast at the hotel. My crispy duck was good and the restaurant has nice ambiance. Breakfast has Indo and Western options, not amazing but very adequate. A nice place to stay and I would return (& book for longer ahead of time!)",2
25233,"Not far from the airport this hotel is well situated for that short lay over. It is handy to eateries but that can be true of anywhere in this city. The staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble. The down side is that the reception is on the 7th floor. No concierge and one has to find a trolley. These are situated near the entrance but at the top of a flight of stairs. Breakfast self serve is good but here the catering staff let down the standard set by reception, pushing past and standing in the way of guests. Singapore hotel prices continue to rise and are not generally good value. This hotel is more reasonable priced than most and usually includes a substantial breakfast. Rooms are well equipped and furnished. Key deposits are an unnecessary addition. Perhaps guests should ask for a hotel deposit if the hotel does not come up to expectation!",2
3235,"We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment. The location is convenient to everything...the beach, the park , Las Ramblas, the metro, even though everything is walkable. The apartment itself is spacious and has everything you will need to be self sufficient if you prefer. The staff at the office are wonderful...so helpful and cheerful! Would definitely stay here again and totally recommend it for others on their first visit to Barcelona. Thanks again, Paula! Pat and Susan Matthews.",2
56377,"Firstly, let me share my experience during vacation of 4nights with my friends.The hostel I stayed is located near Ratchathewi BTS Station.It’s a bit far from Central World.But I get satisfied with their service.What I like the most is powerful hairdryer,wide and clean bathroom.But for breakfast,I would prefer to have rice in the morning rather than just only breads with jam.For the place of aircon position,they should place aircon remove inside our room without keeping in ground floor of reception..We stayed at 3rd floor so that it is inconvenient to go up and down all the time.Although we called them to reduce temperature,they couldn’t come as soon as possible.These are little inconveniences but I would like to come again as their guests to see Pucci in the picture I mentioned😍",2
33423,"The staff at The Archer are top notch.  Hanh, Barbara and Kaleigh handled every change, request and question I had with ease, friendliness and professionalism.

I can't say enough good things about my experience.  The Archer is lucky to have all of them.",2
61056,Stayed a couple of nights here while visiting Austin. The hotel is nice overall. The room was fairly clean and quite. The pool was very cold and a Jacuzzi/hot tub would have been nice. The breakfast is not as good as it used to be.  COVID has them serving only cold food. You can heat it up in the microwave but I missed my waffles. Felt safe and comfortable with the location.,2
6548,"We stayed a total of five nights (at the start and end of our trip) and were welcomed warmly by the family and staff. Indeed, I would say the staff were certainly as friendly (and interesting) as any we have ever encountered. Breakfast was good and the location unbeatable. Our two rooms, one next door, were great and we especially enjoyed our terrace looking up at St Vitus. Only one small gripe - the hand held shower in our first room was a bit odd. Otherwise, we cannot recommend this place any more highly.",2
1617,"Having stayed at the Doubletree a few months ago, and needing another stay in London, I had a little single night here with the family last weekend. Me and the boy had something to do at the O2, so a hotel with parking (£15) a bit of a yomp from the cable cars was handy, and we weren't planning on staying in the room much, we just needed a bed and a bathroom, so Hampton was fine.   Then the wife and daughter decided they wanted to come, too, so we put another room on the booking, and as we were 2ad/2ch we got connecting rooms.  Everyone was quite happy, the Queen room of the two had a sofa, the guaranteed connection was a bonus and it was handy to have parking. the rooms were both well lit, although being at the side of the hotel we only had a view of the wall of the Moxy.  It's a long way from anything, though. We had dinner at the Fox just round the corner which was OK but not incredibly inspiring, and then the girls wanted to pick up some supplies for a hotel room picnic, but the nearest decent-sized convenience store was a Nisa the other side of Excel, pretty much opposite the ibis hotel. Quite a long walk for a 5 year old!  As for the boy and I, the cable cars had a 1 hour wait, so we'd have missed our show if I hadn't switched to the Jubilee Line, and they were closed by the time we left the O2 at 10, so that was no good for us either. Not the hotel's fault, but it's probably evidence that the location is maybe not as good as we'd have hoped.  Hotel was fine, staff were great, and the room was good. No noise from the airport or the roads, windows don't open. Temperature was correct and the bathroom had just a shower, but it was clean, hot and the toiletries in the pump dispensers were decent. The wife says there was a bit of noise from the corridor at about 9pm when the little-one was in bed, but not enough to be worrying about.  Breakfast was busy, but we had a table and there was plenty of choice for everyone.   They let me park until 3pm the next day, and told me if I overstayed (which I did) just to come into reception and they'd add on another couple of hours for free, which was good of them.  Happy to stay in the Docklands/Excel for London as I'm happy using the DLR and saving a few quid.",2
41804,"This hotel is located in Karangasem. Quite a remote area since we had to drive in a narrow alley. Too bad that all the restaurants nearby were closed due to the pandemic. But the hotel was amazing. Facing directly to the ocean, we stayed in a junior suite at ground floor and directly access to the pool as requested. We had so much time to relax enjoying the beach. The room was clean and tidy. They provided with many towels as well, which was very nice. The hotel had only one restaurant open during our stay there, but the food was nice. The pool was clean as the staff cleans it every morning. We saw them cleaning the pool every morning when we were having breakfast.   We did the reservation through WhatsApp and they responded very quickly. They were nicely enough to show us the other type of the rooms when we arrived just so we could compare the room that we were comfortable with. Thank you so much for the staffs!! Hopefully, this pandemic is over, so the hotel can operate normally. Would love to try the villas though because they looked very nice when we were walking around the property.",2
14330,"We were four people and stayed there for 5 nights. The room was pretty small but they changed it without extra money. The location was great, everything was around us.

57383,"First thing to note is that if you arrive after 20:00 you will be charged extra for late check in, even though the guy who checked us in was here anyway.  TV in the room was not working, and reception said that it can only be fixed in 3 days time... we would have left by then.  Some decency from house cleaning is expected - left my wash cloth on the sink as it was still wet from this mornings shower, came back to find it on the floor. They also didn’t leave enough clean towels.  Location is good, nothing else to say. Please note we didn’t pay pittance to stay here. Truly expected better.",2
40019,"Nice hotel, very clean, rooms a reasonable size and very clean. Staff were very polite & friendly.  Bar prices compare wel with bars. Buffet breakfast is a bit hit & miss, plenty of choise but when it's busy it seems to take a long time for things to be replenished. We had a room at front of hotel on the 2nd floor and were woken one morning at 5am by the bin men in the street.",2
53830,"This is a pretty average hotel--definitely not more than three stars. I say that because the rooms a a bit small and and the various floors and rooms could do with an upgrade and overall sprucing.  The lobby area is big and spacious--looks grand.  Checkin was easy although if you arrive before 14:00 they might not have a room ready.  Rooms are kind of smallish. Beds are comfortable and Thai solid. If you like very soft beds then Thailand is probably not for you. There's a safe in the room; a/c works great; and there's tea-making facilities.  Towels are a bit thin--in line with the need for an upgrade.  Food at the main restaurant and the cafe is very good. They have a sumptuous breakfast with western, Indian, and Thai selections. There are plenty of eating establishments nearby if you don't want to stay in house.  There's a nice big warm pool and a gym, including Thai boxing rings on the premises. The hotel is central to a lot of Bangkok sights.  If you want to get a bespoke suit or shirt there are several tailors' shops near the lobby.  All things considered, we had a pleasant stay.  ",2

It is in the Trasteverre area, surrounded by trattorias, art shops, gelato shops, pizzerias, food shops - all just a few steps outside your door. The area feels very safe and perfect for strolling to one of the small but excellent restaurants in the evening. The outdoor courtyard behind the reception area is a comfortable place for an afternoon glass of wine or breakfast. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our room was very comfortable, quiet, and impeccably clean, although small - but as expected in a large city. The breakfast was very good and abundant with meats, cheeses, eggs, fruits, yogurts, pastries. The one negative was the hard bed and hard pillows. I told the front desk about my problem with the hard mattress and they put a foam pad under the sheets which helped — a little.",2

The hotel grounds are beautiful with some great facilities, plenty of areas to relax around the pools that are well catered to by friendly staff. There's good food and if you want something different there is a shopping complex just across the road with massage, gift shopping and lots of restaurants. The only downside for me is the rooms and room decor is tired. Some of the amenities don't work and there's a lot of inconsistency with tv size, reception quality if that's important to you.  Internet wireless worked reasonably well throughout our stay (1 week). The staff are lovely, always friendly and attentive. Would I go again - yes, but I'd definitely look at some alternative modern facilities to compare with first.",2

We stayed on the 2nd floor, although served by lift, it was very small as it could only take one person and say two bags, but much better than dragging bags up a spiral staircase. Breakfast was a great selection in their basement restaurant, which had walls of stone and a heavy beamed ceiling. If you like history then this hotel has it all. A great location to Le Marais and we would definitely stay there again",2

3216,We had a two bedroom apartment. Large enough for a family of four and a very well appointed kitchen. Location was excellent and as usuall for central Barcelona there were plenty of places to eat within a short stroll.  It was a quiet apartment as there is no road at the front or back and there was almost no noise from the pedestrians.  Wifi download strength was excellent. The girls at inside Barcelona were very helpful.Remember this is not a hotel so they meet you at the apartment to let you in. Extra charges if outside normal hours . After midnight was a 40 euro surcharge. Fully airconditioned and light apartment Very clean.  The downsides ?; +Biggest issue was a very small hot water tank. They warn you that you only have 14 minutes of hot water for a shower. That is not long for four people ! It takes 2 hours to reheat the water again. + second biggest issue- the double bed was two beds put together. The bases were tied but the matresses were two singles and not able to be zipped together. Meaning you could fall between the matresses as they moved apart..  +No curtains in the Main bedroom- net curtains which gave privacy but would not block light. Fine in winter but in summer it would not provide a late morning sleep   +Lots of cable channels........ unfortunately all but the eleven news channels are in German- There is a DVD player so if you have english speaking kids take DVDs to amuse them if you were expecting the TV would do that + the shower is situated in the bath with a shower screen attached. Because of the way the bathroom is designed it is a narrow gap to get out of the shower because of the toilet. Could see an issue for the elderly or those not so able to safely get out of the bath.  Would i stay again ? absolutely even with the limited hot water.,2
18960,"I’ve stayed in this hotel various times 20 years ago, so planning our Greece trip- I knew this was the place I wanted to stay with my family.  The hotel is beautiful, great location and the rooftop restaurant views are exceptional.  My complaint is the pre arrival concierge.  I emailed them a month in advance various times to make dinner reservations for the celebration of my child’s 16th birthday & sightseeing options. Never received a response, until hours prior to our arrival after my husband emailed them. Upon check in, we were offered room temperature champagne, the excuse was that we were the last check in. Our suite was small with a broken coffee table, that was taken away and never replaced.   With that being said, our housekeeper was a charm, even though I don’t speak Greek and we could only communicate through smiles and gestures- she is a gem &  truly an asset to the hotel.  Upon request the concierge came through when I requested balloons & a cake in our room.",2
29108,"Amazing experience! The front desk staff makes you feel welcome, he escorted us to our room and made sure we needed everything to check in and get comfortable.  The room was the perfect size for 2 people - it came with two twin size beds, so my wife and I just pushed them together. Bathroom was beautiful and came with all the necessary amenities. Housekeeping gave us new bed-side chocolates every day, and they had great attention to detail. The room also had a Nespresso machine, so we made ourselves coffee and tea almost every day. The room rate comes with complimentary breakfast at the Restaurant attached to the main hotel! The breakfast's quality exceeded our expectations - there is much variety. Make your own waffle, fresh fruit, squeeze your own orange juice, cereal, eggs, sausage, ham, champagne, pastries... The location was perfect. The front desk offers free entry to the Charles Bridge tower - that was such a nice experience. It snowed on us our first night as we walked along the Bridge. So romantic!   We are very much looking forward to visiting Prague again, and we will stay at Hotel Pod Vezi again in the future.",2

39136,"I honestly don't know how anyone could have anything negative to say about this hotel- especially for the price! My husband and I had the luxury of staying here for two nights during our stay in Fira, Santorini. I'll review the room, breakfast, staff, and location in that order: Room: We stayed in a standard King bed room. It was perfect for two people, with a small balcony included. The plus to this room was the ample bathroom, and the fact that I got the see the most beautiful SUNRISE from our tiny balcony! I know Santorini is known for its sunsets, but have you seen the sunrise? WOW! Breakfast: Breakfast was buffet-style with your staples available- breads, cereals, pastries, juice, coffee, sausages, bacon, and eggs to order. We left each morning satiated. Staff: the ladies working the front desk as well as the cleaning staff were so accommodating. We received help with our port-to-hotel transfer, and were accommodated for our late check out. There is a gentlemen who sits at the front desk at night so safety is clearly important. Location: This hotel is situated walking distance to everything you could possibly need. 5 minute walk to Fira center, 10 minute walk to  the start trail from Fira to Oia, and 5 minute walk to the local bus station which provides transportation to the new Port, Oia, and other parts of Santorini.   If I ever visit Santorini again, I would love to stay here again!",2

The food is where it could have been a bit better, its an Asian restraunt, and its a little expensive, and its not traditional breakfast food. ",2
30705,"After three long years, we finally returned to Taiwan!  We were so excited to be back in our mother country.  We arrived at W Taipei at 8 am.  As we exited the van, two staff members greeted us with big smiles, ""Welcome back, long time no see!"" I was surprised that they remembered me from three years ago.  I couldn't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday!  Jason & James helped us with our luggage, and they greeted and chatted with us throughout our weeklong stay; that was very nice!  I'm not a picky traveler; I just need some minor details taken care of - a particular coffee machine, firm pillows, extra sheets, a quiet room, a high floor, and specific tea bags, and oh, did I mention a particular coffee machine?  Luckily, I had an ""Insider"" connection - Eve, who was able to take care of all of my requests.  She also arranged a one-day private tour to 九份, made several restaurant reservations, and gave us some pointers on the local food scene.  That was very nice also!  The trick to getting an ""insider"" connection is to reply to the email from WTaipei (not from Bonvoy) about one week before arrival, and you will be hooked into their ""Insider"" system.  We were often in and out of the hotel for sightseeing and night market hunting.  But we wanted to stay in the hotel for a couple of days.  We booked a window room at the Yen bar and met with friends around 5 pm.  The view of Yen Bar wowed all our friends!  Then we moved across to Yen restaurant (mildly drunk already) around 6:30 pm for dinner.  The duck was absolutely delicious, and the seafood soup (泡飯) was to die for.  But the craziest part was that the front desk manager of the Yen restaurant (T) also greeted me with ""Welcome back, long time no see.""  Hm…  I began to wonder whether W had a facial recognition system or if I just looked weird, but it was a nice touch; our friends thought we were VIPs!  Overall, we had a great week staying in W, and we can't wait to come back again.  Thank you, Eve, J & J, and T.  See you guys soon!",2
48144,"THE HOTEL RECEPTION staff Monserrat, Amy For all the help extended to us to keep us informed the maps and covid swab clinic , makes our stay comfortably easy. THE BREAKFAST BUFFET STAFF Karla, Rocio, Carolina and Sara For being so nice polite and attentive to our request every morning ( 5 days ) like our coffee . ALL in All , everyone here are very trained and versed and we had a pleasant stay here. For sure we will be back in your hotel . THANKS TO ALL OF YOU!",2
41593,This is our 8th trip the Greece and our go to hotel is the AVA in Athens. The staff and the location of the hotel are excellent. Close to the Acropolis and other major sites. The location of the hotel allows for walking around and easily returning to the hotel to drop off purchases or take a quick rest. The breakfast is very hearty and the rooms very clean. We have stayed at the AVA 5 times.,2
45606,"Very small hotel. The staff are what make this place. We needed to cancel our last night stay and they were most accommodating. The rooms are also small, but well formed and quie, with good double glazing. Nice breakfast was included in our price.",2
17635,"This place is excellent. Never been somewhere that will look after your luggage and let you use their facilities even after you check out for the whole day.  We were able to go and see the sights of sydney and come back at 6pm collect our luggage and go to the airport for our flight home. the location is great with easy walking distance to Circular Quay, Opera House, arbour Bridge, food places omg....  the new light rail system is almost at the door so travelling around the CBD so much easier.  best advice is to get into the pub or clubs early as these get full really quickly and you can wait awhile just to get in",2
14298,"We were there for two weeks for my wedding. I have accommodated all my guests and couldn't do load of my preparations without Mustafa's help.   Location-wise it is in centre, near Istiklal Ave and perfect for shopping and night outs.  I really enjoyed staying there and highly recommend it.",2
849,The room was super average. The bathroom had a really musty smell. The aircon made a very loud noise when using it. My friend also found some stains on her bedsheets. The breakfast is only cereal. It’s sad because the photos made it looks so nice. ,2
25254,One of the better value hotels in Singapore I always try to stay for a while when visiting.  The East coast proximity allows morning or evening walks. There is a basic breakfast included or you can simply go Toast Box next door or one of the eateries near by.  Dinner choices are many ! Only small problem is no MRT near by but many bus choices to and from downtown,2
53284,"Highly recommended! The place is very clean. Been receiving haircuts here for over a year. They take their time, is detailed and professional. Give them a try! You won’t be disappointed. However sometimes you have to book in advance. ",2
44868,"We have stayed at the hotel on five occasions now and it is clean and comfortable, but opt for a suite as they are worth the upgrade cost. The hotel is close to the both MRT green line at Asok,station, and the blue line at Sukhumvit station, so getting around Bangkok is easy.",2

41779,"We decided to get married in Bali and we could not have made a better choice for a venue and vacation. From my first correspondence until check-out after our stay we could not have asked for anything more.  Planning a wedding from 8500 miles away sounds like a daunting undertaking but Shinta made it a seamless and wonderful experience from beginning to end. She nailed it!  I could not have envisioned a more perfect wedding.   Now on to the resort and stay.  Our villa was absolutely beautiful.  From our private pool with beautiful landscaped grounds to a light and bright airy room we couldn't have been more comfortable. Every morning we were warmly greeted by the staff at breakfast and dined overlooking a peaceful beach. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the groundskeepers, severs, and clerical staff  were so gracious.  We treated ourselves to the spa almost every day of our stay and they were some of the best (and most reasonably priced) treatments we've every had.  We felt like royalty. We can't wait to celebrate our 1st anniversary at Candidasa Beach Resort!",2
30533,"Our first visit to Pullman Jakarta at Thamrin and was glad we selected this hotel.  Checking in at the Executive Lounge was done by Gilang and he did a wonderful job. We simply sat down and they made all the arrangements. Had a problem with payment but Giland settled it well.  Our booking was a Grand Deluxe Room but we were upgraded 2 levels up to Grand Exececutive Deluxe Suite due to our status. The room was large with a separate bedroom and ensuite toilet with free standing bathtub. The room looks exactly like those in the pictures on the hotel website. Amenities were provided for with a silk and cotton bathrobe.  In the bedroom there is a vanity table, sofa (stains can be seen, please take note) bedside table and TV. In the living room there is a sofa, TV, workdesk and a toilet for guests. You can close the door to the bedroom for privacy. Internet connection was strong and stable as we were given premium connection.  The Executive lounge serves breakfast to 10.30am or 11.00am in the weekends. Cocktails is from 6pm to 8pm. There is a selection of finger foods on display and you can also order from the menu for unlimited servings. On the first night it was not crowded and the service was good with ample food/snacks. On the second night it was absolutely packed and the finger food ran out. Menu items took much longer to arrive but you can see the staff trying their best. Reinforcements arrived and things got much better.  Had breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant and it was buffet style with a wide variety. Did not try other restaurants or room service.  Requested for and secured a late check out at the Lounge. it was handled by Sabrina and done efficiently. All of the staff in the Executive Lounge was polite and did their job well.  The hotel is located along a busy road and vehilce entry is to the rear. There is a walkway exit to the main road where you can cross over to Plaza Indonesia and to Grand Indonesia. It is not a sheltered walkway so it can be tricky in rainy weather. It was a light drizzle so we basically just walked over but umbrellas were not offered to us by the doorman/security.  In summary, Pullman Thamrin is a good business hotel to stay in. Bedding was comfortable, room was good, service was polite and food was fine. Will definitely stay again if in the area.",2
23600,"The location is perfect-- walkable to everything you'd want to see in Athens, on a cute square with great restaurants. Note that the rooms are VERY small (there was barely room for our suitcase because the bed takes up the whole space), although the balcony onto the square gives the room a more open feeling. The staff were eager to please, although our reservation was supposed to include a welcome bottle of wine that never arrived.",2
3331,"Check-in was smooth, handled by Mr Munish. We stayed in Executive’s suite which allow us access to the Executive lounge. The staff on duty was Ms Sifa and her service was exceptional. She was patient, attentive and accommodating to our needs. Well done and she is definitely for keeps. 👏🏼",2
15058,"Trip to Austin Texas, hotel was very clean and appointed as expected with a Hampton Inn. Staff very friendly and professional. Nice breakfast buffet and amenities. No issued with CHeck in or check out. A bit of a drive from the main airport but worth it.",2
61611,"Good for the price.. 2 pools one heats up after 12 ..  Bed a pillow and bit firm.. they have 2 single bed joined together and the bottom sheet only just makes it.. no top sheet . just a Duna with a cover.  Again too short and half way through the night it was off all sides Breakfast was quite good.. but mainly for asian taste.. rice, curry.. Gym small but done the job Service was excellent.. and always ready to help   TV was a good size and had 2 Australian ABC channels, 2 movie channels in english and 2 other news channels in english Overall still good ",2
54589," Been their 4 times, good hotel but this year it was  bit less,  still good but not super...  many employees where  not happy and could not smile  ( except animation was ok  but  had nothing to do for 6 years child), long faces  ..  food was good, not super and looked every day the same, also the thema evenings in the restaurant  we could not notice.   I hoped to be in advantice that 1 was special for being their 4 times, but noting, noteven a saying...   also outside of the hotel it looked  like abom  was dropped, dirty , no happy people on the boulavard and very expensive in the shops,,, i had a good holiday, but for me it was he last time their coming years...   tip for hotel, treaten the guest more special😉 ..  forme its a 7,5  point",2
6428,"This hotel do not have many amenities, but three items it had that were important to me, location, cleanness, and price, and Hotel Darcet hit all those items. Location is near to Metro, Moulin Rouge, Galeries Lafayett, and many cafes and restaurants. Also a bakery next door, and across the road is a large supermarket which was convenient. Getting to the main tourist points using the Metro or bus is very easy, and the staff was helpful, especially Ziane who was always at the main desk. When I checked in, we discovered I had booked for July instead of January, big mistake, fortunately Ziane was able to find me the last room for three nights, but found me another hotel for me mast night, so I was thankful. My room is very small and bare bones, but clean with white sheets etc. The shower had a door, I do not like when the shower/toilet has no separation and the entire bathroom gets wet. I was lucky to get a room with a small balcony, so was bright. The only negative issue, would be that they do not offer breakfast, there is a small room you can use to eat in if you brought in your own food, and a very small kitchen and fridge which was open to everyone, did not really like that. So the price was good for what you paid for.",2
54583,"This hotel has got so much potential but unfortunately there are a number of areas it underperforms in. The pools and slides are the one of best assets of the hotel, our children loved them.  The pool is cold but not cold for the size - fine when it’s a blistering hot day but do note this if you plan to travel early or late in the season.  The majority of guests are Russian, approx 90% and we found very little English spoken during the speaking sections of the evening entertainment programme. The entertainment was probably the worst factor of the holiday. When I complained, they said the entertainment don’t speak good English.  Food was ok, breakfast is largely continental in style. Evening meals are reasonable, our biggest challenge was trying to find a table for the four of us, despite being there in May we often found eating at 7:30pm (peak time) it was very hard to get a table. Our girls also struggled with the choices but donuts went down well for breakfast! The waiters are generally helpful and would clear a table for us as soon as someone had left but I found it disappointing having to stand around waiting on occasion. The Russian’s didn’t help as there are extremely rude and pushy.  Accommodation disappointing, family with two children and one child had a single bed, yet the other has what can only be described as a window seat with mattress. Cramped and strange. We asked to change rooms but told it would be an extra £50 a night so declined.  Staff work very hard, we were embarrassed at how rude some of the other guests were to them, we felt they were all doing their best and working hard (apart from the entertainment again where it lacked and focused on the Russian life style). The lifeguards were also friendly and fun.  Gardens are well maintained at the Limra and we liked that the cats are fed and cared for. The cats were are massive plus for us! We had a family of a mum and 2 kittens stay (sometimes 4 kittens) on our balcony all holiday. They were so loving and playful and clean!!  Lots of other things to do. Gym was good. Indoor pool was great. The bars were lacking I thought and the choices of alcohol for a 4 star hotel was poor.   We wouldn’t go back, overall we were disappointed and feel that the photos and tripadvisor reviews we read before booking are overly positive. We’ve enjoyed our holiday but there are certainly better hotels to visit.",2
28718,"I stayed here for three nights in a three person room with two friends. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They were knowledgeable about the city and best ways to get around. The hostel had a lovely atmosphere. There were shared bathrooms and shower rooms on each floor, all were very clean and I saw cleaners working around the building every day. The room wasn’t very big, especially considering it was for three travellers who would obviously have luggage. There also isn’t any elevator, which made bringing suitcases in and out a bit difficult. There was free breakfast every morning and free dinner three times a week. Also a lot of posters advertising social nights each night and trips the hostel staff could help you plan. I would stay here again for sure. ",2
27061,"My husband and I recently stayed for a week at this excellent hotel. Our room was a Camper City King with a sitting area and a small balcony overlooking a passageway. Although taxis and service vehicles use this street, it is primarily a pedestrian way. What made our stay especially wonderful was the consistently welcoming and helpful reception staff - a special thank you to Cayetano, Vitoria, Miriam, and Enzo.  We enjoyed the included breakfast buffet and the ability to order cooked items. After breakfast this area had self-serve items such as salads, sandwiches, fruit etc.  Making a cup of tea and having a snack after a long day walking around the city was a welcome respite. We have stayed at many hotels in Europe, and our experience at Casa Camper was among the very best. ",2
2681,"We had a pleasant stay at The Generator. The pupils’ rooms were basic and the breakfast was average, but overall it was satisfactory. The location is quite far from the center, but metro stations are near. Lots of shops and snack bars in the vicinity. Ideal for big groups.",2
48687,"Barcino147 is a lovely cool place and loads better than staying in a boring same-old chain hotel.  The place is beautiful and just in the perfect spot, not far from Sagrada Familia and Barri Gotic. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a few minutes.  I was a single traveller and actually stayed at the owner Ferran's apartment; the room there is massive and the decor and style are brilliant. Ferran and I discussed a bit of the history of Catalonia, the politics etc., but I stress he did not push this on me, I initiated discussions. On the day I was checking out I asked to leave my suitcase in the apartment. Ferran said this would be fine, but could he have the key to give to the new guests? He trusted me so much he gave me his personal key as he was going to be in all day, which also had his car key on it. He runs the place in this same personal, open and trusting way.",2
19013,"Very nice and clean hotel super close to the Milan Centrale trainstation. I stayed in 1-person-room which had a spacious bathroom and clean shower. Cleaning was every day. Breakfast was good enough, nothing special but you could choose from sweet and salty stuff. In an area where there are few restaurants and a subway station 4min-walk away. All in all everything you need.",2
7946,A key factor that we chose the hotel was wheelchair accessible facilities.  They did more than what we had expected by meeting our requests for my wife on a wheelchair to stay with peaceful and comfortable conditions.,2
48143,Room amenities and comfort was unbeatable. We had a king size bed and it really made a difference. The cleaning staff were super lovely and breakfast was world class. Plenty of staff to look after your needs to make you feel like at home. What really made the stay exceptional was the staff in this hotel. Thank you ,2
55411,"Just left this hotel after a short break here. Check in process was long with a queue to the front door of the hotel, took sometime to get through. When we did arrive at the front of the queue. the checkin process was quick, easy and efficient. We possibly arrived at a busy time. Arrived at the room and it was very clean and modern just on the small side. Air conditioning could be better but the cold drinks and crisps were a nice touch. Reception and bar area again very modern and drinks are reasonably priced. The pool area is great to catch a few rays. WiFi is not the best and continually dropped out or didn’t connect. Late check out is 40 euros which I find expensive, asked about a shower elsewhere and there isn’t one which I would have expected. Mmm what to say about the half board. Not good food is of low quality and it was FREEZING cold, although top tip there is a microwave if you want to food up your dinner.  Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes as it’s centrally placed and modern/clean but would stay room only. ",2
19047,"The hotel is on a quiet street corner, but within 5 minute walking distance of the central station, even closer to the airport shuttle bus stop. The bed is somewhat firm and could be a bit more comfortable.",2
37641,"Nice property in a quiet location. Helpful personnel and very convenient on request (!!!) shuttle from hotel to a nearest metro or tram station. Rooms, however, would need some attention – there are certain maintenance issues – at least the one stayed in.",2
34938,Even though a hotel delivers all the amenities it advertises its the staff their willingness and attitudes that complete a stay and makes it special. Our interaction with concierge guys Sheriff and another I forgot his name the receotion ladies Erin and Zahra even Saif with his tea. So obliging n helpful. Even the doorman Thomas so engaging. Our 4 night stay was so good we had to convince ourselves to leave the hotel to explore Doha. Wow Tivoli this hotel is the star of your group I'm sure.,2
15381,"We booked 5 different rooms for the whole family & stayed for 4 nights; a Small Double (14 Sqm), a Standard Double (17 Sqm), a Comfort Twin, a Musse Double and a Musse Twin Room. Check-in is at 3 PM only, we were charged additional; around JPY 2000 per hour, for checking-in early. Same goes if you check-out later than 12 PM. Receptionists were not that friendly and some staffs just does not know how to smile / speak politely.   Strategically located a bit away from main Ginza shopping district, 3-4 mins walk to the main Ginza Street. Above a 7-11, and surrounded by convenience stores; Lawson, Family Mart and Don Quijote. Good WIFI coverage all around the hotel ground. 5-10 mins walk to nearest train stations; Shimbashi JR Station and Ginza Subway Line.  Room:All rooms were spotlessly clean, serviced, new pyjamas everyday. The Standard Double room size is good enough for 2 pax and  to lay-open at least 2 big suitcases. Bathroom is separated; a WC room (complete with seat-warmer), and a Japanese Wet Room (complete with Hot Shower, Bath-tub and stool). There is a wash basin at TV and desk area. Really nice and convenient.   Breakfast: Breakfast buffet each morning with same limited choice of food but still tasty. Friendly staffs at the restaurant.  Overall, its a really nice small ""business / transit"" hotel, you'll enjoy it.",2
34351,"Centrally located. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance. Walking distance to the museum, aquarium, planetarium, beaches and if you would like a little exercise, the Navy pier. Another great Hilton hotel with absolutely amazing staff and get up early so you don’t miss a delicious hot breakfast. ",2
49015,Anyone with pics from the executive suits ? i was barely able to find some in their web-site as well as on any accommodation site. i will be staying there for a couple of months and would like to see how it looks like and what options it gives me. thanks!,2
32305,"Hotel is in a nice hillside location, quiet and away from all the noise of Kata and Karon, but only 5-10 mins away from the beach via taxi or hotel shuttle, which runs 6 x a day.  Accommodation:  I was in a sea view room, which was lovely. The rooms are modern and well looked after and had a bath with a window looking out into the room.   Service:  The staff are very helpful and polite and try their best to help with any request. The reception, cleaners, pool bar and restaurant staff were always happy to help me.  Food:  The breakfast is varied, but lacked a British / American option of eggs, bacon etc, however that’s understandable in another country where they have to accommodate so many nationalities. However the pancake’s were lovely, and they’ll cook an egg for you to order, plus there’s a selection of juices, cereals, pastries, plus Thai options.   Pool bar menu is simple and decent, with a variety of choices.  Drinks:  This is the only area I think could be improved on. Spirits are the same price as a cocktail and that doesn’t feel right. Also the cocktails could probably be better quality for the money, compared to the cocktails we had in bars and whilst out and about on our trip.  Overall: A great, quiet place to stay to recharge the batteries!",2
22882,The hotel was decent but the location isn’t very good. The Tor Sapienza train station might as well be abandoned. We knew the hotel wasn’t central but it was a lot tougher to reach than we expected. Off the beaten path for a reason.,2
60863,The hotel was close to where I needed to be at the time.  Easy walking distance to everything I needed.  It is compact. There is a lovely garden area in back with ample room to sit and enjoy the solitude during the day.  It is more lively at night.  You will have to walk up stairs to get to your room and carry your luggage.,2
48353,"For about AUD$70 a night, you really can’t go wrong with this hotel. Modern, clean and well maintained hotel (only about 4 years old) which is extremely well located in the Canggu area, only a few minutes walk to the beach, beach front restaurants/bars and other restaurants, cafes, shops and markets.  Rooms are basic but fresh, clean and modern with everything you need. Pool area was great, not heaps of sun beds though, and there was also a poolside cafe and bar though we didn’t get a chance to go there but the menu looked great. Staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful.   We were lucky enough to be on the top floor, level 6 which had an ocean view but also a view of the huge construction site next door, which operated from very early in the morning until late at night most days we were there - there was noise (mostly knocking/hammering etc not power tools when we were there) although the glass doors seemed to be quite soundproof. I’d have more of an issue with it if the room wasn’t so well priced. Bit of a shame as this new building will probably block the views and change the vibe of this hotel when it’s completed.   Buffet breakfast was average, recommend skipping this and trying out many of the amazing breaky and coffee spots around Canggu, which would likely be cheaper than the buffet anyway (about AUD$13 per person to add on if you didn’t book a room with breakfast). ",2
16643,"The Modern was a decent hotel at the marina of Waikiki. The room was clean, and had the simple amenities (mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave) We had a decent view of the pool and the ocean in the distance. Staff at the front desk was pleasant. Parking fee is high ($34.95 per night) It didn’t have any shops, but had a small restaurant with a limited menu. Only stayed there since it was part of our list from a timeshare…but NOT a timeshare as for amenities at all!",2
17091,"Having travelled all over SA I have not had a more personalised experience from being greeted at check in to the Head Chef coming to ask me what i would like prepared for dinner/breakfast. A vegetarian or vegan knows too well that most times we get the sides (creamed spinach and butternut) offered to us as a meal.Well not here there is a delightful vegan menu available and if you don’t like anything in it, the chefs are happy to oblige. My guests and I dined in the wine room and were treated to complimentary chef’s starters. The food was outstanding in presentation and taste.The estate is beautiful with manicured gardens and a chapel which is perfect for summer weddings. There is a conference centre and a spa offering day packages as well as other treatments. Whilst there I saw a couple picnic on the lawn so was tempted to look at their picnic basket offerings on the website. Just wished I had more time. I had the choice of the executive room or the luxury room. I chose the luxury room as it is more private. Fresh crisp white linen, comfy duvet and pillows , sufficient toiletries in the bathroom. There was nothing to complain about. I just simply loved my stay. You will be forgiven if you thought you were on a wine estate somewhere in the Cape as that’s the feeling you get when you arrive here.",2
51776,"PN is a serene little oasis oozing with artistic character, amidst the busy-ness of Bangkok.  The location is ideal for venturing on a canal tour, roaming old town Bangkok and markets, or getting to Khao-san Rd.  As soon as we arrived we felt so calm and peaceful, the hosts were incredibly welcoming and helpful (we arrived at 7am, our room wasn't ready but we were offered a shower, breakfast and a place to store our luggage until lunchtime).  Our room was amazing, so creatively decorated with ornate handpainted walls and hand crafted cushions etc.. artworks in themselves.  It was such a reprieve to return to our room, or to sit in the quiet of the downstairs open-air cafe, which felt like being in a little forest with butterflies, birds and all!  We'd welcome a return to Bangkok purely to stay at PN again.  ",2
7868,"I was here for three days at a conference so used the guest and business facilities. The building delivers a pretty bulletproof experience when it comes to meals, rooms and facilities. The hotel helped me arrange a minivan transfer from HK and there's a border crossing not far. The hotel is a five minute walk from a shopping mall but the immediate location is in an office type precinct. Always comforting to see a fire escape mask in the closet! Tip: Getting a cab to LoWu border crossing to return to HK was a bad idea as cab dropped me in no mans land late at night. Choose a more certain drop-off.",2

16587,"Great location and amenities (pool, restaurant, etc). The room was very spacious, bathroom was clean and also spacious, and the bed and pillows were comfortable. Concierge could be better when explaining tours available, didn't feel she was very energetic or friendly. The rooms facing the street have single pane windows, which allows a lot of street noise to come in. Also, the windows behind the TV were filthy, not sure they ever get cleaned.",2
52225,"Dear Hilton Manila,  The last time I stayed in a hotel in Manila was year 2007, so I believed that staying in your huge property will be something memorable.  Prior to my/our arrivals in your property, I had tons of communications with you thru emails and I would say each communication I had with you had been answered and noted thoroughly. I thought you have a well-dedicated team that deals with every emails and no wonder why it’s called the “Magic” (not a phone call person here).  Hilton Manila, we actually stayed in your property in two different occasions.  First occasion was when we just literally sleep in your property as a layover for our next flight. We arrived really really late from our flights from London via Doha and the hotel’s location from NAIA Terminal 3 and 2 was just so convenient.   As a HHonors Diamond member, you generously upgraded (complimentary) our rooms to your One Bed Room Premium Suite and the third room was a room with nice view of the pool. My own room was massive that even my kids wished we could have stay there longer as it was so elegant and cozy.   The next morning, we also experienced your Full Breakfast Buffet in Kusina Sea Kitchens located on the 3rd floor - and WOW… the breakfast food selections and the service were mind blowing. Before that, I also passed by in your Executive Lounge located on the 5th floor to have a look what’s the offer but still chose to experience the breakfast downstairs. I had 3 rooms in our first stay and required to put a security deposit of P5000 per room for incidentals as per hotel’s policy. I opted to a cash deposit as I was worried about the length of the release of the pre-authorisation from our bank cards. The first stay was so amazing that I even forgot to claim back my P15,000 cash deposit during check-out, silly me. We were looking forward to come back in your property after our family trips in Coron & Boracay.   The second occasion we stayed in your beautiful hotel was personally bit hectic from my side. We had a total of 11 rooms booked in your property in span of 2 nights. I will be always thankful for your kindness upgrading some of our rooms. So thankful for accommodating my big group and following my requests and instructions down to its very fine details I mentioned from previous emails. Though there were little hiccups with my reservations, especially on my very own room, I didn’t let these to spoil my high spirits seeing my family relatives after 10 years of absence in the Philippines - at the end of the day, I know you did your best to accommodate us as great as you could.  I would also like to commend the team of Kusina Sea Kitchens who accommodate my big group on a busy Saturday dinner buffet and Sunday hectic breakfast buffet. It’s so nice to meet and chat with Jessica Chua (Outlet Manager) in person after a lengthy virtual communication thru email with her prior to our arrival. Jessica, thank you very much for your kindness and warm hospitality.  There were  also 3 people I would like to say my massive thanks for…   Kuya Kim from Kusina who dealt our party during dinner. Kuya Kim, thank you for serving us and making my younger family members happy with Kusina Teddy Bears. Really appreciate it and the way you and your colleagues handled us that evening. Though I literally didn’t eat much as I was so busy hosting this family reunion, all my family relatives enjoyed Kusina very much - from food to drinks and impeccable service.  Secondly, Kuya Jay Arr or Arr Jay from breakfast who dealt my group the next morning. Kuya Jay Arr, thank you for your very very long patience with us, I/we nearly broke your patience but your professionalism and dedication was top notch. Without you, maybe I will also lose my mind with my family relatives that morning and sorry for the Almond Flat Whites - I can’t let down my wife’s request.   Lastly, Kuya Jeffryl from Housekeeping. I know it’s not your fault with regards to the mishaps happened to my own room allocation - but somehow you managed to fix my own family room from 1011 to 1003 in a blink of an eye. I don’t watch Flash from DC comics but you’re skills and efficiency making our room ready in span of few minutes making it as brand new as it can be made my wife and my 2 impatient kids very happy.  (Just to be clear, the mishap I mentioned above had turned to be a blessing disguise. I can’t elaborate how but I always think that things happened for a reasons and with this occasion, for me, it was a blessing in disguise.)  Hilton Manila, it was an absolute pleasure, utterly feel at home and a very memorable stay. I really hope we could have stay longer. All my family relatives had nothing to say but good things about their experiences in your hotel. Now we’re back in London, my kids and my wife still talking about their lovely memories in your beautiful hotel, putting me pressure to go back in the near future.  All the very best Hilton Manila and looking forward to see you again and hopefully not after another decade.",2
63319,"Perfectly situated comfortable hotel serving an excellent breakfast facilitated by friendly, professional staff.  We had a room on the third floor. One complaint: it took up to fifteen minutes to get a decent flow of hot water: it is both inconvenient for the guests, a serious practical fault and a poor reflection on the hotel's environmental performance as thousands of litres must be wasted. I suggest that the Manager briefs his plumbing engineers to attend to this.",2
56599,"This place is all about the location. If you want the modern Dubai 5 stars Spa , this is not for you. If you want to experience the ""authentic"" Dubai from the past, you will love this place in a pedestrian area. It is very convenient to visit the old part / souks on both sides of the river.  They are getting ready for Expo 2020 and  the government is currently restoring many old buildings in the area. Midterm this will make this hotel even better, but you may look at construction in the area over the next months. We didn't hear any noise, so it was no issue for us.  We were very pleased with all of the staff including the waiters in the adjacent restaurant. Yes, the prices are a little higher than in the local eateries, but where can you sit in the evening on a roof all by yourself watching the boats go by  and have some tea and dinner.  Any smaller issues like internet down or electricity gone were fixed immediately.   We spent a week here and loved it.",2

54605,"Me and my husband have great holiday in lovey limak limra, everything was great, rooms are clean , entertainment team are so cool and funny , especially sepideh is so friendly , ibrahim usta and ilker in restaurant are so nice. In lykia bar saadet and mehmet are so helpful",3
18357,"The place is simmply beautiful and stylish, the rooms are clean and the breakfasts are delicous. Hosts are very welocming and friendly. Gianni was very helpful as for the best places to eat and visit. I recommend this place for people who value friendly, domestic atmosphere and want to stay in a friendly, quiet and safe neighbourhood.",3
63533,"This hotel is nothing short of amazing, but the first impression was with Andreas (host) who is the nicest, most welcoming person who greeted us with a smile and a torrent of information on how to get around and the best spots. My sister and I stayed here for our 30th Bday and this experience has definitely gone in our books as one of the best holidays. The view from the hotel is breathtaking and the breakfast was always fresh and fulfilling. The entire staff were exceptional and greeted us every morning and evening with a smile. The rooms were clean and minimalistic in design which was nice and we had a balcony which allowed us to have breakfast/dinner outside if we felt like staying in our room. The buses into the main part of Fira took no longer than 30 minutes and they were pretty much on time with the bus schedule, so it was easy to plan our trips and get around without spending a lot on taxis. I will definitely be making this a repeat holiday and place to stay in the future!",3
33088,"I was traveling for work, but brought my family with me. This was a perfect spot for us. We were downtown and close to business meetings I had and sight seeing, but farther away from the busiest part of the city. We stay in a room with two queen beds and it was HUGE, which was wonderful for two kids, all of our luggage and a stroller. The entire facility was very clean and the staff was friendly and accommodating. My 9 year old loved the indoor pool. I would definitely stay here again. ",3
26087,"Its difficult to know where to start as everything was ""Escalante"" I'll use the pictures below  as a point of reference. The Grill was joint 1st in our favorite places to eat. This is where we met 'Emmanuel and Chef 'Radhanies' as seen in pic number 1. Emmanuel stood out the most for me as he was very personable and friendly to the point where on occasions we planned our dinner around his schedule to be served by him. Chef Radhanies also in picture number 1, served the best evening meals at the Grill which made us eat there the most.    Pictures 2 and 3 are of the resident lifeguards / Superheroes, Both of which are irreplaceable and a credit to the hotel. No exaggeration I witnessed them save two sozzled swimmers lives. They also assist less abled bodied guest in  experiencing the sea safely.    Pictures 3 and 4 are of the couples massage room where they initialed our names in roses and one of the masseuse 'Yocasta' In few words was highly skilled and attentive to our focus points.   Picture 5 is of the 2/4 entertainment staff 'Blue Coffee' 'Mr Black' and 'Coca-Cola who brought the evenings to life and then some on a daily basis with different events daily. They always kept us informed as to what was up and coming and had us entertained with witty humor and charismatic energy.   Picture 6 is of 'Veranobel' Excellence club concierge and my beloved Mother. He was her top pick as he was attentive, had attention to detail, went above and beyond to meet her/our needs as well as tailoring to our specific needs with a bespoke touch. He made paying that bit much extra for excellence club worth every penny.   Picture 7 is of 'Arisyorky' Everyone's favorite person to help nurse a hangover first thing in the morning with delightfully made coffee. He would also satiate the needs of a ice-cream fiend be that my mother and partner 7-8 times daily (no exaggeration), there favorites being Rum and raisin and chocolate ice-cream which he always had ready and waiting for them. A1 service from this young man.   Picture 8 is of a delightful lady who offered by the pool service (excellence club) with a high standard and a kind smile.  we literally never had to get up for drinks. it was almost as if she could read our minds as to what we wanted and when.   Pictures 9/10/11/13 are of the Kitchen Staff. I could ramble on for days as to how much variety they offer, how great the chefs are at the omelets stand where they tailor your eggs/omelets (egg whites only please!), how staff remember your desired drinks and seating area and have it prepared before you sit and lastly the abundance of all the favorites so you'll never miss out on anything regardless of what time you eat. 'Griselda' always had our drinks ready and waiting before we sat. 'Domingo' operated at a high level of professionalism to orchestrate and manage our specific needs. And last but no means least 'Noemi' A kind smile goes a long way, especially first thing in the morning, she always had our seats ready and waiting which attributed to the kitchen being our favorite place to have breakfast.   The last staff member I want to mention is 'Hendrix' This man inspired me on a personal level, he was probably the hardest working staff member I observed despite having every reason not to be. His demeanor and attituded  towards work and life stole the hearts of me, my family and literally everyone in the hotel. This mans energy can cure a hangover in 10 seconds flat. He is a credit to society and will forever remain in our hearts, We will return to the hotel to see him again.   This is the 3rd excellence hotel I have visited, I plan to visit them all based on my experiences at each of them. If I were to compare hotels I would literally be splitting hairs so I wont. Each hotel I have visited thus far offers a different and exceptional experience. This hotel being more intermate as its smaller than DR El Carmen and Mexico Cancun. This allows staff to be more attentive and offer a bespoke experience to each guest. The negatives am going to touch on and are not worth mentioning  in detail as they are miniscule, I am only mentioning them to improve which is already a phenomenal Hotel. One being some of socket covers in the room falling off and not staying on properly, The chocolate ice cream running out frequently (for obvious reasons) and lastly a phenomenon which never occurred  until later on in our stay where a number of guests arrived in droves and started to reserved sunbeds early in the morning by leaving towels, hats and or books on them and buggering off for a number of hours and then returning later. We found this to be an annoyance as on occasions there were no sunbeds to use as hats and books were tanning when we wanted to be.   All in all From our room Cleaner 'Jose' To Management at the top and from the Entrance to the perimeter of the hotel every was Escalante!  Please see pictures below and read captions for more info.

51108,You may need to pin up the curtains if the window washers are on-site. Great hotel and staff. I would definitely stay here on my next visit.   The manager was very professional and helpful. He was ready to listen and solutions oriented. I really appreciated his willingness to resolve guest issues. ,3
50067,"From the moment we were picked up from the port, our luggage carried to our room, the friendly welcome then the breathtaking views each day has been paradise. Breakfast up on the top balcony overlooking the caldera is worth getting up for. Only a short stroll to restaurants and another walk along the cliff path between the hotels to the town on Thira. Bus stop only around the corner to take you into Thira as well. Supermarkets nearby. Different levels of steps to rooms but in groups so quite manageable. Even with a sore knee it was no problem. Our age group is mid 60's. Thank you for a truly memorable experience and wonderful hospitality. We stayed in a cave room. Wow.",3
16395,"I am used to areas around railway stations being a little on the down trodden side. This area near Milan Centrale is not like this. The hotel is about 100 metres from the station in a safe area.  The room was large, quiet and comfortable. It had all the amenities that you would need.  Breakfast was substantial, although the hot food was at best warm.  Other than the issue of the breakfast food I thought the hotel excellent and good value for money. I would be happy to return.",3
60598,"My daughter and I arrived late I Kelly was so sweet!! There is 2 parking lots. One is gated next to the hotel and was is fenced (I believe) she had the security guy check to see if there was a spot left in the gated lot so we didn’t have to lug our bags at 11 at night around the side of the hotel. She went above and beyond to make us comfortable and I really appreciated how concerned she was to make sure we felt safe and didn’t have to trod around Chicago at night. She also told us which which busses would take us to the places we wanted to go. Thank you Kelly for all of your help and for the parking spot.  You made us feel at ease and you made out stay wonderful!!  I definitely recommend this hotel. Clean, nice staff and spacious rooms.",3

1559,Stayed two nights for my sons 18th. We found it easy to get to too. Parked the car in the public car park opposite at 12.00 per 24 hours.  The staff all where very helpful.   Easy excess to London centre on the trains. We also us d the trains to go in to Stratford for dinner. ,3
18301,"This hotel did not disappoint! We had a beautiful room and it felt just how I imagined a Paris room to be. Loved the staff, and the convenience of the location of this hotel. We were so close to so many places. The staff was great. I don’t remember everyone’s name but I do remember Nathan because he went above and beyond help us. But all the staff were very nice and accommodating. If you need to figure out which way to go or around on the tube they will guide you! I would definitely stay here again when back in Paris",3
29451,"Myself and 2 friends stayed in a private room on the 1st floor for 3 nights. The room is quite large, with large, lockable drawers under the beds for storage and security. We had a private bathroom, which had great water pressure. Beds were extremely comfortable, it a little high up! We were on the same level as the common room, but did not experience any unreasonable noise. There is a lift, which is useful for bags. Staff were extremely helpful with everything, great food recommendations and easy to follow public transport instructions! There is breakfast for 3€ but we mostly went out. Easy walking distance to all sorts of food and public transport as well as attractions. Cool rooftop with pool! I would stay here again!!",3
33235,Stayed in the back garden outhouse during my stay. A warm welcome was had from all staff and all ameneties were more than adequate. A good variation of breakfast foodstuffs was provided. Room was tidy and comfortable. Only 3 minute walk to the beach and transport to the city. Ideal and very reasonably priced.,3
55027,"The perfect hotel for a  trip to Athens. Walking distance to all the sites worth seeing. A nice breakfast with an amazing view , if really I had to find something to say  to make it better I would suggest a more visible corner of gluten  and lactose free products as I did not see any but I also admit not asking for any.  Nice rooms and very kind staff.  We were extremely lucky and managed a few hours around the pool  with exceptional warm weather (considering it was the end of October)",3
25874,I loved everything about this B and B and CANNOT WAIT to go back again ASAP! Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful place! It is exactly what I needed…sitting in the hammock in the shade was the most relaxed and peaceful I’ve felt in years. This place is truly a gem.,3
65429,"Had fun staying at this lovely hotel with my husband and 2 kids. This small hotel has an excellent location, walking distance to Cat street, train station and a lot of shops but still tucked away from the main road which makes it a quiet and accessible hotel for the family. The service is amazing and staff can understand and speak good english. The rooms are quite small though but this is very common in japanese hotels so I didn’t really mind. Their onsen is also one of the best thing about this hotel where in guests can relax after a long day of going around tokyo. The free yonaki ramen every night is also a bonus! Only thing that needs improvement is the wifi speed, because it’s so slow we had to use our pocket wifi all throughout our stay here. But all in all this hotel is a great place to stay in Jingumae area.",3
30558,"Foods are great, very nice and various selection. The ambience is nice and calm. Good service from Pak Akim and Pak A’ap at Sana Sini Restaurant.  They are very friendly and helpful. Thank you for such experience...",3
44195,This is by far the best hotel experience we’ve ever had! Very nice rooms and a staff that really stands out. Our four day stay with this helpful staff (especially the concierge) really made this a memorable visit to NY. ,3
18306,"Exceptionally clean and well maintained; breakfast was tasty.  We had a wonderful stay here, the entire staff were accommodating and extremely friendly.  We would definitely return and stay there again.  Thank you Stephan for your charm and hospitality and we hope to see you again someday soon.  David and Tamara",3
5458,"I came for one day to this hotel.  The crew was very nice, always trying to assist, and especially with one problem I received huge help by Clive, the general manager of this hotel.  Room was clean. Food is OK. Attitude amazing. Gym is nice. Pool is nice. Great business center.  Highly recommend!",3
17214,"I had the chance to stay for two nights, to attend a conference held at the premises. And it is certainly a stylish hotel -perhaps too stylish, for its surroundings. The lobby area is imposing, the rooms are slick, spacious and well equipped, the breakfast quite good and the service effective -but it is not that suitable for a tourist visit. It is 5km off Milan’s “historical” centre -and even getting there from the airport (in case one wants to avoid the, approximately, 100 EUR taxi ride from Malpensa) is a challenge.  So, if your main interest is downtown area and you still opt for Radisson, you’d better check the well detailed transport guidelines present on their site. If, on the other hand, your business brings you to the northern part of the city, it is indeed a very good choice.",3
45437,"I have again enjoyed my stay at this lovely hotel. The. hotel is now 21 years old but there is little signs of tears and wears for it has been well maintained. The hotel's location makes it easy to get around the city and to travel from and to Kansai International Airport. If I may find anything that the hotel may need to improve in future renovation is to install USB charger on both sides of the bed. If a couple is sleeping on the bed, one of the couples would have to charge the phone overnight near the desk, instead of the bedside. ",3
53281,"I am keen to write my review for the holiday inn al qasr in riyadh, Friendly staff especially Saheed during the breakfast, clean kitchem and very welcomed staff Well recommended hotel in the heart of riyadh , ",3
45884,This was our third stay at Cow Hollow and all 3 have been good.  It’s a no frills place but run well and safely.  Free parking is a huge plus in San Francisco and there are so many places nearby to eat and drink.  Walking to the Wharf is not too far and Marina Green is just blocks away.  The rooms are clean and the staff are so nice and helpful.,3
39351,"Stayed here for 23 nights in March 2019 Great hotel, good location Rooms so comfy and clean On 8th floor with great views of Rushcutters bay Peaceful and quiet at night Great and handy the small facilities for making a snack Michael and Wendy on reception went out of their way to help with a couple of things. Nothing too much trouble. They are an asset to the hotel. Although we had heard a few negative comments about Kings Cross we liked the location. No problems at all there. Yes we would return again to the hotel. Well done to all of you and thank you for a lovely stay. Only one concern would have liked a slip mat in the shower-slippery in there when showering.",3

42045,"It was a perfect stay. Excellent experience in one of those boutique hotels in the heart of the city, only a couple of blocks from the Union square,  with a personal attention, excellent staff  and very clean rooms. We stayed on a Matisse floor. The whole hotel and the room were filled with wonderful artwork and special small details that made us feel like we have travelled to the southern region of France. Very sweet, unexpected and memorable. Also have to mention a perfect garage arrangement right across the street for a special $25 - compare that to the rest of the hotels around the corner that charge $70 for the car!  Overall - excellent stay highly recommended!",3
11437,"Much better than expected, the surfcomber is a beautiful hotel with a fantastic pool and pool staff, especially Kurt! I’d come back here in a second! Small, clean beautiful with wonderful service… ideal location (beachfront, a block from Lincoln Mall). Really a great place to spend a week.",3
65717,"Directly on the beach with a good choice of pools and restaurants. The food was exceptional, particularly breakfast. All the staff were helpful, friendly and provided a great service, the location is also good with a shopping area directly opposite the hotel and further eateries and bars within a few minutes walk.

26077,"Overall nice resort with great service and rooms. Pools close at 7 so if not into entertainment not a ton to do. Food was disappointing to me, drinks were excellent though. I don't regret going but would not go again.",3
17328,We stayed at this hotel between 12 and 15 of April 2013. One of the nicest hotels we stayed in lately. Very well positioned near the subway station. The rooms were clean and had plenty of day light and were large enough. The staff was friendly and showed us on a map the places worth visiting. Some might argue that the mattresses were too soft but we found them to be excellent.,3
48050,"We stayed at Cape Panwa for 2 weeks in February.  We stayed with friends.   We very nearly cancelled due to so many negative reviews.  However, lessons learnt, ignore reviews, and stick with your booking.   Yes, the hotel could do with some cosmetic updates.  Decking around pool, tiles on pool bottom and sides and cabanas. There was some work replacing damaged parts while we were there. However, it was safe and pool cleaned every day.  The only other negative was the price of the drinks.  They were higher than I've known before in Thailand hotels. Plus tax and service, so even more expensive.  We hardly brought any opting for 7-11 and local bars.   So to the good bit.  Our room was absolutely spotless.  Huge bed and so comfy with the best pillows. Lovely shower gel, etc. Fabulous view over the pool and the sea. Block C.  Mini bar (never used stupid prices)  Lovely heart on the bed and cakes for birthday and wedding anniversary 💕   The room was also very quiet. I've never heard noises from the nearby room. Slept well. Cleaned to a high standard every day.   Food. As we were full board with Tui. Again, I was apprehensive as much negativity about this.  Breakfast was fantastic. Eggs cooked to order lots of choices.   Lunch - 3 courses, lots of choices on set menu, everything we ate was fabulous.  Hot and so full of flavour, especially the Thai options. We ate mostly at Cafe Andaman and occasionally bamboo bar at the beach.  Dinner again coupons. Buffets were great . Once pork on bbq wasn't cooked properly, but that was only once. Steak buffet night was amazing.    Top of Reef al la cart was wonderful, beautiful presentation and lovely food. My favourite was panwa house Thai. Absolutely wonderful food.  Beach  Beautiful private beach. Comfy sunloungers. Busy, but we never had an issue getting a bed for all four of us. Never had an issue around the pool, but I got up at sunrise to swim most mornings. It's lovely to swim as the sun comes up with a pool to myself. Train to the beach is great as lots of steps   Cape Panwa is a lovely, quiet part of Phuket.  The walk to the seafront is a steep challenge but a great way to exercise.  Plus, you get to try bars and street food and massages.  Highly recommend 3 monkeys massage.  Went 3 x over the 2 weeks. Amazing treatments. Lovely and friendly too.  Sunset bar with Massod and Yulee is a must. Great burgers and the best welcome. Good beer, great prices, and the most sunsets such a chilled, friendly vibe.   The staff at the hotel were wonderful, especially Jennifer at breakfast. Plus, the amazing manager Issara. Issara was incredible when my husband became acutely unwell one morning. He was really sick and needed a Dr urgently.  Issara organised a driver to take us to Bangkok Phuket hospital.  She rang the hospital to ensure they knew we were on our way. (The hospital drs nurses were amazing too)  Upon our return, Issara made sure we were OK and offered a room closer to reception so my husband didn't have as far to walk.  We thanked her but It wasn't needed. She also ensured our meals were taken in our room via room service.   I can not thank Issara enough for her kindness, especially when I got upset in reception. She acted quickly so my husband got the urgent care he needed.  He has made a full recovery.   The grounds are beautiful, well-kept, and great birds and wildlife. Set on a beautiful hillside. This is a gem of spot in phuket quiet and away from the crowds.  Please take with a pinch of salt the negative reviews.  This is a beautiful hotel.  Amazing food stunning beach and wonderful staff.   I'd definitely return.   Thankyou for an amazing 2 weeks.",3
17855,"We booked 4 nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary in Milan. From the moment we arrived we were looked after so well by Walter at reception  , early check-in as our room was ready , coffee and great advice where to eat in the various areas in Milan. The hotel and our room were flawless , really impressed with the quality , a lovely personal touch from the hotel was the complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates to mark our anniversary , if you are planning a romantic break in Milan you should look to stay in Chateau Monfort , the hotel is only a 15 minute walk to Duomo so ideally located .",3

65188,"Have just returned back from a five nights stay at Hotel Cervantes by Happy Culture.. we booked a triple room so i believe that's the biggest room at the hotel, which had enough space for 2 adults, a 5 year old kid & a toddler to move around comfortably. The pro's:- - Very good location, just a couple of minutes away from Rome metro station, also pretty close to Europe & Leige stations, so ur actually very well connected to different metro lines & RER too. 4 stops away from Champs Elysees & only 3 stops from the Sacre Coeur. - The staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, very pleasant indeed (specially that one receptionist who comes from india who i unfortunately cant remember his name !) - They'll provide free umbrellas if its rainy, also free mineral water supply during happy hour at 6 pm i believe. Free lollipops and candies for the little kids which they were super happy with. - Clean, modern & just what you need for sleeping comfortably after a long exhausting day of sightseeing and shopping. - Carrefour just around the corner.  - Trustworthy housekeeping (see con's to know why)  Con's:- - Very poor wifi at the rooms (although pretty strong at the lobby area) - our safe box didn't work. We couldn't enter our password and it kept giving an error. We informed the reception and they promised to fix it next day. But Frankly speaking we were usually too excited in the mornings to get started with our program, and too exhausted at the end of the day to let someone inside to fix it. so we didn't bother to ask them for fixing it again. So cant really blame them for that. We left our passports and cash at the broken safebox, and i was super impressed with the honesty of the housekeeping.. thumbs up for choosing the right stuff.. but still it's not nice for a 4* hotel to leave safe boxes unmaintained.  - I read on previous reviews that some rooms had A/C problems.. luckily our A/C worked perfectly for the first 5 days, and only broke on the day of checkout... we were already just packing and leaving, so again we didnt make a fuss.. but seems that A/C needs maintenance too   IMPORTANT:- i read many reviews rating the hotel as noisy due to its location near Rome metro station, that some guests couldn't even sleep !!! I was a bit bothered with these reviews specially that i was traveling with my little daughters and i thought about changing the hotel at the last minute. But i am glad i didnt.. Please dont believe this.. the hotel is very quiet and we never heard railway noise (although our room faced the main street not the back)    All in all, i would fully recommend this hotel to anyone.. i work as a honeymoon specialized travel agent in Cairo, Egypt. And i will certainly book this hotel for couples too who wants to stay on a limited budget but still enjoy a comfortable clean hotel ",3
44307,"Excellent services from Staffs Opal, Nut and Chiw. Polite and well attentive with smiling face always though there were full customers. We will definitely visit again. Anyhow the place shall be cooler as it a bit warm inside.",3
60791,The staff at the reception are nice. Room size ok. Toilet and shower room both are clean! Overall this is the best 4 stars hotel with 5 stars service in HK except tooth brush!   One problem here! Why the system here need us to write more than 200 words? ,3
12608,"I stayed during MWC and loved the warm welcome, including a packet of ham and olive oil wrapped with a personal note! The bed was comfy, the room a good size and the bathroom very roomy. Everything seemed very recently redecorated and clean. Location wise, there are a couple of coffee shops and restaurants nearby and you're ten mins from the city's main shopping street. Sagrada Familia is close by but the old town is a 30 minute walk away. There is a metro station very close though! Really recommend this as an affordable option. ",3

62102,"I have always been staying at the Waldorf Beijing and this time, I broke out of my habbit and tried the newly opened Bulgari Hotel after already spent two nights at the Waldorf.  I am usually skeptical about new hotels so I only spent one night there in case I dont like it.  Fortunately, this turned out to be a very pleasant experience and the design is, needless to say, lived up to its brand.  The guest rooms are very comfortable and very detailed oriented, even the design of the toiletries are beautifully packaged, like a jewel box.  Services is amazing and staffs are friendly.  Unfortunately I only spent a night there and did not fully experience the whole hotel.  Definitely would go back and try it again.",3
14086,We visited with my family. My 8 year old loved the kids club and we decided to upgrade our room to a one bedroom suite as the rooms were better.  I can’t fault the service  or the  facilities at the hotel.  Themed dining was impressive.   Wish to thank the staff for all round amazing hospitality,3
15464,"The hotel was relatively new and modern. I stayed there with my girlfriend during May 2018 for 3 nights. The room was very clean and spacious. We had no trouble sleeping as the bed was very comfy and the area was quiet during the night. There are also several convenience stores located nearby which was a big plus for us as we like to go down for a late night snack.   The hotel staff were also friendly and always willing to cater to our requests. A special thanks for their effort in helping us to secure a booking at an omakase restaurant 1 day in advance. That meal made our trip to Tokyo even more memorable!   Overall, it was a truly pleasant experience and I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends if they are staying in Tokyo.",3
57037,Selected this from research and was glad we did!   Excellent Service - thank you Alla! - our room was beyond expectations.  The bar service and tapas - wonderful.  They were all so helpful.   Would HIGHLY recommend hotel - we would like to return someday.  Thank you H10 Casa Mimosa!,3
47292,"Green apartments exceeded our expectations. Great location close to Coloseum yet quiet. Don't let the entrance fool you as the apartments are located through a private courtyard around the back near an Indian restaurant. Once you go inside the private entrance to Green apartments you are in another world. Their own internal courtyard is lovely and the actual apartment is clean, quiet and a reasonable size. Adrea is also a very professional and lovely host",3
15892,"Throughly enjoyed this trip! The rooms were clean, staff attentive and kind, and the location was perfection! The club lounge was the best part, with the jacuzzi and eucalyptus face towels, and the view was amazing! I visited for my birthday and they gave me a bottle of champagne to celebrate! The only negative was never getting batteries for the TV remote, even after going down to the desk twice and being told maintenance was coming but never did. Otherwise, the stay was fantastic and I cant wait to come back! Highly recommend,  and will be visiting again before the end of the year! Thank you!",3
16335,"It's really and outstanding hotel for business purposes stays. The staffs were well mannered and the stay was pleasant.

I am extremely glad that I was able to exprience their hospitality.",3
56962,"Had a great stay, only one night wish it was more. The room was fantastic, a great size and we had a view of the hotel garden and the top of the Gaudi House. The breakfast was really nice, a selection of cold cuts, cereals, cakes etc plus you could order hot dishes which were cooked to order. We will definitely use this hotel again and any other H10 hotels elsewhere in the world.",3

29572,The Manava Resort has been so amazing! We’re only a few days into our stay and my wife and I have been treated like queens! They check in on us often and usually straighten up our room while we’re out doing a hotel scheduled activity. We’re staying in a premium over the water bungalow and it’s a wonderful experience! We love jumping off of our little dock into the water and snorkeling just outside our bungalow. The staff is very friendly as well and Benjamin the Beach Boy was especially helpful when we dropped something into the ocean from our deck! Everyone you see greets you and it is a very welcoming place. We highly recommend the Manava Resort!,3

The Tamarind have kindly let us move our dates again, they have been amazing giving us credit from 2019! We have stayed at The Tamarind before Covid and loved the resort, hope we will be back soon.",3
53115,"We loved our stay here. We didn't plan on it, but there is an Alchemist Museum and Bar/Restaurant on the lower floor. I don't believe they are affiliated with the hotel, but it was a fun place to visit for my pre-teen and teen kids. Rooms are spacious and clean, great decor. I would highly recommend to all families. ",3
12525,Stayed for 3 nights in October 2019. The room was pretty standard but most importantly very clean and was attended to each day by the cleaners. The hotel has a cool old school lift which added a bit of charm. Price was very competitive given the location which is excellent for exploring Barcelona. Enjoyed our stay at Hostal Martinval. ,3
14110,"Hotel is very impressive with lovely views over patong, however be aware it’s up a very steep hill but tut tuts or taxis help ! We felt our room was showing signs and f wear for a relatively expensive hotel especially the bathroom with grout missing and water not draining  That said other than that the room was fine We are in la gritta which was good but  a bit more expensive",3
23103,"All the other reviews about the nice rooms (ours reminded me of the Aloft hotels in the U.S.) and friendly, helpful staff are spot on.    In addition to lots of good local restaurants, there is a well-stocked grocery within a block and several small stores with good beer and wine selections nearby.  We came back to the hotel and enjoyed our adult beverages and snacks on the comfortable chaises on the hotel rooftop deck.    We should have asked for restaurant recommendations.  We ate at the nearby Gran Ruca on Carrer de Rogent because they had outdoor tables available.  Now I know why they had availability when other restaurants are full.  The service was fine but the food was mediocre at best.",3
43489,"Service excellent and everybody greets you when you walk in the public area, an old hotel but maintaining so well. recommend Chinese restaurant because the chef is so technique to cook such a good Chinese food.",3

8395,"Had a two night stay with my wife to celebrate her Birthday. It could no have gone better. The hotel is great. It is just the right size. Not to big or to small. The staff was wonderful, friendly, helpful and professional.  The rooms are modern and comfortable, the pool and lounges are great, and access to the beach is so easy. My wife enjoyed a message and facial, which was done very well. Our waitress for breakfast, Venessa was wonderful, happy, helpful, and with a winning smile. Jason the director of the car valets was a delight. Welcoming and super friendly. A great first impression when entering the hotel. The front desk people were also very welcoming and efficient. The pool attendant were also super helpful and always were there to help. We would certainly stay there again.",3
22439,"Perfectly located and nearby Myongdong area. Where you can find a lot of shops and restaurants. Also, the hotel is connected to Lotte department store to do shopping all day. Highly recommended once you ate in Seoul.",3
49536,"I stayed at the mandrion south beach for a bachelor party. Our server Chantal was our server and she was nothing but amazing. Great drinks; great service, she made sure we had the best time and showed our groom the best time. I’d highly recommend coming here and getting a cabana at the pool, request Chantal and you’ll have the best weekend. ",3
24465,"Milan Suite Hotel is great! Upon booking, I requested for a quiet and highest possible room - they granted my request. I also got some souvenirs and complimentary wine on the first day.  The staffs were all friendly and accommodating. the room and bathroom were clean and spacious. I ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil, i love it! The location is quite far from the city but it only  costed me 15 € from Central terminal station to the hotel.   I will definitely come back.",3

12226,"We stayed at Hotel Zoe for a week, and despite the fact that I am a native of San Francisco returning to visit friends and family, I was pleasantly surprised in many ways.  Transportation:  It is very near Pier 39, which I suggest you avoid EXCEPT to see the seals.  More importantly, it is within walking distance (though hilly) to North Beach and Chinatown (alternatively take the #8 or #30 bus), it is near the north end of the Powell-Mason cable car line, and it is wonderfully convenient to the Ferry Building, BART, and Market Street via the F Castro streetcar.  It is also very convenient to Golden Gate Bridge Bridge toll plaza, the Presidio, and the western side of the city via the #28 bus.  For you budget/adventure travelers, it is an hour from the San Francisco airport via BART and the F streetcar.  Food: The in-hotel restaurant is quite serviceable for breakfast and dinner, especially with the $20 per day discount.  However, for a spectacular morning crab benedict go to the Boudin bakery, just two blocks away.  Trader Joes is just a block away, and since the rooms come with a refrigerator, that is very convenient.  For bread: Boudin -  oh yes.  The hotel does not advertise microwave ovens, but we were able to borrow one.  Summary: Great place to stay, no matter where you are headed in SF.",3
48298,"The hotel was great and the staff was some of the friendliest people we have met while traveling.  Not only did the staff remember our name during our week stay, they also remembered the name of my daughter's stuffed animal.  The room was lovely, the food was very good and the pool was a great place to spend the afternoon.  It is close to surfing, which is the main reason we chose it.  It is about a half block from the beach, but I did not find the beaches very nice (lots of debris and trash) so my daughter and I spent the majority of the time at the pool, which my daughter loved.  There is a lot of construction in the surrounding area around the hotel but it did not interfere with our stay at all.  My only suggestion is that it would be great if the hotel had a golf cart that it could transport guests down to the beach.  It is not a far walk at all, but you are dodging lots of scooters and cars while trying not to step on the trash littered on the street so it would be challenging to do this with a small child or multiple children.  My daughter is old enough that she could walk unassisted but I could see how this would be very challenging with little ones.  Other than that, highly recommend! ",3
31713,"We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff . Especially Fatehma , Sara and Naseeb. They were all so friendly and welcoming . Thank you to making our stay the very best .

19909,Glen and Joan were absolutely sweet and tentative to our needs. We were welcomed by them in the front desk and they were able to help us get into our rooms effortlessly. Richard was really sweet to us as well. Everyone in the hotel made us feel at home after a long ride from Santa Barbara. I would highly recommend visiting this hotel and booking with either Joan or Glen.  The hotel itself is very nice and its also central to SF for tourists like myself. ,3
27472,"It was a momorable experience staying at Hyatt with my familiy. The facilities are somewhat getting older, it would be good to have a change to renovate them. Breakfast was excellent. thank you......!",3
11042,"What a great hotel - made extra special by their attentive staff who were so polite and worked extremely hard to ensure everyone enjoyed their stay. The reception and breakfast staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful. We had a continental breakfast with plenty of choice of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and breads - delicious.  The location was perfect for the tube, restaurants. supermarkets etc.  Fabulous stay - a credit to all staff who work there.   Thank you",3
36191,"We stayed here for 3 nights late January and were highly impressed. We were extremely satisfied at the staff service as we were relocated as soon as construction work next door caused noise in our room. Attention to detail by staff was great e.g. offering umbrellas when it rained, gave us a map as it was our first time in Paris. Swimming pool and sauna were an added bonus. Room was extremely comfortable and clean. Location was ideal- 10 minute walk to arc de triomphe, safe area, close to many amenities (approx 2 min walk from supermarket). Could not recommend this hotel enough. ",3
53160,"From before we arrived until we left everything was just perfect. Perfect service, perfect apartment, in a perfect location. We didn’t want to leave. So we can’t wait to come back. There were parties almost every day/evening in the garden inside the courtyard of the apartments or in the café garden next door, BUT they are quiet at 10 PM, so you always get a good night sleep. And the apartments seemed pretty sound proof and private.",3
772,"It’s the second time I visit this hotel while in Singapore and it always manages to impress me. Located not too far from Chinatown and the Civic District the establishment offers great value for money. The rooms are of a nice standard and there is a gorgeous see-through swimming pool. The staff is really amazing, they are more efficient and professional than many 5-star hotels I have stayed in the past. A special thanks goes to War, the bartender, who really provides an outstanding service and always puts a smile on my face. I wish more people would have the same attitude when it comes to serve people at the bar. I cannot praise him enough.",3
43117,"If you have the chance to be overlooking the Ocean, the view is truly stunning. Plus the room and its bathroom are extremely comfortable. Outstanding service throughout this hotel, well beyond what you would expect from a 5 star! anything you ask, be it in the lobby or in your room comes in a matter of minutes, always perfectly done. To be pointed out: Danny, an exceptional head concierge both charming and outstandingly efficient: amazing to see he still hasn't the golden keys (Clefs d'Or). Fantastic breakfast with an amazong choice both international and Indian along with a huge choice of perfectly fresh vegetable or fruit juices, made to your liking if you so wish. This greatly headed by a young and very good Maitre D. ",3
31541,"We stayed at Bali Bohemia Huts for 2 nights in late June.  The location was very convenient for visiting the Monkey Forest - there were even monkeys on the hotel property, but they didn't  bother us.  The restaurant gives a very nice breakfast with amazing fruit juice and their happy hour was quite nice.  We stayed in the Dream cottage, which was a 2 story, 2 bed unit.  It was very comfortable and felt like a tree house.  The only reason I would rate this place a 4 instead of a 5 was that there were hardly any pool chairs or towels.  It was very hot when we were in Ubud, and we did go in the pool, but found it difficult to lounge poolside due to the limited seating.  I would certainly stay there again!!",3
12188,"Room is very clean , spacious and comfortable . It is a very good Marriot quality . It is 10 mis away from airport so if you just want to stay near in the airport . This is the place .  Breakfast buffet is superb . Service is excellent , I like the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor too. Dim sum are to die for . ",3
59399,"Location of the hotel is excellent.  Room was always clean and comfortable, fitness room and bar were nice, but the staff was a real highlight.  Daniela in the restaurant was always friendly and customer service oriented to me and to all others with whom I saw her interact, and she was just the most prominent, to me, of a very professional staff, from the front desk to the bar to the cleaning team.",3

It is Clean and even has the Kitchen on every floor.",3

We particularly enjoyed our breakfasts — the food was truly outstanding. Care and thoughtfulness to the last detail. During our stay there was an issue with the hot water heater. The owner Jason was very up front and honest about it from the minute he discovered it. We really appreciated his candor and responsiveness. I recommend this hotel for a unique experience!",3
9019,"Cozy, charming apartment in a great neighborhood with shops, restaurants and museums. It was clean, quiet and had all the amenities needed.  We had a lemon tree and olive tree overhanging our small balcony. The staff was very friendly. We were only there for a brief stay, we would have liked to stay longer!",3
17341,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel, in no small part because of the kindness and helpfulness shown to us by Ms. Wang (Demi) and the hotel's customer-oriented team. Demi helped us with the check-in process (which takes a bit longer than normal in these covid-19 days) and made our kids happy with gifts of some stuffed animals. She also helped me get to the Nanjing Massacre Museum with some helpful maps and directions. Our hotel room was very clean and well designed, and the four of us were comfortable both while we were resting in the room and when we were sleeping. The breakfast buffet was delicious, and we all overate (the spouse and kids liked the waffle sticks, and I liked the fresh fruit). The hotel is apparently located on the former site of a Ming Dynasty palace (none of which remains), so some of the decor is related to that. There is not much of interest directly adjacent to the hotel, but the Xi'anmen Subway station is a short walk away. The swimming pool was also a great hit - it is ~35m long, so it was very good both for lap swimming and splashing around after long days of site-seeing. Parking was easy at this hotel with the help of Mr. Liu (Lebron).",3

35345,Nice hotel does need a few improvements hospitaly could be better however the hotel is in good condition  and plenty of security. How ever is far from major attraction's. If flying from SAW good to spend a night there before departing as only 10 mins away  ,3
31292,"This hotel is perfectly placed for exploring the city. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. If you are above 5ft 10 then you will need to pay extra for the other rooms that aren't at the top of the building due to sloping ceilings, lets face it the price is amazing so don't complain if they give you a budget room. That being said it wasn't an issue for us and the room was more than adequate for our needs. Breakfast was great everything you could want, just don't expect a full English as your in Prague.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Thank you to the lovely staff for a thoroughly enjoyable visit.",3
15523,"We spent almost two weeks in this hostel and it really exceeded our expectations. The staff was super friendly and helpful, they speak lots of languages.

62024,"The hotel is very close to the airport, but even so we felt very tired when we arrived.

4823,We are a group of  travellers of 13 person with young kids and senior citizens. All our rooms were well arranged on the same floor and near to each other on our arrival. There were some hiccups on the quarantine issues and the front desk manager was very helpful in assisting to resolve the matters. Special thanks to the two managers Mr Keith Fung and Ms Iris So for being so friendly and helpful in arranging our stay. We all had a great stay in this hotel and for sure we will come back to stay again during our next trip visiting to Hong Kong.,3
41820,"Why it was awesome?  We booked Candi beach at the early stage of covid-19 virus, as Bali did not have any outbreak yet, our stay at Ocean suite facing the ocean was amazing, the view and the sound of the waves were absolutely nice! Bali was safe from covid-19 ok.  we mostly stay in the resort and didn’t go out. The massage therapist wore mask for precaution which was helpful. The view was very nice. Manager (forgot his name) attended to our difficulties very well   There are 3 restaurants, price were okay  Rp 50,000-500,000   1. Italian restaurant (very very good English speaking staff, you need to walk there but inside resort) the staffs were so accommodating to cook the specific meals without dietary products   2. Biru restaurant (very bad English speaking staff), all the soup (we tried) and food there was not fresh at all. We still paid anyway   3. Main restaurant (very good service!) pumpkin soup & Tom yam soup very nice   Breakfast:  - they serve to your room, just place order before 9 pm the day before!! Wow!!!  - but what I don’t understand was we were not given the breakfast card serve to the room on 8 March, so we miss Out one day, when we asked, they said they only started the in room breakfast on 9 March, new policy implemented, so weird..... not sure true anot   Remember to ask for the hanging breakfast door card, you place order then u hang at your door.   Things to improve :   Staffs at resort not very fluent in English only the management leadership is good at English  I needed help for technical issues about the tap, she reply me “breakfast”? Lol...  they don’t understand English   Massage therapist makes me feel awkward, apparently you can bath there after massage but after bathing, the therapist just stand outside wait for you. I meant stand outside “scary” then wait for you. Outside the bathroom door.. eerie   Biru restaurant prawn and fish were not fresh, we still paid full price by the way, I think no customers or fewer customers visited there and so food wasn’t fresh.   Have issue with the tap not pushing out the water.   Breakfast: Not sure why staff needs to open all the lid when serve in room, and remove from tray , weird... they can just serve with the lid and tray as we are still sleeping, eating later, so it make sense with the lid on,   Room service cleaning: surprise to see our left over food not clean up still, strange",3
60979,"My wife and I weren't sure where to stay in Athens. We did extensive research and ultimately decided on AD Athens. We arrived at the hotel much earlier than anticipated. We were told our room wasn't ready yet, but we were able to go upstairs and have some breakfast on the deck overlooking the Acropolis. When our room was ready, we were pleasantly surprised that they upgraded our room. The room itself was very clean and modern. The hotel is just on the outskirts of Plaka. You can walk to all of the major attractions with no problem and come back to a quiet hotel. The hotel has plenty of restaurants and shops around it and is right next to the metro. The rooftop bar is very nice, but its hours of operation vary. They serve breakfast every morning and it is delicious. They even gave us a to-go container as we checked out as we had an early morning flight and were going to miss breakfast. We would stay at this hotel again.",3

We were so well looked after we didn’t want to leave.  Special mention to trainee Monica who was such a beautiful girl and her English is pretty good too.  She was very polite and provide us with great service, we even gave her some research to do on a building we could see from the club and the very next day she told us what it was, brilliant!  Christine was also wonderful and a very hard worker and would be great to work for,  we saw her everyday that we were there from morning until night what an asset to the company.

My room was enormous, well equipped, and had a lovely open balcony, which I didn't get to use because of the wildfire smoke.  The hotel feels clean, stylish and relaxed. There's not much frills but there's a nice complimentary breakfast and a connected restaurant (which I didn't visit). Check in staff were extremely helpful and friendly, room was cleaned promptly and well.  I would definitely stay here again",3

31565,"If you're looking for a super instagram-able accommodation this is your place! The rooms are stunning (I stayed in Heritage which has gorgeous 70s peacock chairs on the veranda and is a matter of steps from the pool) with exquisite attention to detail to conjure up the bohemian dream.  Not only visually beautiful, the staff were all very welcoming and helpful and the rooms/area clean and well maintained. Restaurant next door served some delicious food making it the perfect haven slightly set back from the busy Ubud main streets. Saying this, the location is very convenient to walk/scooter around the Ubud area if you wanted to.  The monkeys (from the neighbouring Sacred Monkey Forest) did make a couple of appearances whilst I was in the pool and having a massage but there was always at least one person on 'monkey watch' so never felt concerned or unsafe about their presence and they were very efficient at keeping them away!  Would 100% stay here again - thank you for such a great visit!",3
6467,"The hotel Darcet is a hidden gem. Tucked away on a narrow, almost hidden street, it is close to the Metro and many restaurants,cafes and convenience stores. Rooms are small, but very clean and comfortable. The reception staff are exceptionally helpful and welcoming. As with many older buildings the elevator is extremely small, but upon hearing my dislike of confined spaces, we were provided with a room on the first floor.  Free coffee and tea are provided as well as a common refrigerator and microwave to allow you to store and heat food you have purchased from any one of a number of nearby locations. I would definitely stay here again. ",3

We even got comped a private tequila tasting to compensate for a misunderstanding,3
32702,"My stay was for 2 weeks and it was an amazing experience due to ambiance, friendly and cooperative staff especially Mr Faizan, Breakfast, and appealing views from the hotel and thier efficient services. I would love to stay here again.",3
29857,"Spent 2 nights here before returning to US and loved it.  Great room looking at Parthenon, very good breakfast variety,  lovely rooftop with food drinks and view of Parthenon, great location.  Easy walk to everywhere",3
37511,Couldn’t fault this hotel except the chips that came out cold. Staff service was excellent.  Always knew you and asked how day was going. Bar service was spot on even around the pool  I certainly will be back ,3
13129,"Location was convenient to visit hot places and it is possible go walking around to shopping, to sight seen and other very nice attractions nearby the hotel. I was surprise to find the hotel conditon quite dated and facilites reminded me of a typical motel or Inn room in US. That was the only down point and it is really problem I think. But from the moment I walked in to check in, to the moment I checked out I felt welcomed. And all the staffs I met, they were reallyb friendly and helpful. Concierge is kind enough to offer me a lot of informations. What made this hotel special for me was the numbers of very helpful, smiling staff.",3
41300,"Great hotel with very close beach access (chairs, umbrellas, towels) and two pools, one for families and one for adults. This was very nice since we were traveling with our toddler, so having a designated pool was very convenient. The food in the hotel is delicious, but a bit expensive (on par with the Miami Beach area though). Good cocktails at the hotel bar. The front desk staff was very helpful and allowed us an extended check-out. I would definitely recommend this hotel ",3
51287,"We stayed here 3 nights, first two in the plaza suite and another night in the deluxe 101 view room. It’s worth to note that we traveled extensively both in the U.S. and abroad and have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this hotel has become one of our favorites. The hotel is centrally located, the rooms are top notch in decor and amenities. We specifically like the layout of the plaza suites. The food in the buffet is excellent.   The staff are courteous, professional as well as friendly and warm. My husband got a foot blister the first day in Taipei and needed shoe inserts. The concierge immediately found a nearby shop and called the taxi for us. We accidentally left the laptop charger after checking out and Ailin from the house keeping dept contacted us right away by email. We happened to return for another night at the end of the week and the charger was placed in our new room inside a ziplock bag. The bell person/doorman Roger and others are wonderfully attentive and extremely helpful.   Shagrila Far East truly shows the best characteristics of Taiwan. We will definitely return. ",3
24097,"Great services.  All staffs are very friendly, polite and helpful.  In particular, I have to mention Eric, the Senior Guest Service Manager.  He greeted us while we arrived at the hotel door.  In our 33 days of stay, he greeted us every time with smiling face, and gave help immediately to our requests. The room is tidy and clean.  The king size bed is very comfortable.   Highly recommended and we will return for sure.",3
54004,"We checked in on a Saturday night and joined their weekly Meet Up session where we had a chance to chat with the local Japanese. It was also the perfect opportunity to make new friends amongst the other people staying in the hostel. After the event was over, a group of us continued chit chatting and we eventually headed out. The hostel staff helped us booked a taxi at 5am as we didn’t want to lug our luggage to the Shibuya Station as we head to the airport. He also spoke to the taxi driver to ensure we got dropped off at the correct entrance. We truly appreciated it as the taxi driver did not speak any Japanese. The rooms and shower rooms are clean and we had a comfortable stay. ",3
40909,"The staff here are absolutely wonderful. Simply the best. We stayed for 1 week and they absolutely made the stay wonderful. Every person from housekeeping and reception and luggage man is very kind and marvellous. They take time to smile and talk to you, give you tips where go what to do. Very very happy with the stay because of the staff. Room is okay, old but size is well. There's many shops and eatery nearby for food at all the time. ",3
54216,"We stayed together with my mom for 4 days at this hotel. We were feeling ourselves as at own home. The hotel is very cute and comfortable. It's very clean, I think it was the most crucial feature why we liked it a lot. Bathroom is made of marble. We had excellent breakfast with marvelous view on the top floor. The Topkapi Palace and Ayasofya are within 5-minute walking distance. Highly recommend it.",3
15551,"The staff was super friendly, it was very clean and not very noisy. I felt very safe and there are tons of yummy restraints near by. It was great that I could keep my bags locked away in a safe area before and after check in. It is also super convenient to shopping and the tram, along with the metro station.",3
50916,"Occidental Marhaba is a perfect place to go! I don't agree with negative reviews. We went there for 9 days - room was cleaned everyday, towels were changed too. We had one issue in a bathroom which was resolved with maintenance guy within half an hour 👍  The food is absolutely amazing! 🍽 You can choose whatever you prefer - poultry, beef, fishes and seafood available everyday, both during lunch and dinner. Home-made ketchup and all dressings also very food! Grilled veggies, chips, potatoes - WOW! 💪  Pools very clean - both indoor and outdoor. Animation team is absolutely fantastic. They serve perfect activities for young and old - absolutely recommend, even if you don't want to join, the team always helpful when ever you need them.  🏐   Waiters always smiling and ready to help or/and serve. 👔   The only issue I find is amount of glasses and plates in the restaurant. Very often I need to wait for a clean plate in the restaurant, also I wait long for a waiters to provide clean cutlery and glasses. Soft drinks should be available for everybody, not only served by waiters 😔  Also people reserve beds on a pool which is against the rules - big posters say ""no reserve"", but people ignore that. Some people reserve a bed at 7am and dont come back til 11am which is very rude and unprofessional. 😡   It can be tight in a high season, as amount of beds might be not enough, but beach is located very close to the pool and hotel, so beach can be used for a good relax 👍 Beach bar still does not work in May, but pool bar is absolutely enough 👍  Staff speaks in English only for the most important queries. For more ""sophisticated"" questions is always better to speak with reception, rather than waiters or barman. 🔠  To sum up - very good place to go for a holiday, either with kids or not. ♥ ",3
7100,Staff is very well mannered especially the owner remain a very good mood and very cooperative. The locality is also good. There is a coffee shop just outside the hotel. Also a supermarket on walking distance. Shared bathrooms but clean. Overall hotel is clean. Good for solo as well as family.,3
53875,"Very good service, the hotel is easy to access to many nice restaurants and cafes around. The staffs are friendly and the room is very clean and nice. They also have free shuttle bus to the BTS, highly recommended 👍🏽 K’Aun and K’Om gave very good services and were super friendly ",3
1059,"We have just left Nai Harn Beach Resort today and it feels like leaving family. This is our second visit to this gem of a hotel and it won’t be our last, we are already planning our next stay. Everything is spot on, the rooms are very reasonably priced,  they are spotless and have everything you need, tea/coffee making facilities, fridge, complimentary water daily, beach towels and even a beach bag!! The tv has all the channels you could possibly wish for, the bed was comfortable and huge. There is air conditioning and a safe in the room, the rooms are cleaned daily and the cleaners do an amazing job. Reception are obliging and helpful and nothing is to much trouble, they will go out of their way to assist. Thank you Sha and reception team. Lucky 13 restaurant is great with fresh, clean and very well priced food. The swimming pool area is a great place to relax and unwind and meet fellow travellers. Last but not least Lakeside bar, this truly is the best bar in Nai Harn, this is down to Chris( the owner), mama & Noi, we had many an evening dancing, singing, chatting and laughing at the bar as well as making new friends. Nai Harn Beach resort ticks all the boxes for a fantastic stay, we truly feel that we are leaving our family and best friends behind, but know that it won’t belong before we see them all again. Thank you Chris for your hospitality and great laughs. See you soon 👍",3

64047,Where to start ? The welcoming staff members ? The quietness of the super clean and elegant bedroom ? The amazing view on Athens and the sunset on the Acropolis while having a drink served by a very kind waitress ? The refreshing swimming pool ? The gym ? The location ? The normal price ?  EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WERE PERFECT ! My 11 years old daughter and I we thank you warmly for everything !  We stayed for four nights. For our next stay in Athens we will stay at the Divani Caravel. No doubt about it ! See you next year. Best regards from France Cyril,3
54593,This is a very large hotel as I have walking difficulties you have to careful when booking but was able to get room in main hotel. The room was very suitable and very clean. Food was good and all staff very helpful. Overall  I  had a very good experience and could have stayed another week with ease. ,3
15357,You can have it all in a pleasant way. We went off season but the hotel was quite full specially of German guests of all ages. Beware of the buffet if you do not want to add weight as it is excellent. Impeccable service. Rooms very comfortable. Good entertainment. Only small inconvenience wi-fi only in the lobby and slow.,3
41436,I stayed at Puri Bagus for 3 nights prior to heading to Ubud to teach a week long yoga retreat. This is an amazing location. Cabanas right on the beach. Great swimming and snorkeling close by. !0 minute boat ride to the white sand beach. The staff is incredible and they have three yoga pavillions. The grounds are incredible and there is an ancient temple on the grounds. I loves my stay here and I am already planning a trip back. Krishna and Anynihta are the BEST!!!!,3
47623,"I wish I could have found this place earlier! Clean and sweet room, cozy space for either couple or family. The staffs here are very friendly and the breakfast is varies every single morning! Excellent location for travelers, walking distantce to BTS station and the newest Icon Siam mall!",3
33338,"Comfortable beds, good food, nice size resort! Diego and Luis are the best poolside bartends a couple could ask for! Our housekeeper was a gem. The showers were a bit slippery so bring your shower shoes. I was sad the water was too choppy and you couldn’t go in. Other than that we had a great 5 days there! Only wish I would have booked a room with a tub cause my toddler hated the shower(not the resorts fault). ",3
676,"We had our wedding banquet in Holiday Inn Orchard Singapore and it was very well organised. The exterior of the hotel and the interior may appear antique but the ambience and smell are fantastic, it certainly makes us really relaxed and comfortable. In addition, it is surprising clean and service is amazing. The rooms are spacious and the beds are huge. Looking forward to another staycation in December this year.",3
25558,Excellent hotel ideally situated 2 mins walk away from Hendon Central Station. Staff were very pleasant & efficient particularly  Alessandro on reception who went out of his way to answer our queries on transport times. Ilknur was very friendly & efficient at breakfast & took great pride in making sure we had everything we needed. Had 3 very pleasant days staying at The Hide & would recommend it.,3

41106,"We stayed at the Le Meriden for a week and it was lovely, staff we all very helpful especially Goar the cleaning lady who couldn’t do enough for us and was very considerate. Location is perfect and close to everything",3
54576,Staff are amazing and always happy to help.  Restaurant are very busy but the staff work hard to make sure you have a table as quickly as possible.   I personally think the hotel is more aimed at the Russians but that didn’t stop us having a great time.    Only thing is that the Russians don’t like to cue and would often just walk to the front of a line after people have been waiting for a while x,3
15192,"Can not reccommend Sandra any higher. She is very curtious, friends and has always had a smiling face. She made our stay enjoyable. We came to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary together and had a fantastic stay. ",3
25093,"As always been a pleasure, great service, clean, very attentive. Not my first stay, however 1-2-3-30th is consistently good or slightly better. This my GOAT when in Warsaw. The casino a hidden gem as well as the gym with great swimming pool.",3
26127,"Yusuf, Erol & Yunus were the best hosts we've had. The rooms are beautifully decorated and a great place to get back to after a busy day of touring. The location is perfect for getting around. We were offered a Turkish coffee/tea and a chat at any time of the day. They gave us great recommendations on restaurants, entertainment and tour packages. Cube Suites is truly an excellent and warm place. We miss the guys already and will definitely recommend this place to anyone.",3
49065,Martha at the store at unique was so helpful when my teen didn’t listen and got super sunburn. She went out of her way and told us a new product to get which I guarantee us United States people Don’t Know about.And Jose at the pool served us first class. I don’t want to leave.,3
2879,"Lovely hotel, spotlessly clean and the beds are so comfy. Haven’t had to get up really early to get sunbeds for the 4 of us together, and the pool area is lovely and clean, with easy access to all of the food trucks and bars. The food has been incredible, both the main restaurant and the specialist restaurants. Staff are so friendly, and Mahsun from the Brandson Bar makes incredible cocktails and the view is amazing! ",3
65084,"Stayed for one night, when travelling to London for a conference.  The hotel was clean, comfortable, warm, (I stayed here in November) and very quiet - it's on a residential street so there is minimal passing traffic.   The room had everything you need, comfortable double bed, TV, desk and chair, wardrobe, hairdryer, full length mirror, kettle and tea/coffee. They also offer laundry services.  En suite bathroom with a rain shower, which was very nice.  Breakfast starts from 07:30 and was nice, checkout was very easy.   Would definitely stay again, or recommend for other business travelers.",3
38073,Charming row of 5 huts in beautiful and tranquil gardens with nice swimming pool which is usually empty. Breakfast is a few simple choices which are cooked for you and brought to your table. The owner and her staff made an exceptional effort to accommodate a couple of special requests from us. This accommodation is within a couple of hundred metres of a lovely beach which unfortunately is not safe most of the time for swimming. Would recommend for travellers and couples. Easy base from which to explore the island on a mo-ped.,3
40468,We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in April/2015 and loved every minute. We would like to say a big thank you to the hotel staff. Very pleasant and reasonably priced stay with an easy access to city center that is only about 20min away by public transport.,3
31309,"Really lovely staff , a little bit of a drive to get to the amazing attractions of Antalya, but if you are looking for a relaxing trip with an excellent lynx, this place is perfect ;). Pool is freezing however so toe dipping is required. Food is lovely. Be warned entertainment of a night catering for Russian ",3
7829,"Here comes Shangri-La Hotel Shenzhen, where the food is great! Miss Ava has given us a very good service experience. She is very professional, responsive, enthusiastic and pleasant in communication. Thank you very much for the considerate service of the staff of Shangri-La and your hotel!",3
39349,"Our room on the 9th floor of The Macleay had amazing views of the bridge,opera house and city skyline as well as views over Elizabeth Bay.  It was cleaned to a high standard and had a small fully equipped kitchenette and modern bathroom. Beds were very comfortable and the area outside was fairly quiet so we managed to sleep well. Although the room was fairly small, it was not imnportant  to us as we were out exploring all day and not returning until late.  The hotel is ideally located, with restaurants and shops close by and a few minutes walk to the train station. Reception staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. A perfect choice for us.",3
4502,Thank you so much team for such a nice gesture. Very friendly caretakers. Khun Johny you are awesome. Will meet you again in the next year. Free Wi-Fi and breakfast for the family members for 2 weeks.,3

17027,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at hotel giraffe. Bases on reviews I was expecting something extraordinary, which it wasn’t, but it was still a great landing pad for exploring NYC. I loved the location that felt very accessible to downtown, midtown and uptown. The beds were extremely comfortable and the balcony room was a nice addition. The all day eaters and snacks were also appreciated. The furnishings and everything are a bit dated but it felt very peaceful to return there after busy days.",3
47905,"Highly recommend this hotel. My father and I stayed for 3 nights during our visit to Milan. Immaculate conditions, friendly staff, and great room facilities. Location was perfect for us, only 20 mins on the metro to duomo. Couldn't recommend this hotel enough.",3

38568,This resort was wonderful when my wife and I visited. We had booked our 7 nights at the restaurant and this was great because of the great themes they had throughout the week. We cannot complain at all! It was great - the front of house staff helped us a lot and the travel desk guy. We had such a great time with the staff too - friendly and very sociable. ,3
58712,"We stayed there for a couple of nights over Easter and we really enjoyed our stay. The location of the hotel is amazing, right in the edge of Chinatown and the selections of restaurants around. Walking distance to darling harbour. The hotel itself is great, comfortable bed, clean room and bathroom. The only reason I didn’t give a 5 star is the lack of social distancing in the lifts and swimming pools. The hotel has a booking system for the pool ti limit the amount of people inside but it is not enforced. Same with the lift, sign said 2 people per lift and sometimes I had to ask people to read the sign or get out and take next lift. The hotel need to enforce the Covid safe policy a bit more. Overall I’ll come back for the location. ",3
45888,"We were very happy with our room. Parking was easy. So many great restaurants in walking distance.  I was there for a surgery at UCSF, it was very close and easy to get to UCSF. There was a cute window alcove looking out over Mel's Dinner. We sat in the window and watched traffic go by. Sheets, pillows, blanket, towels were all clean.",3
41680,"I recommend Alexis and his team. Great hospitality, from the port transfer directly to the villa. The transfers all over the island. I truly love blue  dolphins.

36868,"Excellent hotel, top service from all staff. Rooms are big and clean with very good Aircon and confy beds. Pool is very good, lifeguards name is Muhammad very friendly and helpful guy.

Overall excellent review and highly recommended.",3

47544,"Classy, well-designed, and well-maintained hotel.  Pros: 1. On a quiet street, yet 100 yards from supermarkets, boulangeries, patisseries, and many restaurants.  It’s in a very nice classic Parisian neighborhood in the 14th arrondissement. 2. Just around the corner from a metro stop. 3. Rooms have a small refrigerator and a safe. 4. The most outstanding feature of the hotel is the staff.  Front desk staff and breakfast wait staff were professional, competent, friendly, and very helpful.  Special thanks to Benoit, who was exceptionally pleasant and helpful, and also to Brice and Waly at the front desk for their help and advice. 5. Breakfast quality is excellent.  Wide variety of high quality food with some interesting dishes not always found on a buffet. 6. Very quiet hotel.  If you ask for a room on the back side you will hear nothing from the street. 7. Full shower glass wall and door in the bathroom is a plus.  Not the typical European half enclosure.  Cons: 1. Rooms are functional but small.  About average size for a European hotel, but more than one person cannot really stay in one of the queen-bedded rooms.  There just isn’t the space. 2. Bed pillows are far too soft and make it difficult to find adequate head support. 3. Lighting in the rooms is inadequate.  More lights and brighter lights need to be installed. 4. Unfortunately, on the last few days of our stay the breakfast was moved out into the restaurant to accommodate what appeared to be a private party in the breakfast area.  The breakfast dishes were not covered in the new location and were available for people to breathe on and drop bodily fluids into if they were careless.  Before Covid this would have been unacceptable, but now it’s simply irresponsible.  Subtract ½ point to 4½ due to this unprofessional and unappetizing presentation of the food.",3
18928,"A beautiful, historic hotel across from Parliament andSyntagma Square. Our room had a small balcony where we watched the changing of the guards and also a beautiful view of the Acropolis. The room was small, but faced the Square which gave us a feeling of openness in the city! We had two meals on the rooftop which were delicious and when room service mistakenly had the wrong room number, they comped the meal and also brought a bottle of wine. Great service!",3
28976,"I booked a room for my girlfriend and I for valentines day. I emailed Eden, the concierge staff, if the hotel could prepare some rose petals. She not only agrees to do it for free but also upgraded our room. Most thoughtful concierge ever!",3
46853,"We really enjoyed staying in this hotel. The bedroom was absolutely massive with a great view and also featured a small kitchen where you could prepare food if that was what you wanted to do. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. They could speak really good English. Food in the hotel, (especially the breakfast) was magnificent and the gardens and all the surrounding areas were well-kept and a joy to use. There was a free boat shuttle service from the hotel down to the Main junction, where u connect with other boats to see you around the resort. Highly recommended.",3

The experience begins the moment you check in (done from the comfort of the couch in my room) and continues through to the welcoming smiles every morning at breakfast (daily deliciousness); the staff is reason enough to stay here.   Other highlights include: central location with easy access to the Metro, great neighborhood food/shopping options, funky decor, and excellent amenities (complimentary minibar, rooftop pool and a top notch bar), staying here again is a no-brainer.",3

64766,"Soon as we arrived receptionist and staff were friendly and polite, we were supposed to have a superior room, but ended up getting deluxe, the view was amazing, room was fantastic, great space and comfy beds. Getting up the room was basically a workout but at times we would get a free ride that they offered. Breakfast was good, not the very best but they did have a selection, we had lunch there once and I weren't too impressed. Nevertheless, they had a great pool and great music choices, (If you're in your early 20's I would definitely recommend).   Wi fi was great, and all staff spoke perfect English which made my stay easier. The location is also good as there are nearby shops and loads of restaurants, it is very safe as there is security too, the atmosphere and vibe was good, perfect for pictures. There was one staff member who gave us advice and helped us with things such as booking dinners at restaurants. Much appreciated.  One thing I would say is that they could have informed us that we had to pay for the water bottles that they would place in our rooms everyday. On top of the fridge it states '2 bottles of complimentary water to drink'. So anyone would assume that they were free. To our surprise we had to pay 170 when leaving.   I would recommend this hotel and I would not mind staying here again. I loved Phuket!",3
36546,"The rating is based on this lovely hotel and the fantastic room we had.  However be warned, due it's location, there can be loud music from  the surrounding establishments, so light sleepers beware or bring earplugs. For us we were very tired at the end of the day and soon fell asleep.  We actually loved the location, even though you think you are in a shabby rundown street.  The Acropolis is a 20 minute walk and across the road is Monastiraki and Plaka tourist districts. Just behind is the fabulous night life of the Psiri district.  Lively  South American bars, good priced Greek restaurants, pizzerias, and themed dessert cafes such as Fairytale Athens and Little Krook.  The 'posh' Kolaniki district and Lycabettus Hill Cable Car can be walked to in 35 mins. We booked with hotels.com and were lucky enough to get a good discount on an Acropolis view room, (number 21), on the third floor. This was a big room, very clean, with a double bedroom and two sofa beds in the lounge.  The balcony was large and we had amazing views of the Acropolis by day and night. The staff were very friendly and very responsive to any emailed questions leading up to our stay, including help with transportation. We would highly recommend visiting Athens in October, it was warm, without being too hot and there were not huge crowds.",3

60860,"I have been staying here for decades, and it just gets better and better although it was fine to begin with.The rooms are sparkling clean.  The beds are comfortable with lots of pillows and warm blankets. The comfort just can't be beaten.  Wifi is strong.  And the staff are so friendly and helpful.  I also love all the art and the lobby is delightful as is the garden where guests can relax.  The ice water with mint and lemon was delicious, too.  The location is perfect to get everywhere in The City easily via public transportation.  If, like me, you are a native San Franciscan, you will be proud this wonderful place exists as it represents our special culture at its best.  I come home to visit old friends and family and The Metro makes it a complete joy.    ",3
56995,"Very stylish and comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Beautifully decorated and cozy rooms, nice restaurant and lovely courtyard where one can have a drink or take their meal. The only drawback was that at the time I staid, only set menu was available in the restaurant so after two days it became a bit repetitive as you would have had all options. ",3
4875,"excellent service. food is always delicious. my daughter love this hotel. swimming pool a little bit cold, maybe make it a little bit warmer is better especially October and November time.  ut other than that, everything were excellent.",3
62718,The location is in the center of the city and very easy to get to. There is a nice and quiet bar(Hari's) inside the hotel where I had the best service ever. The staff are friendly and helpful. They provide very good suggestion when you wanna try something new and wanna stay sober for the day. The staff Jeffrey there was amazing and made really good drinks. It is a very good alternative if you want to try somewhere else other than Lan Kwai Fong. ,3
65788,"Brilliant staff, so polite and attentive.  Really a highlight of our week at the hotel.  The food was always so good.  Cannot fault the stay in any regard. I would definitely come back as this was the best resort I have stayed at in six visits to Bali. The Garden Cafe's staff were all amazing, as was Krishna at the Watercourt. ",3
26840,"Loved my experience at Thavorn.  The location is good (not far from Kamala or Patong, they do free shuttle buses to both locations) Staff were lovely and very welcoming the whole time we were there. Food was nice and quite a good variety. I had a hillside room and my friends had a beachside room, both were incredible, air conditioning was fab and the views were incredible.  I would definitely stay here again",3
5665,"19 days we spent in this hotel were really beautiful! Every evening we could look at the magnificent sea from the balcony. Food gets the highest score, personal is very friendly and always ready to help. I also would like to thank the team of animators, who have always been smiling.In the animator Nikita, our daughter found a true friend! Thank you very much!",3
46101,Excellent experience overall.  The style of the Hotel is quirky and original.  Well located close to shops and downtown monuments and restaurants!  As the first Hotel in our trip was a great first stop!  ,3
32156,"The front desk was very helpful especially Jeremy.  Love the kitchen in the room. The room was spacious, the breakfast was yummy especially the texas shaped waffles. Thank you for making it like a 2nd home!  I'll be back😊",3
54380,"Highly recommend this restaurant. Not only was it clean, beautiful and comfortable the service was absolutely amazing. By far the best of our trip. Upon our arrival Serkan noticed we were upset and frustrated. He asked us what was wrong before even checking in. After finding out we had been significantly over charged by our taxi driver he offered us drinks on the house, brought us up to the rooftop right away said he would handle our check in and luggage and for us to go relax. He then met us on the rooftop to go over the map of the city and help us plan everything g we wanted to see. He was so knowledgeable and suggest an amazing restaurant for dinner. He completely changed our day around. The service from everyone at the hotel was exceptional! If we are ever in Istanbul again we will definitely stay at Hotel Amira. ",3
67357,I have stated almost every Hilton brand hotel and wanted to try something different because recently the Doubletree‘s & the Garden Inns & Embassy Suites are just not what they used to be.  I’m so glad I tried the Martinique it was fabulous from the check-in to the room and even the morning breakfast service at the restaurant in the hotel was great. I would highly recommend staying there,3
13778,"I really enjoyed Amari pattaya during my stay. Clean room, very nice pool and restaurant. Also very close to access famous places in pattaya. My friend was also very satisfied with this hotel overall.",3
36515,"A company trip for 40-plus employees and guests. The staff at Secrets the Vine Cancun was awesome. First-class service!  The rooms, the spa, the food, the entertainment, etc. were great. A few of our employees are already planning a return trip. Highly recommend the resort. Kudos to Leticia Ku, Groups and Convention Manager for handling everything so effortlessly. ",3
8296,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay. Even though we arrived very late (there was a problem with our taxi) we felt very welcome.  The hotel is very well located, extremely nice building, very nice interiors and everything we needed was there, in a rather exclusive version. Extremely clean. ",3
17867,"Absolutely stunning hotel. The staff is great, the atmosphere is amazing and the hotel pays attention to so much detail. Details in design, details in room amenities, details during breakfast or room service, details in staff behavior, that is what the hospitality business is all about and they understand that very well in this hotel. It breaths 5 stars and it deserves 5 stars. If you want to know how to run a hotel; stay here and pay good attention. It's a textbook example.  The room (executive) is nice and quiet. Perfect bed and enough space.   PS: if you come by car then you might wonder where they store your car with the valet service. I was surprised how that was arranged. A huge private (for just your car) garage 6 stories under the ground, I guess there is no safer place in Milan for your car than there.   ",3
46625,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Villa Matissa just this weekend. Breakfast in the beautiful garden was a great way to start busy days in Rome. The room was modern,spacious and clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I am going to recommend Villa Matissa for my friends and family if they are going to Rome in the future.",3
37532,"Excellent location and excellent service. Very convenient for transport, food and shopping. Service staff were very helpful especially the front desk staff Anthea, who always has a smile and went the extra length to help us. We are very appreciative of her and also with the porters. Keep up the good work.",3
30908,Andres Douglos was the most helpful employee at Lakeside Diner. He jumped up to help us at everything we needed. I heard him interacting with other customers and he was kind and gracious with them also. Thank you so much for making us feel at home!! ,3
53166,"Wow. I am SO happy I found Mooo by the Castle, because we had the loveliest stay here. Our apartment, number 14, was beautiful and flooded with natural light from the windows--with a large bedroom (with such a comfortable bed), living/dining room, kitchen, and bathroom. It was beautiful with the most stunning painted ceiling. We couldn't believe it when we were shown the room after check in. It was such a relaxing retreat from the hustle and bustle of the highly concentrated tourist areas of Prague, and after some very long days of walking miles and miles! Maria & Martyna were both so warm, kind, and friendly and left personal touches in the room that really made it special. The location is beautiful, and quiet, and the views from the windows were so magical. We were glad we didn't stay in the Old Town (so crowded!), and we didn't mind the walk because everything in Prague is so stunning, especially in this part of town. Mooo is right by the Castle (per the name), and a little market, some cute shops, and especially great for us, there is a vegan restaurant just around the corner (Vegan's)! Honestly, our stay here was one of the best stays in a hotel we have ever had. This hotel is stunning, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!!! Highly, highly recommend!! Thank you so much for a truly wonderful stay in Prague.",3
43882,"What a fantastic place! The service was amazing, with the concierge helping us book dinner and transport. Breakfast each morning was a delicious spread of pastries, breads, fruit, meat and cheese, delivered to the room at the time specified by us the day before. Housekeeping kept the apartment spotlessly clean and refreshed everything, including the supply of coffee, daily! The bedrooms were comfortable with great storage and we loved the touch-control blackout blinds, lights and aircon. The building is in the centre of Athens so just a short walk to everywhere you’d want to visit, and with plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. That said, there was quite a lot of street noise at night so that’s worth bearing in mind! ",3
29406,"First time travelling solo and definitely glad I booked this place. Perfect if you're travelling alone or as part of a group. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. There were group dinners organized in the evening, as well as pub crawls. Food was alright and for the price I'm not going to complain about a three course meal and seemingly unlimited sangria! The atmosphere was really chill and there were plenty of spaces to relax. The hostel in general just looks cool. The rooms were clean and my bunk was surprisingly comfortable and had a curtain for privacy. I took the advice of other travellers and brought 2 locks for my personal storage. Location is pretty good with the metro only a few minutes away. Sites like Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila & Batlló are within walking distance. There are plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby and a supermarket around the corner. Would highly recommend this hostel and would go back in the future.",3
35445,"The Hyatt Regency Chicago did not disappoint as a venue for the conference. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff members were efficient, polite and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this location for vacations as well as business meetings.",3
66760,"Staying for the Brian cox evening at the 02 bought as a present after a long 2year wait due to covid! the ibis was Easy to find, we didn’t want to us the underground and we weren’t in a hurry to get there, so we caught the Uber boat from Waterloo to North Greenwich and then the London cable car over to the other side, it was a really nice relaxing way to travel to the hotel, and it’s about an 10minutes walk from the cable cars!  Canning station is directly opposite aswell as a bus station (which we didn’t know)  On arrival we were warmly welcomed and given our keys, the room was lovely and clean (some building works going in next door but you didn’t hear them)  Bathroom was clean and tea/coffee facilities were topped up and ready to use, the hotel placed a cake/balloons and a card ready which I thought was a lovely gesture and we got a free drink front the bar. The O2 is one stop away from canning station so very easy to get to.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the breakfast in the morning was delicious with a lot of variety available. Definitely recommend this hotel the staff are very kind and helpful, and we will stay again if we visit london. :-)",3
67213,My stay at the Shangri-La in Suzhou was a nice surprise since i was not sure what to expect. It is a good value for the level of service and ammendities. You can trust the breakfast buffet will satisfy all customers with a wide variety of fresh food. The gym and pool were both first class and catered to my training needs even though i am away from home. I would also like to recommend the Jing Chen Spa services locate in the hotel. The foot and body massage at the end of a long business day was a perfect. The staff is super friendly and helpful at a fair price. I would like to thank Wang Lee for taking such good care of me.,3
61851,"Stayed with friends in a family room and was very pleased with the experience. The room was well-equipped, although the bathroom was small. Check-in was easy and could have been done remotely. The room rate wasn't cheap (most likely due to the rugby), and we opted to skip breakfast. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's close to lots of amenities and not a long walk to any part of Dublin. No issues at all, would recommend for a short break in Dublin.",3
7924,"We came across this small hotel by accident, following an intensive search on the internet, even though we’re frequent visitors to the City of Light. It was a very positive accident!  This has to be our favourite hotel in Paris! It is comfortable, welcoming and has been sensitively designed to reflect its location and the wider history of Paris (evidenced by the excellent historical portrait engravings hanging on many of the walls). The location means it is quiet and away from the maddening crowds. A haven of peace and comfort! Another advantage of the location is the very close proximity to some excellent bistros, etc.  Our room, whilst not large, was more than adequate for our stay. The en-suite was also more than adequate. Together they made for a very comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable stay.  Breakfast is taken in the restored and renovated basement. It is classic French - and very fresh too, especially the bread. Choice could be improved, but then the French do not usually indulge in anything comparable to a ‘full Scottish breakfast’!  This hotel represents a rarity in that there was nothing we could fault, or suggest improvements to.  Once the pandemic travel restrictions are completely lifted we will be booking for a longer stay; hopefully Spring 2021!",3
12971,La Cucina has amazing food; Kaushik was very helpful. The food was well seasoned and balanced. The pizzas are delicious (we had the original La Cucina pizza and the green lasagne). The service is brilliant and punctual.,3
12260,"I cannot say enough fantastic things about Hotel Zoe!! First, THE LOCATION! Right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf!! I was there this past weekend with family and hadn't been to San Francisco since 2006 and this hotel was THE perfect place to be. It was within walking distance of so many great attractions and restaurants. Second, the value! I couldn't find a better price, especially for the location. Third, the hotel itself is beautiful, modern, and cozy. Their outside courtyard is fantastic! A great place to enjoy the s'mores they provided. Fourth, the most impressive part of this hotel is its staff! They are genuine and willing to help in any way possible. I would specifically like to recognize two and they are Eric the Housekeeping Manager and Lucila. They went above and beyond to find the piece of art that I had left behind and mailed it back to me. I will definitely be visiting Hotel Zoe, again!!! Well done!",3
65789,"Beautiful resort with native trees and wild animals  Staff is absolutely amazing from reception, housekeeping, kids club and waitresses. Breakfast was fantastic however lunch and dinner a bit repetitive after a few days ",3
47631,Lovely place. Lovely people. My HOME in BKK. Great location: Near sky train. Near Praya river. Easy to grab a cab. Great breakfast: Thai or Continental. Latte available!!! Super Quiet. Huge Room. C u soooon Faby!,3
17317,"We stayed in this hotel for 1 night. Very nice, clean, staff very friendly and helpful. Secured parking, some places covered. Quiet location, close to metro (2 min). Beds are little bit soft, but ok. Breakfast tasty. Will stay here again.",3
51534,the room service has done very good job to take care of the customer her name is 潘秀勤。 very nice people and with good service.  一个非常勤快努力的工作者希望香格里拉酒店珍惜并且爱护这样的员工正是因为这样的员工让我们住客喜欢上香格里拉因为这里有家一样的感觉。希望潘秀勤再接再厉加油工作,3
61204,"Great location. Staff very helpful, good spot for short term. Very small rooms but sufficient. Good breakfast included. In walking distance to the acropolis and we could see it from our balcony. Nice restaurants nearby",3
10483,"We celebrated our 21st Anniversary in Live Aqua Resort. All we can say is that they didn't fall short but exceeded our expectations. We loved our stay here and couldn't wait to be back to feel pampered and be well taken care of again. Marco and David from 7 are the greatest ever, they took care of us as if we're family and they went above and beyond.   Sandra from activities recommended the Chichen Itza excursion and it was fabulous and we had a blast. We also received a great service experienced from Omar, Sonia (massage), Efrain, Jesus and Luis. Overall, our experience has been great and we couldn't wait to be back with our friends and family. I highly recommend this resort.",3
38516,"Above and beyond our expectations.  We felt like we had found a quiet, special spot.  The gardens were well maintained and lovely.  Breakfast was varied and a huge choice to suit anyone, even my very fussy daughter.  Pools were great.  Rooms very clean. Mosquito nets a bonus, as was the private balcony. Rooms were a very good size and very clean. Great service at all times with smiling faces.  We felt so welcome.",3
10934,This hotel was beautiful. Perfect for first time stay in NYC. Super clean comfortable staff superbly helpful and friendly. The rooms so clean air conditioning. Ice machines on every floor. So central to all sights ,3
6177,"I returned to Austin and checked in May 8, 2021, due to my Mom being in the hospital.  Not long after my arrival, she was diagnosed with a terminal illness and put in Hospice Care.  I became a resident, as I stayed for 5 ½ months.   Every accommodation was perfect!! Very clean, great breakfast, two bottles of water daily, location, pool, very comfortable bed and the amazing staff!!     I normally struggle being able to sleep in any bed  besides my own.  The bed was very comfortable and I was very grateful!!  I have asthma and began coughing a lot at night. My request for the a/c filter to be checked/cleaned, replace all bedding… was met immediately and  with such kindness. The carpets were in the process of being shampooed, so that was a plus. After all that, it turned out I needed a change in my asthma medication.  However, I’m very appreciative for the assistance to my requests!   The staff went above and beyond in every aspect imaginable. They  literally became like friends, during my long stay. They went beyond being hotel employees and were a huge support, during this very difficult time in my life.  I couldn't be more grateful for such an amazing group people.   A very special thank you to Robbie, Jennifer, Jo, Tanner, Obie, Lisa Z, Brianna, Sara, Abbie and Lucy!  My stay was such a safe haven, I did not want to leave.  Robbie (GM) always had a smile, said hello, asked if I needed anything… He stated “I know Jennifer and Joe are taking excellent care of you, but don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything.”  I appreciated as the GM he knew without a doubt; his staff was taking excellent care of my needs.  Thank you, Robbie, for your leadership, which shows in the staff.  I wish you all the best!  Jennifer (Assistant GM) was my main Management contact and her door was always open.  She was extremely helpful in how I needed my billing done and I was appreciative of that.  I admire her management style of having an open-door policy, for employees and guests.  If her office door was closed, it was because she was filling in a different area of the hotel. I figured this out, when running into her all over the hotel, as we said our hellos and I’d ask what she was working on today.  Without fail, Jennifer always had a smile on her face. was extremely kind, helpful and asked how my Mom and I were doing. As time went on, I sat in her office a few times, as I just needed to talk.  Jennifer graciously listened and I’m very grateful for her time. Thank you, Jennifer, for your leadership, which shows in the staff, the handling of my billing and the personal time you graciously offered me to come in your office and talk.  I wish you all the best as you progress in your career!  Jo, although the Maintenance Manager (not sure of his exact title), he helped in the breakfast area each morning.  Not only cleaning, restocking…, but visiting with guests.  It was obvious he was genuinely interested in getting to know the guests and make them feel more at home.   Jo was extremely helpful in accommodating the availability of the pool for morning exercise.  I’m grateful for him making the  accommodation, as we cared for my Mom later in the day.  Jo too always had a smile, asked how my Mom and I were doing.  His  genuine chats at breakfast were pleasant, on what could already be a difficult day. I appreciate the numerous times he helped me bring HEB… bags to my room and perfectly loading my car when checking out. He also provided excellent maintenance service.  Thank you, Jo, for your excellent hospitality and I wish you all the best in your career!  Tanner always had a smile, said hello, asked how  my Mom and I were doing and provided excellent maintenance service. I appreciate the times he helped me bring HEB bags…. to my room and the chats, we had in the lobby/elevator. I greatly appreciated him bringing me ice, when I hurt my knee and could hardly walk.  Thank you Tanner and I wish you all the best!  Obie always had a smile, said hello, asked how my Mom and I were doing and provided excellent maintenance service. I appreciate the  times he helped me bring HEB bags… to my room and the chats we had in the lobby/hall. I greatly appreciated him bringing me ice, when I hurt my knee and could hardly walk. Thank you Obie and I wish you all the best!  Lisa Z was the best housekeeper I’ve ever had!!  It was very obvious when Lisa had cleaned my room!!!  She always had a smile, said hello, asked how my Mom and I were doing.  I appreciate the times she helped me bring HEB bags… to my room and  the chats we had in the lobby/hall.  I greatly appreciate her brining me ice when I hurt my knee and could hardly walk.  Thank you Lisa and I wish you all the best!  Brianna always had a smile,  said hello, asked how my Mom and I were doing.  One evening not long after my arrival Brianna was helping me to my room with HEB bags or laundry and I was trying to hold it together, while we unloaded the cart.  Before I knew it, I was in tears and felt like I was going to collapse, just having found out my Mom was terminally ill. God Bless her, Brianna hugged me like she’d known me her entire life.  Had she not hugged me, I very well may have collapsed.  I’m very grateful her hospitality went above and beyond in that moment.  Thank you Brianna and I wish you all the best!  Sara always had a smile, said hello, asked how my Mom and I were doing.  She was always ready to hand me my daily water bottles, which I appreciated.  Several times she got me extra towels and delivered packages to my room, which I appreciated as well.  Thank you Sara and I wish you all the best!  Abbie was always very busy with a stack of paperwork.  However, it never stopped her from taking the time to stop, say hello and take care of any needed requests.  I appreciated her respecting my do not disturb, and even checking with me before letting a meal delivery upstairs.  Thank you Abbie and I wish you all the best!  Lucy always had a smile, said hello and asked how I was going.  We didn’t talk much, but it was a pleasure to see her smile and hear her hello, on many difficult days.  She knew I was struggling with the loss of my Mom and not wanting to leave.  I appreciated she asked if she could hug me the day I left.  Again, another staff member that felt like a friend.  Thank you Lucy and I wish you all the best!  I hope to see each of you again, on my next trip to Austin!",3
10033,Stay Here Multiple days for a mini vacation. Close to public transportation and the airport. Staff was super helpful and nice! Plenty of parking- did I mention free! Issues addressed fast by staff. Would recommend ,3
36607,"Excellent location, walk to Acropolis. We stayed here before boarding a cruise in Piraeus. The hotel arranged a cab to pick us up from airport. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony that had an excellent Acropolis view. The next day we stored our luggage at the hotel and toured the New Acropolis Museum when it first opened and wasn't busy. Breakfast, included , was excellent and we had dinner in the hotel which we enjoyed. ",3
44114,"Absolutely an amazing hotel.   Simply stunning, which no pictures can truly capture.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  Went for our honeymoon  and didn't fail to meet all we hoped to make our stay as wonderful as it was.  Highly recommend.",3

29642,"My husband and I stayed in one of the amazing overwater bungalows that faced the mountains - best view if you don't want to just stare out at the ocean. The rooms were so nice and clean, the service was impeccable!   What is so underrated is the SNORKELING! If you head to the last row of over water bungalows there is a huge reef drop off, like maybe 50 feet? So natural and beautiful hundreds of beautiful tropical fish and eels as well as the occasional reef shark.",3
26019,We had a great time!  The entertainment was a huge hit with our family.  Mr Black in the House was so fun and personable.  He remembered us by name and checked with us daily to make sure we were having a great day!,3
54130,"I came across Makers Hotel on a hotel booking website while planning our trip to Seoul. Initially I was hesitant to stay in the ""tourist area"", since I imagined something like Khao San Road in Bangkok. The price was also very reasonable -- and inclusive of breakfast -- which made me wonder if it was too good to be true. But the photos looked great, the website looked great, and the reviews were good, so I booked.   NO REGRETS!!! We stepped into the lobby late in the evening, and the look and smell of the place were perfectly charming and restful and took away the exhaustion of the trip there*. Mike who checked us in was very friendly and efficient, and was patient with our questions. The room was small and simple but thoughtful and comfortable, with a nice work desk, a firm bed, a bench for sitting and placing luggage, a safe, slippers and robes, and lots of storage space in the closet. The bathroom is modern and very functional, and the toiletries smell GREAT. And everything is insanely CLEAN.  But our favorite thing by far was the breakfast. We had expected a crowded, chaotic, bare-bones kind of setup -- too many stays at the Hampton Inn! -- but instead we entered a dining room that was beautifully designed, so clean, and had jazz music playing. What a great way to start the day. The food was wonderful too -- cereal, Korean rice, ham and cheese, breads, coffee, soup, salad, and more.   Thank you Makers Hotel, we will definitely stay with you again when we're next in Seoul!  *One word of warning: if you're taking the Airport Express train, be sure to get on the 5 Line to get to station Exit 4. We got on the 1 Line and got to Exit 3, since that's what Googlemaps and Naver Maps told us to do. We ended up lugging our luggage through REALLY long, winding subway passages, sometimes up and down stairs since there were no options for elevators or escalators. And it's a longer walk from Exit 3 to the hotel too. Good thing the lobby was such a welcome sight -- took the exhaustion and crankiness away instantly!",3
53255,"If you want a WOW then this is the place to go. Any hotel can be a great building, have fancy features  but Hotel Clark is a massive cut above the rest  due to its employees . Boglarka, Boroka, Zsombi , Atila and Victor to name just a few. The hotel itself is a magnificent hidden gem and you know instantly it was a labour of love due to each tiny detail throughout ( take a moment to read the Hotel Clark book in your room) . I have travelled all around the world and have never EVER encountered better service . If you’re thinking of booking just do it , the hotel has a great location on the Buda side of the chain bridge and also has a fantastic rooftop restaurant .. believe me I tried a few and you will not get a better view with equally great food . I planned to surprise my daughter for her 30th and booked a hotel room for her ( she had no idea I would be there) and from my first communication with Boroka the hotel could not do enough . Great communication and enthusiasm for my “surprise” too and my daughter was gobsmacked when she arrived . I cannot praise this hotel enough, it was honestly flawless.   Thank you Hotel Clark I will definitely return ",3
28486,"Very good hotel for family stay.  Nice breakfasts with different kitchen (European, Indian and Asian), picturesque seaview from the balcony, good seashore and good outside swimming pools to swim and relax.  Very friendly service and working people.  For those, who like sports - there are some activities and a nice sports gym.  5 days during week yoga. It's very good for health. Yoga teachers Lek Ms. Jirawan and Mr. Golf (he teaches, when Lek has holidays) are very good and friendly. They make yoga activities very good. Thanks alot to them both.  Wifi is not super fast, but ok and it's almost everywhere on territory and in rooms.   Bottled water in rooms is complementary and it's very nice. Cleaning everyday is good.  So, it was a good experience for everyone in our family (include 2 children). ",3
20432,Hotel perfect location. Staff very helpful and friendly. Could not do enough for you. Carlos on front desk was a credit to this hotel. Superb customer service and so helpful and friendly. Rooms clean and tidy. Ask for high floor as you wont hear subway then. Will defo recommend and stay here again. ,3
237,"Once again, we stayed almost a week. Friendly and efficient guest service at the reception deks, clean room, good hearty breakfast, and ideal location to walk around and dine out in Trastevery, Charming, cosy inner garden where you can eat breakfast.",3
370,"I was just there for a night, but it's going to be the first place we check for future Chicago trips. It's super convenient if you're visiting Roger's park, but it's just a couple of blocks to a Red Line stop, so it's easy to get to the loop and all of the tourist parts of the city. Like a lot of other reviews have said, it's really inviting just to lounge around and enjoy the space, so if you're a traveler who's going to need some alone time (e.g. you're visiting family), this place would be great!",3
63608,"My daughter and I stayed there for two nights. Excellent service from front desk, belle's men and housekeeping from the time we arrived until we left. All my questions were answered and suggestions for restaurants and outings. ",3
40374,"I stayed for three days prior to joining a boat to sail from Thailand to Borneo so I was looking forward to some rest and relaxation prior to several months of cramped conditions. The resort organised transfers for me and also a scooter for the time I was there. All in all, the service was good with the only downside being the reception desk is closed at night. The room was small but well kept and the gardens well maintained with a great swimming pool. An easy walk to the nearby shops and Chalong. There is no real beach to speak of at Chalong so if you want a resort and beach type location this is not the choice. If you want somewhere quiet and well located to explore the southern part of Phuket it is a good option.",3
1055,"Naiharn is a wonderful part of Phuket and Naiharn Beach Resprt is one of it's local gems.  Chris and his team are amazing and the resort gives you everything you need.  The rooms are spacious, impeccably clean and super quiet at night.  The aircon was awesome, the bathroom is huge and the shower is one of the best parts of ending a hot day.  The restaurant has something for everyone and the staff were super friendly and the food really tasty and well priced.  For fun, the bar is really nice. A pool table becomes the centre of activity and we had a few really fun nights meeting the community.  It is just a few minutes walk to the beach and the hotel provides a bag a towels for you free of charge.  Chris (the owner) was the perfect host and we were really sad to leave.

12305,"Everything was excellent and beyond my expectations.  Location was great - easy access to tourist areas, but just outside of the busier areas.  Restaurant closed pretty early.  Understand closing the kitchen, but I feel safer having a night cap in the Hotel.",3
14125,I recommend this hotel to any person who wants to both relax and have nightlife in city. The location was wonderful. The pool and the seaside was unforgettable. The staff were very friendly.  Staying in this hotel will be a very good mempry of Phuket for me. ,3
2248,"This B&B is awesome! It is a 10 minute walk from the metro station at the Colosseum and is in a quiet area with great restaurants nearby. It is a very small entrance into what seems to be an apartment building, and once you are inside the B&B you are so thankful for the wonderful air conditioning. We were in contact with Aldo before arriving and then taken care of by Marco during our stay. They were both incredible hosts. Marco gave us some great suggestions for dinner, especially some good local spots that were not touristy at all! In terms of the room, the bed was really comfortable, the AC worked great (it was July and it was HOT), it was very clean, and it had great decor. The breakfast each morning is brought over to you and you can have breakfast in bed, which my wife was obsessed with. It comes with a fun assortment of pastries, juices, fruit, and coffee. It was delicious!  Overall, we loved our stay at this B&B. We loved the cozy room, the quiet location, and the yummy breakfast. We hope to be back soon!",3
7557,"We stayed in the Pullman Zhuhai the first time driving over from Shenzhen.  Greetings are very friendly and free parking is offered. Check in was fast, professional and friendly. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and English speaking. Especially the woman looking over the Gym/pool area was outstanding. The room is nice and clean, a little small but this was expected as the room size is clearly communicated during booking.  Great choice of food for breakfast, quality is very good. I would have liked it, if the staff would have guided us to a free table, we were somehow left by ourselves finding one in a quite full restaurant. Also the offering of tea or coffee after sitting down was missing.  The location is great, and we took advantage of the free shuttle bus to the border to Macau.  Overall a really good choice when staying in Zhuhai, either for business or leisure!",3
22382,"Lotte Hotel in Jung-gu is much much better in person than the photos. It is a stunning place. The staff are amazing, so kind and helpful. The rooms are beautiful and spacious with lovely fittings and design. The common areas are so delightful with an amazing garden with beautiful rock falls and a gorgeous piano bar with charming decor and chandeliers. The location is perfect and only a short walk to groovy Myeondong.   Highly recommend. You will love this accommodation.  Being located above Lotte Department store so convenient with Food Avenue super close to chose a range of meals. ",3

The hotel has got every comfort, even baths and showers to use if you don’t have the room anymore. There also a storage for personal belongings with keys. Everything was perfect!",3
13081,"Booked this hotel months ago and was kept in constant contact with Cameron who is the supervisor of this excellent hotel. She advised about travelling from the different airports and gave us an option of arranging a private transfer or a shuttle bus. All the staff were excellent and prepared a fresh breakfast every morning. We were given a free upgrade to the wonderful roof top suite which had a view of the marmaris sea. The room was very clean and the choice between hard and soft pillows an excellent touch. The night porter Furkan made us lovely toasties as we left at 5am at the end of our stay. Excellent hotel, location,staff and value. Highly recommended and can't wait to return.",3

58155,"I stay at this on its second official business day, everything works perfectly! Whole property is designed luxury of good taste, while the staffs are extremely engaged, friendly and helpful. The gym,although not big, is superior equipped, with friendly staffs. The club offers very good choices of snacks for afternoon tea and happy hour.  I was overwhelmed by many small but tasteful gifts for the grand opening.  Located at the border cross to Macau, overseeing the hongkong and Zhuhai and Macau bridge, the hotel is best located for any visitor to the region. I shall return!",3
20382,"I had the pleasure of a one night stay at the Sofitel, and it was total and complete perfection.  Hotel has super grand entrance and smells incredible from the moment you enter the glittering lobby.  Lobby is breathtakingly beautiful with numerous floral arrangements.  Check in was a breeze.    My room was huge and had every comfort.  Beautifully designed with gorgeous, modern furniture.  Bed was very comfortable.  Linens top quality.  Lanvin toiletries smelled amazing.    Only meal I partook of was breakfast, which was huge and offered everything you could possibly want.    I regret only having one night.  I CANNOT WAIT to return to this property for a longer stay!",3
6797,"One of the most convenient hotel stays I have ever experienced. Staff are very kind, polite & helpful, English language is an opportunity for improvement. They were very flexible to allow for early check in. Room was will equipped although not spacious but adequate for purpose. WiFi service is fast & reliable & allow for more than a device at a time. Premises is well maintained everything in the room was functioning perfectly. Location was great for me. Ask to take room viewing Main Street. Definitely I would comeback there if visited Osaka again.  ",3
53104,"Great location, very nice apartments, great service, their driver service is excellent. Everything is really well done. Only minus point is that they don’t serve breakfast but there are some good places just around the hotel.",3
35045,Our family stayed for 4 nights. We chose the hotel being Accor members. Check-in was quick and the room was bigger than expected knowing the brand. Bed was firm but we asked  for the free mattresses topper to made sleeping better. Bathroom is small but not cramped for 1.   Hotel breakfast is a mix of eastern and western food. Accor plus members can get discounts on food. We had free drinks due to our membership level. They offered to store our luggage while we went for a day and a half trip to Macau. Very handy service.  Getting there is easy with the free shuttle bus to and from the Hong Kong central Airtrain station. There is one every 30 min or so depending on traffic.  Pulic bus stops just outside of hotel can take you to Kowloon or around Hong Kong Island.  MTR is near and so is the Macau Ferry terminal. Tram stop is just 100m away too. Very happy to have had so many options.  Laundromat is across the street next to a 7-Eleven. Wellcome supermarket is just 200m away. Restaurants on the streets  near the hotel but not as many as expected.   Just a very convenient hotel for a family to see the best of Hong Kong and price is good for everything listed in the review. Will stay again. ,3
27868,"I had 1 night here, i don't often choose homestay as a place to rest but as a friend suggested me to come, I made my way to try it out. It was good and comfy at all , historical lessons learned from the locals. I had a cool dream being a Thai while sleeping in their comfy bed. It was fun at all, not really superstitious but as they said the some passed Thai were trying to welcome me by hanging out with me in my dream. Believe it or not, many fun stories came up about the souls and stuffs. ",3

30115,"30 Bencoolen was central - clean, tidy and modern room. Swimming pool upstairs was great, staff helpful.

At first, we are a bit strange with the self help and dormitory model hostel, and also shared bathroom. but as first night pass, this hostel is very homie.   First, the interior was minimalist and very efficient. So, we're doing very well in self helping us in this hostel. Shared bathroom also wouldn't be a problem;. The door can be closed for the kids to take 2 bathrooms at the same time. Did I mention clean? Yes it's clean hostel, they did very good job maintain the cleanness level.   The lounge was lovely, very nice touch in the interior, and also very home feel like... It also a place where people could meet and interact.   And the location, it's very very strategic;.

It is a good, inexpensive option for Milan, especially when traveling by train since it’s less than a 5 minute walk from Milan Centrale station. The staff was very friendly and rooms were modern and clean, although bathroom were on the small side and not as updated. The breakfast buffet (free as a Diamond member) was a little chaotic and overcrowded but the food was ok. Food in and drinks in the lobby bar were good. The gym was ok and pretty standard for this type of hotel. It had dumbbells up to 24 kg, a cable machine, and a few other machines. Overall a good stay.",3

Delightful, pleasant, hospitable staff. Would return without hesitation!",3

This Japanese hotel is ultra chic, that going to the bathroom never been so “enjoyable” (lol), everything is so advance it’s like the toilet of the future, and I can’t believe the price of it when I check It online. The interior of the hotel has a very calm vibe, the main lobby is at the top of the hotel, and the floors below are the rooms. Once you get out of the hotel, the aroma of food and the smell of varying kinds of of beauty products will greet you and set the tone of your day....",3

533,A large group of us stayed at the Gansevoort for a big event in October and had the best time. Almost a month later I realized that I had ordered clothes and had them shipped to the hotel instead of my home address in California. I was panicked because these clothes were important and I needed them by the end of the week. I called the hotel and was directed to Gabriella to help me with this. I gave her all my information and she found the package and had it overnighted to me within an hour. This type of service is why this will be the only hotel I stay at in New York City. Thanks to the amazing team at the hotel who made this all possible.,3
56049,"Overall: 9/10 Staff: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Location (to cbd): 8/10 Transit: 8/10 Room: 10/10 Common Areas: 9/10 Breakfast: 10/10 Restaurant/ Bar: 8/10  Vibe (/bar/): 6/10  I’ve stayed at this hotel twice and would absolutely come back if I was in Sydney again.  Beyond being a very nice hotel with large rooms, excellent staff and super accommodating, the big draw for me was the location and the view. Just a couple blocks to the harbor side of the business district and the restaurant has a spectacular perspective down to the bridge / opera house / all of it.   The pool and spa both looked nice, certainly resort style facilities while the gym is one of the best I’ve seen at any hotel, even if some equipment is a bit dated.  Booking via amex fine hotels program turned this from a nice stay into a great stay at a great value. Traveling solo, I had no issue getting a (simple) dinner and lunch via room service as well as a drink at the bar well within my resort credit. The 4pm checkout was perfect for a late day flight and the staff got me checked in super early on arrival as well. Breakfast is a solid spread plus one hot / fresh selection that’s all well done and a perfect start to the day, at least when it’s included.  The biggest drawback I can see is the hill to walk up to the place but you can avoid the stairs by coming up another street (left 3 blocks) and the location puts you right by the bridge stairs to get to fantastic views.   The restaurant / bar service was also spotty both nights though I was only there for a drink so I don’t want to read too much into that. Room service was however fast and spot on.",3
3199,"Fabulous district, fabulous apartment, fabulous staff, what's not to like. Area was the best of the best, apartment was excellent, everything you could need was provided.

Well done Inside Barcelona Apartments.",3

Probably the best scrambled egg I have ever had. Definitely recommend. There are stairs.,3
44810,"Generally speaking I enjoyed my stay and found the location to be very convenient. The staff deserve high praise for their courteous and welcoming attitude, always smiling and helpful.

The location is a pleasant distance, bit not to far from the bars and restaurants, so noise is never intrusive.  I'd not hesitate to return at some future date, just that there's so many beautiful islands in the Agean.",3
28948,"We were staying here on the weekend of the Chicago Marathon.   I was about 1.3 miles from the pickup location if anyone is curious about that. The hotel itself was in a great location and staff was amazing.  My only gripe was them cutting off our hotel room access at 1: 40 PM when they told us the  checkout time was 2:00 PM. Quick fix was talking to them and getting the hotel key activated. But I feel like you should of you just waited.   Overall, I thought it was a great experience and the rate charged was very affordable considering the location.",3

The executive lounge is quite large and offered substantial food and drink offerings in the evening. I had a great time lounging and watching the Australian Open Men's Final. Breakfast the next morning was on-point and offered anything and everything one could want or need. The gym was quite large and had substantial weights and machines for a very good workout. Checkout was a breeze...the bell-boys even had the right wrench to fix my aging luggage. The shuttle to and from HKG airport was quick and efficient. I had a perfect experience at this hotel.",3

We were upgraded to a suite and also had access to  Club Millésime.  The service  and facilities at the Club was exceptional. We utilized the Club facilities a few times during our stay and the service, food and drinks were exceptional.  The entire staff was amazing but I would like to especially mention Natalia and Luis. They were warm, friendly and went out of their way to make our experience memorable.  This was a couples trip but we will definitely be bringing our kids back to Mexico City.

Apart from totally loving Miami, I must say the staff at the front desk Danielle  is a super woman. She honestly worked hard to ensure our extended stay was amazing. I first thought she was apart of management because she was super sweet. I knew she was wonderful when I heard people whispering on how amazing her customer service skills were.

The Viking Museum is just down the street, and the meeting spot for the Sandeman's Free Walking Tour is minutes away too. We stayed 4 nights, the first was a one bedroom, which was OK in terms of comfort and space for the 2 of us and looked just like the pictures, but our unit had some issues so we were fortunate to get switched to a 2 bedroom, which was just fantastic. I'd requested a unit on the back street and that was perfect for a quiet night's sleep. One of the pleasures of staying here was the staff - so helpful and friendly and someone is there 24/7 if you need something. Super stay, highly recommend!",3
42452,Beautiful Hotel very friendly service housekeeping service is excellent. Thank you to Mr Ramszy supervisor for housekeeping and Ahmed for the wonderful service they provide and looking after our room. Will definitely be staying at the Marriott again !,3

52887,We stayed here for one night to visit the Olympic Park.   The rooms were lovely and clean with plenty of space .  The food was amazing too along with a very nice selection for breakfast. The staff were very polite and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Easy access to tube station up the road about a 10 minute walk.  Parking is minimal so book it when booking room.  Noise outside at night if you're a light sleeper.  Definitely stay here again .,3
53509,"The room is spacious and clean. The kitchen is good. The bed is better with comfortable mattress. Surrounding with 24 hr. restaurant and 7/11. By the way, it is a little bit too far from MRT and bus station. The price is reasonable",3
7134,"Amazing and nice place in the heart of Bangkok. 10 min. Walk to Kao San and all the attractions nearby. You can go by boat on a nice river trip, you can hire a tilting or a taxi. And you always have real quite place to relax with clean and nice rooms. ",3
1603,"Stayed at this property for two nights in a standard Queen bedroom whilst attending an event at Excel London. Ideal location for that venue, being a 5-10 minute walk.  On-site car parking £15 per day, fairly limited number of spaces but I managed to find a space.  Very comfortable, well maintained room, all the expected toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities, safe and also pleasing a good number of plug sockets, some of which take USB-A cables as well.  Good selection of pillows. Air conditioning worked well, windows don’t open but that’s sensible given it’s location to roads and London City airport so the property was quiet, even being on first floor.  Good selection of food including buffet breakfast with hot and cold items of good quality and quantity, frequently replenished. Also pleasing the wide opening hours, for example 6am to 11am on weekends.  Ate dinner in the hotel lobby, fairly limited value but was tasty and reasonably price given standard and location of hotel.  Free wi-fi easy to access without registration and worked well.  As I have the Hilton app it’s possible to check in online before arrival choosing the room of your preference which I think is great.  I did try the digital key to access my room and corridor doors etc but sometimes it didn’t work so I would always just get normal room cards from reception just in case.  Likewise via the app easy to check out and drop key at the express check out box at reception without any delay.  Overall would definitely recommend and happily return again in the future.",3
30033,"It is always a Pleasure to be back at this beautiful hotel , facing the River and Icon Siam.

63545,"This hotel is one of Santorini’s best kept secrets. It’s perfect for relaxing away from the crowded and noisy hotels in Fira and Oia.  I booked the standard double room with the common terrace which provided gorgeous views of the caldera and the sunset. The room itself had been recently renovated, and it showed. It was stylish, with delightful details, quiet, absolutely spotless and a very comfortable bed. PRO TIP: for free breakfast, book the room through the hotels website instead of booking.com. It includes orange juice, fresh breads, croissants, eggs, greek yogurt, granola, local honey and more. Just a delicious treat brought to our room every morning.   The staff were super friendly and kind, they always provided excellent customer service. Shoutout to the amazing manager, Andreas! Listen to him: he knows the island inside out and will give you the best recommendations on what to visit or where to eat. His help and professionalism made our stay that much better.  After sunset, some nights we would walk to the neighbouring Megalochori, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. It’s a beautiful traditional village, with cute little paths, and an excellent choice of restaurants (we highly recommend Alisachni!), shops and activities like cooking lessons (we had a great with Dina at Petra Kouzina). Other nights we’d stay in and eat by the pool, taking in the views and the romantic atmosphere given off by the candles.  We rented a car to visit Fira and Oia and the archeological site in Akrotiri (make sure to download the Akrotiri Audio Guide app if you do, very helpful and informative) and to go the different beaches. After a hot day, it was a pleasure to come back to the Grand View for a cocktail watching the breathtaking sunset.  All in all out stay at the Grand View was outstanding and we will definitely will be coming back!",3
8233,"Probably the coolest place to stay in Prague:-) The staff were all super friendly and helpful. The location is great, walkable to everywhere. The lobby is very modern and well designed. The apartment was lovely with great amenities, comfy beds, modern furnishings and a nice view. The apartment was very quiet and one was not at all bothered by the hustle and bustle of the town. When next in Prague we will return!!",3
50737,"We were privileged to spend 10 days at the Taj Fishermen’s Cove and enjoyed every minute of it. The friendly staff, a top room in the main building, the pool - everything was perfect. The food - whether the buffet in the Seagull restaurant or the à la carte menu or a special dish prepared by the chef Tapan Sahoo, was very tasty.  Albeit the hotel has been in existence for many years, it has been very well maintained and kept up to a very high standard.  The GM has been very visible and often around, but has never been intrusive, but was very open to a discussion if approached. The afternoon tea offered by the hotel has become a daily routine and made a nice break between pool time and dinner.",3
3689,"The stay was really nice mostly thank to the staff very friendly, useful and respectful. The rooftop and the pool are really a plus. The localisation is great close to the airport with the metro. The rooms could have a little more clean but the overall was really appreciated.",3

24104,"Great stay, probably most welcoming staff ever met in a hotel. Fast check in, gift from the hotel manager for the kids for CNY. Good location and super clean, great choice for both families, singles or business people. Rooms are big enough and all needed there and as said clean  ",3
11077,"Amazing warm welcome, spotlessly clean, very stylish but homely.  Our room was  a good size, the Indian restaurant onsite is exceptional.  Really authentic Indian cooking, beautifully served.  Staff were so polite, nothing was too much trouble. Anna was lovely at breakfast, genuinely friendly and warm.  Great breakfast.  Elvis was very friendly in reception area.    Great location, 5 mins walk from the V&A and Natural History Museum.  I cant wait to return",3
54074,"We arrived late a night on this charming hotel, after a long flight, but the check in process was easy, quick and very friendly.  We stayed for 7 nights, and were very pleased with the hotel, specially the convinient location and the servive, always eager to help.  The rooms are clean, silent, and the bathrooms very good (good hot shower on cold winter days). The TV has only korean channels.  The breakfast in good value, if only the same everyday.  Overall I would surely recommend this hotel for its value, location and friendly service.",3
6724,"Great Location, Nice Alcove private room. Complimentary Tea Coffee all the time.  Hotel has a small sitting lounge at the end of the building. Gives an impression of excellent space management.  Rooms are too small even for solo travelers.",3
49077,"My husband and I absolutely love staying at the Palace Resorts in Cancun Mexico. We have been members for years and most recently added the Elite status to our membership.  The service and the surroundings are 5+ star. We invited a couple of our friends to join us there as we celebrated my husband’s belated birthday and our first trip out of the country since COVID . We generally stay at  the Moon Sunrise but we decided to stay at Moon Palace the Grand. We chose the Grand because the individual, Lucia Barradas, who was the Public Relations Director at the Sunrise for years, is now the Public Relations Director at the Grand and we wanted to see her.  Lucia Barradas is absolutely wonderful and passionate about ensuring that individuals staying at the resort have a positively wonderful experience as well Fatima who ensured that anything that we may have needed was addressed while Lucia was on vacation.  We are so proud of Lucia being recognized for her service in excellence and being promoted over to the Grand Resort. On this occasion I was food challenged in that I am on a strict low/no sodium diet. No sugar etc. I brought my spices with me. I was so concerned, however, everyone at the various restaurants were so accommodating.  Once I made them aware that my preference was for them to cook my order with my own species, the chef would do so and come out afterwards to make sure I was happy.  Now that’s a vacation. The Grand is so large you really have to get around by way of golf cart like vehicles.  The Grand has pick up service throughout the resort constantly picking you up and taking you to the various restaurants and venues on the resort and the staff was so accommodating.  It was so nice to get away and have individuals dedicated to making your experience a happy one given everything that is going on in the world.  I want to give a shout out to again to Lucia, and Fatima in Public Relations Fatima was excellent, Angel, Angelo, Pedro, Carlos, Dedos, Michelle, Maximum and Jesus at Los Tacos one of our favorite hang outs and Luz at  the Grand Buffet.  We did not get to all the restaurants and they have so many as well as you have access to their other resorts.  Lastly it is a playground for entertainment for all.  I cannot say enough about it. Both my husband and I felt safe in our surroundings and at home. I would recommend that if considering where to go where the weather is great, the people are friendly and you need to be pampered and appreciated go to Cancun Mexico and stay at the Moon Palace The Grand  Cancun, which is now my favorite.  However, the other adjacent properties are really nice as well, which are a part of the Palace Resorts properties. You definitely get your monies worth and the world of all-inclusive is redefined and brought to the level of excellence in quality and service not generally found elsewhere.  I will definitely go back within the next year, God willing.  Please be sure to take your mosquito repellent, those “you can’t see ums” will sneak up on you. ",3
19503,"The hotel was clean and comfortable, staff were extremely helpful at all times.

27109,"We stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to Barcelona and our stay was absolutely amazing - the hotel definitely deserves it's great reviews. The check-in was brilliant, and we were made to feel ever so welcome by the young lady on the front desk, she also gave us a helpful tour of the hotel and some guidance on nearby places to visit. The room was amazing - very clean, modern and comfortable - even had dressing gowns & slippers! The shower was probably the best one I've ever experienced in a hotel & the toiletries provided were good quality. The rooftop bar is also very impressive with lots of seating to enjoy a drink while taking in the views of the city.",3
35524,"Had a trip to Rome with my girlfriend and we chose this hotel based on its proximity to the city and sights. However, the rooms and the hospitality exceeded my expectations. Huge rooms with a fantastic shower. Nice shades and furnishings and an overall sense of good taste. All the reception staff was very helpful and really gave us tips to go around Rome and for that matter, around Italy",3

46644,"I have stayed at many different hotels, bed and breakfasts, apartments, and villas in Rome and Villa Matissa is by far my favorite.  Silvio and his family are gracious hosts, the rooms are modern and clean, and the location is excellent. Trastevere can get noisy, especially at night, which is fun when you are a part of the action but not fun when you need some rest. Villa Matissa is perfectly situated to be close to the action and all sorts of transportation options, yet absolutely secluded and quiet. If you stay, make sure to visit their GORGEOUS garden and have your breakfast there.  I go to Rome for work once or twice a year and I only stay at Villa Matissa. Kudos to Silvio and Monica for being such gracious hosts and maintaining a beautiful property in Rome. ",3
63853,"This is the first time I visit İstanbul. I searched over the internet before we came there to choose the Hotel I stay and it's worth all the time I have spent on the computer:) The Hotel was so wonderful as in the pictures. The rooms are even bigger...Our room was so clean as I expected, the terrace where the breakfast is served had a great view...Esp.in the evenings... Breakfast was so satisfiying even for me who is so hunger in the mornings:) The location is at the heart of İstanbul, Beyoglu, very close to the public transportation, we easily reached to the historical places. Deniz, owner, was so hospitable to us, always recommended the best places to eat in İstanbul. I strongly advice you to stay in this beatiful Hotel, never miss that chance:)",3
12224,My daughter and I met in San Fran for a quick 3 days.  Chose this hotel for the name and was so impressed with it.  Great location.  Clean and modern.  Amazingly friendly staff.  Would definitely stay there again.,3
16537,"I personally think this is one of the best hotels in Fira! Really cute hotel, clean rooms and friendly staff. Short walk into town, market around the corner for drinks, snacks, fresh breakfast pastries and coffee. Bed was comfortable and it has a nice pool and spa (separate locations) although the spa was not heated. Quiet and relaxing stay, definitely recommend!!!",3

38101,Lovely decor and ambiance is boho. Great staff and very hospitable. It’s few minutes from the Main Street so you get some peace and quite. Their herbal tea was very refreshing. The room is very functional and good use of space. Highly recommend if you’re staying in Bangkok,3
22297,Beautiful hotel. Great location near the Duomo and Galleria. Friendly and helpful staff. The concierge helped us plan our two days in Milan which was quite helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.,3
10608,"Dated rooms and fixtures with minor issues. Zero frills. The shower was spacious and in good order, the bed was reasonably comfortable. The hallway could use a good vacuuming but the room itself was very clean and quiet other than traffic that is beyond anyone's control. The location across from Grant Park was nice. We had a corner room with a nice view. I loved all the windows but they did make the room very warm in the mornings. Luckily the AC worked like a champ. If you don't need much from a hotel other than a cool place to sleep and a good shower, this is very budget friendly and a good enough place to stay. ",3
33737,"Veriu at Broadway has become a home away from home when travelling to Sydney for work.  I enjoy it that much I have also stayed for a non work trip.  Timo and the team genuinely want you to have a lovely stay.  They make a real effort to make you feel welcome and that you have what you need.  The rooms are modern, spacious, with an industrial vibe and I’ve stayed in a few different layouts.  The beds are very comfortable and I appreciate the super white bed linen and towels, very fresh.   There are great features like a washer and dryer, which is useful particularly when you are travelling.  The kitchen is modern with both a gas cook top and electric oven, a family sized fridge, a dish washer, a coffee machine, and I love the green tea.  And for the nights you can’t be bothered cooking, you can ring down to reception and they will order your food from offsite and deliver it to your room, with the convenience of it being charge to your room. However, if you want, you can also walk about 5mins to Broadway shopping centre for lots of choice with food and shopping in general.  The wifi is fast and I love the Netflix setup on the tv. Thanks heaps for making the stays so easy and enjoyable.",3

13508,"We’ve been staying here for about 15-20 years and have stayed at the hotel at least 20 times. It is consistently fabulous. The hotel staff are very attentive and helpful. The breakfast is simple but delicious. A typical French breakfast incl. yoghurt and fruit, croissants, cold meat, cheese and bread with coffee and juice. The rooms are small but adequate, with lots of natural light. The 3 night rate is always attractive. Close proximity to Bon Marche, the metro, cafes, restaurants and not that far the river, the Champs Elysee and other attractions. The foyer has been upgraded and looks fantastic. They will progressively upgrade the rooms. I hope the upgrade doesn’t push the room rate up too high because this is a hotel I want to stay at for the next 20 years. Free wi-fi. Highly recommended.",3
14300,We stayed here for 4 Nights at the end of October. We loved our time in Istanbul Hotel is close to Taksim Square close to loads of nice food and desserts shops and close to metro station as well. Hotel is in quiet street which is good if you have little kids breakfast is decent and staff were very friendly as well we have two kids all the staff were very nice  and helpful with them. Every floor has its own WiFi network so that's a positive as well. If we go again then we will definitely stay here its a nice hotel .Overall brilliant experience in Istanbul.,3

41970,"This was a great find  - a beautifully decorated room with hand painted features, quaint light fittings, and well furnished.    Loved the old style lift with gate to close.  Receptionist could not have been more helpful with advise on exploring SF.  Hotel felt extremely Covid safe.   Breakfast if ordered the night before, was boxed up individually for you to collect, or eat in their small cafe.  Croissant, yogurt, fruit and juice.  Tea and coffee available.  Definitely would return to this gem of a hotel - full of character and French styling.",3
51951,"I had a weekend trip with my boyfriend to Hangzhou for a Trail Run event. After all the tiredness I had experienced from the race, we pampered ourselves well in this lovely hotel. I met a staff Alice Tong in the hotel who is also a running fan and participated in the same run who even won the female No.1 trophy. Following her recommendation, I tried the jacuzzi in health club. It is the right comfort I needed after four hours of workouts. Highly recommend their Hangzhou IPO (seasonal signature osmanthus draft beer) from their brewery which reminds me the scent of city in this season. Cheers to friend whom I haven’t met for a while in the evening is surely another highlight of the day! Love the food we had there too. We will return soon!!",3

14818,My family and I book two rooms for 9 nights. We really had a pleasnt stay in PARK PLAZA. I really could feel Ms.Nina and Ms.Alexandra tried their best to give best services to my family and all guests.  Thank you very much . ,3
7034,Our family had a fantastic stay for 5 nights in January. Great value and fantastic service with a special mention to Philip on the front counter. He sent my daughter a fruit basket at the end of our first day after I had told him it was her first time in Sydney. He also happily moved us to another room when our A/C was not working properly.  Truly a great experience and my new place to stay in Sydney.,3
780,"The outdoor breakfast room has a relaxed atmosphere with plants and greenery.  Additionally, the breakfast staff were very friendly and provided terrific service. The rooftop garden and pool had wonderful views and it was enjoyable to spend time up there. The room was neat and clean. Chinatown and Clark Quay is within walking distance of the hotel and the access to trains and buses is excellent. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.",3
16567,"Booked this wonderful little place after finding it on booking.com several months ago. We wanted to spend a couple of nights in Santorini as hadn't been here for nearly 10 years and am so glad we found the Galatia Villas. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome by the wonderful owners. The room that we had was away from the main block and was perfectly adequate and comfortable for our stay. Air conditioning was very good and the room also has a mini fridge. I also loved the pieces of art in the room.  We used the roof top terrace with the jacuzzi on our first afternoon and also spent a couple of hours relaxing at the pool. Breakfast is plentiful and I was surprised at how much you get. It is about a 10 minute walk into the centre of Fira which was not a problem for us, but if you have mobility issues please be aware that it is uphill. All in all highly recommended and would stay here again.",3
58783,"We hadnt even planned to go to djerba and had this place recommended by a kind man in our shared taxi, and it was great!  Its winter so we could use the pool but theres lots of fun events and activities still on the resort. Views were beautiful, rooms were lovely, food and drink plentiful. No coffee or tea in the rooms but they hve in resort as early as 3 am.  And the staff was amazing. The guys at the desk went above and beyond to make thd next leg of our journey exactly what we wanted! Thank you guys very much! ",3
19489,"This hotel is so ideal, it is exactly where you need to be sight seeing. There is some hills to approach the hotel. But it is doable. The hotel is spotless with no issues and was so helpful with tourist attraction booking.   I will never forget the lady on the bar on the rooftop bar on 19/05 who was present and took photos to me and my partner becoming engaged. She went above and beyond to make this so special. She took photos, and congratulated us. I’d like to thank her so much for making it so special and we will never forget her, I am gutted I never got her name. Thank you for you been present on the day I’ll never forget. Rome will always have a special place in my heart and hotel colosseum will be the a part of my trip I’ll never forget so thank you",3
33637,"First, the hotel is very new. It is just a few minutes walk from Gotanda Station. Most convenient amongst the hotels that I have stayed - one doesn't have to walk down or up lots of stairways inside/outside stations unlike many hotels that I had stayed before, though are also very close to railway stations but they are comparatively larger and more complicated.  The shower pressure is one of the best. Most impressive of all, the air conditioning is really maneuverable, unlike many of the hotels in Japan.  Another pro is that the supermarket annexed to Gotanda Station operates until midnight.  If you wish to rent a car for day trip like I had done, this hotel is perfect as car rental is just about two hundred meters away so you don't have to worry finding a carpark for the night, which is always expensive in downtown Tokyo.",3
49842,"We stayed at Melia in November (perfect time to visit Athens) and we were happy with our choice for the location and of course the services. The room was very good, the breakfast too, the hotel stuff very helpful.  The roof terrace has a spectacular view of Akropolis and there you can relax with a glass of wine or something admiring the view of Pantheon or Lycabettus Hill. The location of the hotel in excellent, Omonoia Square is 3 minutes walk, also can have a nice walk to Syntagma Square,  Akropolis, Plaka or Monastiraki, all that small specific streets, 30 minutes to Kallimarmaro Stadium. Take a rest on a terrace for a good coffee, or a bier and then at the end of the day walk back to the hotel, placed in the middle of all good things. It was a pleasure to stay in Melia and all the time when is possible we choose this brand and  we are never wrong. next time in Athens, for sure we'll stay again here.",3

58044,"The hotel was beautiful and the room was lovely, very well appointed and smelled clean. The bed was rather firm for me personally but others might not agree.   Breakfast was very tasty and had a good selection of items.   The front desk staff was 50/50, some excellent and others rather cold, especially one young gentleman who looked at me like I was crazy when I asked a few questions. He could have politely smiled and said he wasn’t sure. The bellmen were very friendly and personable.   The location of the hotel was excellent for proximity to the station and the major sites.   I would recommend the Grandium based on the deal I got for the room. It was a last minute booking and I was pleased with my choice.",3

24753,Room is small. A bit old. But their front desk service is highly appreciated. They will call you everyday and see what you need. A greeting in your quarantine days is warming your heart. They even sent me a gift to celebrate my quarantine stay at their hotel. Thank you Queenie for your kind help!,3
19265,"We stayed at the Palm Gallery for 2 nights in October 2022.  We had a room on the first floor with a private terrace.  There is lots of storage for clothing in this room.  Water pressure and hot water was excellent.  There was a mini fridge in the room -fyi the water in the fridge is not included but not overpriced. There is a hotel bar so it's handy if you want a drink including good coffee.  There is a hotel terrace where anyone can sit, and it was nice meeting other guests.  The staff is very helpful and always nice and all spoke English.  Due to our plans, we weren't able to have breakfast at the hotel, but it looked good (wasn't included in our rate).  This is in a residential area so the street is not busy with traffic. We walked to the hotel from the Rome Termini station, and it was OK but next time I will take a taxi to avoid the hassle of walking with luggage (carryon and backpack).  We walked to the main tourist area and it is about a 40 minute walk.  There is a grocery store nearby if needed. There are restaurants nearby too.  The taxi ride to the airport cost us $57 euros just so you know. If I ever go back to Rome and wanted a hotel not in the main tourist area I would stay here again in the same room and recommend it to my friends and family.",3
41311,"This is a nice hotel with a great location. It’s right on the beach. There are 2 heated pools (separate for kids/families) with full service bar/food.

She upgraded me to a nicer room, made sure me and my dog felt at home, and was super kind to my parents when they called in for me because my phone was dying without power. Thank you for letting me check in early, stay late, and for showing me so much kindness. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else even if I had millions. Thank you so much to your team here!",3
28614,"This hotel was perfect , easily walkable to the Blue Mosque and Topkapki Palace. A little difficult to find so be sure to get good directions from the hotel. Rooms were good and the views from the breakfast terrace were excellent. They were really good when i realised i had booked an extra night by mistake and they never charged us. All round a pretty good hotel !",3
48274,"I have stayed here for a number of years now. This year, I have particularly impressed by a few thoughtful services- Icy cold water after a day out, luggage service beyond the duration of my stay, and tax refund information. Staff are always very friendly and helpful. If I may point out one thing to improve, it is the room cleaning time. They came in to clean at around 6 pm when I came back from outing.",3

Big thank you to Anja on the  operations team for the continued above and beyond service and special thanks to Clint David Thomas and cole in the valet team for always making me feel like I’m visiting home!  If you are a repeat traveler, the archer goes above and beyond to make your trip special and fun (I have a new celebrity photo in my room each visit for laughs and the valet crew has the car ready with no wait, water and ac on every morning.   If you’re traveling for fun the location is ideal. ",3

Special thanks to the hostel employee Simone, who settled my daughter in a great place and with good conditions.  I am happy for my daughter and will recommend this wonderful place to our friends.",3
63844,"You can't go wrong staying here. It is by far one of the best places we've booked. Our hostess was charming and very focused on making sure we had a wonderful stay. She provided maps, tips and went so far as to walk us through that area of town the night we arrived on her way home. She also helped us with a tour company we'd booked when they didn't want to come to our hotel to pick us up.   The hotel / B&B is in a great location, close to a pedestrian area and shopping, as well as the Galata Tower. We found it very easy to get around from there. Our room was very spacious and had a bay window; the bath was modern and large. Towels and linens were lush and plentiful.   Breakfast was up on the terrace or across the street at a related hotel. The food was excellent at both, we enjoyed the variety offered.    You'll be very happy if you select Dila Suites for your stay. ",3
42622,"After having to disembark from our cruise early yesterday we arrived at 8 a.m. to Bar B&B. They held our luggage while we walked down to the beach and rented the city bikes to ride the path & see the area. Charlie gave us a small map & pointers as where to eat and what to avoid so we didn't get caught up in the tourist exploitation. He even called us when our room was ready. The bed was super comfy and we slept amazing for about 10 hrs! We awoke to coffee & tea on the patio along with yogurt w/ granola & fruit....then made to order yummy omelets! Charlie  even helped load our suitcases into our Uber car this morning. Carlos was the evening host who also seemed very friendly & helpful. However, we crashed hard after we returned from an evening Bay tour. We will definitely return to Bar B&B for our next Miami visit!",3
12419,"This is a small, clean, friendly run hotel which is situated perfectly to start your visit in Athens. Close to Syntagma Square, but on a relatively quiet street parallel to Ermou Street, you can walk to all relevant and interesting places. Close to Plaka and Monastiraki Square and a perfect view of the Acropolis when sitting on the terrace for breakfast. Highly recommended and good value for the money!",3

63894,"Words cannot describe our stay at Dila Suites, incredible in every sense of the word. Where to begin..........the property is outstanding, beautiful, comfortable, impeccably clean and very spacious. The location is excellent, close to everything, only steps to restaurants, shopping, transit, etc., you simply could not ask for a better location.   The daily breakfast was fabulous and was a great time to sit and exchange stories of our adventures with other guests. It was a very intimate setting which we very much enjoyed. The big plus was the rooftop patio which offered an idyllic view of Istanbul at a wonderful vantage point.  The most AMAZING part for us was both Deniz and Ali, the owners of Dila Suites. We have NEVER come across more gracious, kind and warm people. No matter what we needed they went out of their way to accommodate us. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with Deniz and Ali, many thanks for a wonderful two weeks it was simply amazing because of you! Until next time........sonsuza dek değil Şimdilik hoşçakal.",3

14668,"We have been going to Edsa Shangrila for family staycations for a long time now. It's our whole family's favorite quick getaway. We feel most comfortable and taken cared of at Edsa Shangrila.   Our kids especially love swimming in the pool. We would like to give a special shout out to Sir Manny (lifeguard) for chatting with our 2 boys from time to time and for always keeping our kids safe while swimming. Thank you too to Sir Oteph Silvan, lifeguard for taking care of us.   For my husband and I, we enjoy having drinks and peanuts at the Pool Bar made relaxing and easy with the impeccable service headed by Mavic and the whole Pool Bar team, Chef Anthony and Nikki!   Of course, the whole stay won't be complete without experiencing dining at The Heat. We are most at home with our friends at Heat namely, Kap Mike Cifra, Angelica Banal, Stephen Manuel, Vergel Siason, and of course with Chef Anthony Catipay.  Special shout out too to Luigi Bautista, Service Associate from guest service center who always took care of our Heat dining reservations and for the care he has has given us during our stay.  Thank you too to Sheryl Meneses for her attention to details in keeping our rooms so clean and comfy.  Edsa Shangrila is definitely a place we call home because of the great accommodations and the excellent service of people who work there that have become our good friends as well. We'll definitely be back because of them. ",3
9475,"A short walk from the central train terminal, which we used from Florence. Front desk was welcoming and friendly. They were extremely helpful recommending restaurants off the tourist track—3/3 winners. Rooftop bar had great views and excellent (but expensive) drinks. The room was decent sized and well appointed. Housekeeping was very good. The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was that 2 times we asked for wake-up calls, but didn’t get them! Fortunately, we used our phones as backup. Before our last night, we happened to speak with the night manager about the problem and he assured us that he would come through for us—and he did. I would return here.",3

35486,"First visit to Rome and when I return I will be staying here again. Checking in took all of a minute, absolutely no dramas. Staff very polite and friendly. We were told if we needed anything we only had to ask and this promise was kept on numerous occasions.  Our room was just what  we needed ie a base to venture out and see the sights. It was very clean, plenty of room and cool as the  ( free ) a/c was on. Room was cleaned on a daily basis. It was also very quiet. The location was great as its not on top of all the sights but in a position where you can easily take a leisurely walk to them or get the metro which is a pretty short walk away. The area has cafes/restaurants so you can take your pick. We used the rooftop bar a couple of times and it is really laid back and soothing after a day of seeing what Rome has to offer. Again, the bar is immaculately clean and the staff will leave you  alone or have a chat depending how busy it is. I would like to thank the management for having such a great place. But the place only works because of your wonderful staff so thank you to Cecilia,Renato and Alissia in reception and Daniel, Giorgio,Nicolo and Alissandro in the bar.  I hope I spelled your names correctly if not I apologise. Thanks for having us and we shall be looking to revisit in the near future.  In summary, just book this place. You wont regret it.",3

11815,"Ari & Adrian were the best hosts while waiting for our table on the rooftop. If you’re not feeling like waiting more than an hour to go to the rooftop - the Lobby Bar at Sofitel is the best option.  Don’t leave without trying the mezcal flight, they all good, my favorite was “The lost explorer” that Adrian was so kind to recommend me.",3
64090,My sister and I visited Athens for the first time and we were very impressed with the Divani Caravel. We received a COVID friendly reception and were fortunate to be upgraded to an executive room. The hotel was quiet but that was to be expected and the restaurant was closed however 24 hour room service could be arranged if wished.  We ate out locally and there were plenty of restaurants to choose from. Highly recommend the rooftop pool and bar having enjoyed Cosmopolitans overlooking the Acropolis and Parthenon at dusk when the sunset was magnificent and were able to see the lights switch on at the Acropolis.  Would return again as Divani Caravel was located in a good location. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom spacious with plentiful supplies of toiletries.   Thank you for a wonderful stay would have no hesitation in returning.,3
49071,"We have just spent 11 nights at The Grand, Moon Palace for our honeymoon and had a fantastic time. This isn’t the type of trip we would usually go for, but the resort was recommended to us and, as it was a special occasion, we decided to really indulge and have a relaxed holiday.  It is clear on arrival that The Grand is really a place for money and indulgence and the theme carried throughout the holiday. From the luxury room to the restaurant service, concierges at the pool and room service, everything you could want is at your fingertips (see below re. app).  The room itself was beautiful, lots of space, plenty of storage and a gorgeous whirlpool bath which was a perfect distraction for the occasional early thunderstorm. The mini-bar was kept stocked daily with soft drinks and snacks and of course, your very own spirit dispenser with rum, gin, tequila and vodka.  It was mostly American guests… I think we came across a total of 4 other British couples/families while we were there. Being our first time in Mexico, I couldn’t comment if that’s the norm but everyone we directly spoke to was very friendly and just there to enjoy the glorious sunshine and exceptional service.   With 11 nights to utilise, I thoroughly researched before we went. I highly recommend downloading the Palace Resorts app, where you can see all restaurants and their menus beforehand and, once you arrive you can link the app to your booking and use it to make reservations/order room service. Knowing of this before we travelled helped to make sure we sampled as many of the bars and Al a Carte restaurants as we could. Most highly recommended are:  -	Tapas y Vino – the perfect way to start your evening. It’s the first bar you come to as you enter the Lobby from most golf carts… bitesize tapas to get your evening started (our trip was in May/June so thunderstorms meant we retired to our room to get ready and head out around 6 when our meal was booked for 9pm)  -	Habibi – I overheard a lot of Americans saying they had never tried Lebanese food before, which surprised me. This restaurant has a large menu of sharing plates (mezzes) much like Greek or Turkish and we loved almost every dish we tried. We went once for evening meal and on another occasion for lunch. The only complaint I had was that the Tabbouleh was too salty, but I suppose that’s my fault for ordering salad on holiday!  -	Cusco (breakfast) – we didn’t go for lunch and the evening meal wasn’t our favourite (probably down to our choices). But breakfast is much quieter than the Grand Buffet, had pretty much the same offerings and the service was outstanding.   -	Le Chateau (adults only) – service was impeccable, a real treat, especially for a couple on honeymoon. Welcome drinks, bottles of wine for the table, exquisite food and a surprise dessert we didn’t order to enhance our celebrations. We went back for our final night, it was so good. I would highly recommend the duck or entrecote for mains.  - The Library (adults only) - the speakeasy bar, located downstairs is ""hidden"" behind the bookcase (not very well hidden as the door was almost constantly open)... They have a great selection of cocktails and if nothing on the menu takes your fancy, they will make whatever your heart desires.  The Boulangerie has a huge array of sandwiches, cakes, crepes and ice creams, as well as hot and cold drinks. We had a couple of trips booked which left very early in the morning - we picked up a couple of sandwiches the night before as we didn't have time for breakfast.  Unfortunately, there were groups of what I could only describe as “middle-aged frat boys” who were unnecessarily loud (considering we were in the “up market” part of the resort) and several spoiled teenagers who were drunk and very disrespectful to staff; and being honest, their parents were exactly the same (I was embarrassed for them!) We avoided these people mostly throughout the holiday, but when we did encounter them, it made me so angry. The staff handled this immaculately and they are absolute saints for this! All I can say is, if you’re reading this and this was you; please learn basic manners! Don’t shout at staff who are doing their best to attend to your every want and need and be mindful that there are couples and families around you, trying to enjoy their meals.  Special mentions for:  -	Laura @ Tapas y Vino -	Martin @ Cusco (breakfast) -	Nesto – Le Chateau -	Jesus – Unique Day Club -	Chris – The Pub (Nizuc)  Honestly, all of the staff were incredible, but those mentioned served us multiple times, for the majority of our stay at The Grand. They really got to know us, and we hope we got to know them a bit more than the average guest.  Although technically your tips are included in the cost of your stay, a little extra is greatly appreciated by the staff, as in all hospitality jobs around the world.",3
15256,"The resort is amazing ! The staffs are really friendly and helpful! The food is amazing even we mainly eat breakfast at the resort ! The kids club is great.

41656,"The location was perfect, between Fira and Imerovigli, away from crowds and noise. The views are stunning and management is very accommodating. I had communicated with them before arrival and arranged airport and port transfers, as well as a private tour of the island. They were responsive and all worked out beautifully.  We arrived before the room was ready and we were referred to a nearby restaurant which was just what we needed. I only missed not having a pool one afternoon when we were tired and it was hot and a pool would have been nice but we weren’t expecting it and just sitting in the balcony enjoying the stunning view was enough relaxation. Chrisoula , Nikki , Mario and the gentleman who brought us breakfast every morning ( so sorry I didn’t get your name)  spoiled us. I would definitely return.",3

Not just the style the hotel also gives a homey feeling by their friendly and knowledgeable staff who speaks fluent English and other languages.

The location is very close to the Central Train station for trains coming in and out of the city (we took the bus from airport to the station) and close to the metro. I suggest getting a 1 or 3 day metro pass depending on how long you are here.  We were here for 2 days but got a 3 day pass.  Well worth it as the metro makes getting around the city so easy.   The breakfast at the hotel has everything you could ask for and all delicious.   At 5:00 you can go to the hotel bar for drinks that come complete with snacks.   I would highly recommend staying here.  ",3

11591,"I would like to rate this resort 5 stars but just can't and there is mainly one reason for that. Hotel grounds are really beautiful, all staff is super nice and friendly, food is good, location great and so on but there is one big problem. Really, really loud music that is on all day and most of the evening is quite irritating. We had this Deluxe sea view pool access suite which was really good choice but we would have loved to enjoy our nice view and sun in tranquility and just listen to birds and water flowing in the fountains of the pool but that didn't happen. It was actually hard to even have a conversation on the terrace since the noisy music. We understand well that there is music for example at the pool bar but what's the point to have loudspeakers on roof of the bar?? I wish I could add a video to clarify this... Same problem continues in restaurants, even at the breakfast. Type of music is more calm but volume is still far too high. It should be background music, not the noise that makes it hard to even talk to someone at the same table. I don't know... maybe some guests like that but we certainly didn't. We of course also noticed that there were many guests who spend only couple of nights here and then maybe you don't notice that they even play exactly the same music every day! But in two weeks it gets very tiresome. As I said there is so many good things in this resort that it's a shame that this one thing took so much out for the pleasure being there. Place is truly beautiful and location is nice near the beach and with many local restaurants and services nearby but still not too busy. And the best part was the hotel staff of course. We felt very welcomed immediately when we arrived, got escorted to our room and also got all the information we needed (thanks for that Kate). All the staff was really, really nice and helpful but our special thanks goes to restaurant manager Raju and our new dear friend in Thailand Fai, who served many delicious drinks and nice conversations for us at the roof top terrace<3 Finally we have one suggestion for the roof top terrace. Umbrellas for the tables could be a good idea. Terrace and view from there are great. It's a superb place also for watching the sunset but when the sun is still up it's ""quite warm"" up there.  So without this noisy music issue we could easily be back at Avista Grande...",3
5442,"We recently spent  5 nights in this hotel.  The room and bathroom were very comfortable and clean.  The best asset of this hotel is the staff.  They are unfailingly helpful, thoughtful and kind.  The consierge, Martin, helped us plan a trip to the Mara and Lake Naivasha.  He arranged transport, made bookings for us, helped us with covid tests and results, and was always there with a friendly smile.  The drivers including Frederick and Ben were experienced and helpful.  The hotel itself is in the CBD which is a slight distance from attractions in Nairobi, but the service and the comfort of this hotel make up for that.",3
26324,"As my very first hotel in Japan, the Swissotel Nankai Osaka hotel instantly stole my heart for both itself and the country. If you have ever been to Japan, you will know that most hotels, amenities, food, and hospitality are far superior to what we expect in America. After experiencing 5 different ones during my recent trip to Japan (which all made me feel like a princess), Swissotel Nankai Osaka was definietly one of the 2 that really WOWed me.   I stayed on the 24th floor in a Swiss Advantage Queen Room and the views were absolutely breathe-taking! I felt like I was some famous Embassy executive or something of the liking! The room itself was just as spectacular: a perfect size for 1-2 people (or 3-4 if you are all tiny like myself!), a spacious bathroom with a divine shower and lots of counter space, fantastic heating for the cold winter nights, a stocked mini-bar, a Nespresso machine (yes!), an extremely comfy bed that left me not wanting to get up each morning, and I mean, cmon, an unbeatable view!   I had the privilege of adding Executive Club features to my stay and LOVED having access to the Lounge. I would stop by every day, whether it be for breakfast or an afternoon/early evening rest. Food and drinks were always available, but I'm not talking your run-of-the-mill water, soda, crackers, corn nuts... No, I'm talking fresh fruit, an assortment of SWISS (!!) chocolate (which I over-indulged in every day and hoarded back to my room... shh.. you know Swiss chocolate is my weakness, and this was honestly some of the best I ever had...?!!?), hummus, vegetable crudités, nuts, exquisite cheeseboards, assorted tapas, little desserts, coffee, tea, and much more. Best of all, during the Evening Reception, a fantastic variety of unlimited alcohol- beer, wine, champagne, different vodkas, whiskeys, rums, and... even Bailey's! (which I cannot lie, I am also addicted to). If you can, I highly recommend this feature- especially if you plan on spending any time at the hotel other than to sleep. My colleague and I really enjoyed our relaxing moments at our favorite table in the Lounge, with an unbeatable 33th floor view of the city.  The service and amazing team will blow your mind. From the second you enter, you are greeted and taken care of. You can expect nothing but the best throughout your entire stay, which is extra helpful for those who do not speak English. Even though I was only there 3 short days, I was always greeted by a team member who seemed to remember/recognize me and ensure I was enjoying my stay and equipped with whatever I may need.   200000000 stars from me.",3

13032,"This small hotel is situated very close to Blue Mosque Haga Sophia Topkapi Palace and 10 min walk from tram.  An excellent hotel in an ideal location for seeing all the sights of this historical city The staff was extremely helpful, the rooms were cosy and clean, and the location was excellent. I had a very pleasurable experience staying in this hotel. Very clean and warm hotel, staff is very friendly and very helpful.

64017,"I loved Divani Caravel. The location has always been my favorite, the rooms were nice, some of them facing the Syggros hospital a bit dark but not something unbearable, the ones facing kolonali, excellent. The breakfast is the absolute highlight, one of the best I had. The gym another highlight, I enjoyed it every day. About the staff: 90% of the receptionists were amazing, there were a couple of senior guys at the reception, especially late at night that were kind of fed up with serving so they would put the least effort and from the housekeeping, some of the people were too persistent and at times rude, all depending on the person you deal with, again, 90% of them super friendly. The guys from restaurant in general very good. On other negative comments, the key card any time it touched my phone would be deactivated so I had to go to the reception every few hours to fix that. Overall I give a five star, the good things clearly outweigh the few grey spots. And sure I am returning",3
26931,"If you’re coming to Austin and you’re looking for a relaxing experience, absolutely stay at the Four Seasons Austin. The hotel is charming and like all Four Seasons we have stayed in, the service is impeccable. Absolutely wonderful!",3
38838,"Just had a wonderful stay at Prekas Apartments.  Staff is wonderful, very welcoming and helpful.  Stayed in the three person room with the large terrace and incredible view.  Room was clean and had everything we needed.  Would love to stay here again and found Imerovigli to be far less crowded and touristy than Fira and Oia, while having plenty of really good restaurants, plus two grocery markets for food, drink or other items you may need.",3
1156,"I agree with all positive opinions: the hotel is very comfortable, clean, the breakfast is good to start he day. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they can give you good advices about what to do and where to eat around. The hotel is located în an quier area where from you can easy walk to the old town. The roof terrace is great  for having  a coffee in morning or a beer in the evening after sightseeing. The Hotel Julian is an excellent basis for exploring Prague!",3
52689,Stayed for a night for work. Highly recommend the pizza was amazing. And the bar staff Chelsea and Paul were really friendly and great fun.   A great location bang in the city and close to all the sites and tube stations.   I will be back next time I come to London.,3

2170,"We stay 4 nights in this B&B and we realy love it. It was super close to the Coliseum (less than 10 minutes walking) and from the metro station. The room was very beautiful and spacious, we had breakfast delivered to room every morning and the owners were very kind and helpful. The best price/value relation. Our stay was definitely better than we expected.",3
2832,"The location and wonderful hotel staff are the reasons for 5 stars. If you like to walk, you can almost walk anywhere from here. We had a very short 24 hours in Paris so that our family all had time to arrive. The staff was amazing, so nice and helpful. We arrived before check in from an overnight flight and were just going to leave our luggage. Although the hotel is very small, they were able to work miracles and let us get in all three of our rooms. My husband and I had the largest room which was very spacious and had a very nice, modern bathroom and a very comfortable bed.  I think some of the rooms are much smaller and some do  not have air conditioning, but this is clearly stated on the room description. We had a very nice breakfast at the hotel in a lovely courtyard. This is not a modern, newly decorated hotel, but it is charming and very clean and accommodating. Plus you are in a fabulous neighborhood for an excellent price.",3
840,Really friendly staff including the lady who owns the hotel. The location was great near Darling Harbour and Central Station. We were given a complementary bottle of fizz for New Years Eve as well which was a nice touch.,3

5895,"The hotel was great- it's located 10 mins from termini central station (so easy to get there from the airport and no need to walk alot with your luggage), and from piazza della repubblica (so close to another metro station). The location was great because it's walking distance to everthing you want to see (I only took the metro to the vatican- you could also walk there, which I did on the way back when I had more time). There are also good restaurants, gelaterias and shops in the area (as it's located next to via nazionale and the opera house) and they are usually less expensive and crowded than those near famous sites (so I ate there almost every evening). I had a single room which was clean and had everything I needed (comfy bed, safe, hot water, wifi, etc.). The staff was really nice and helpful (they are there 24/7, and you can leave your luggage with them if you need), and the breakfast was good. I would definitely stay there again next time I visit! Thank you.",3
16719,"We must say we had one of the best hamburgers ever in Shenzhen areas. They were delicious, and we had the top swing manager to serve us too. Great feelings. Great job ! Later we went over to the beach and walked through the garden areas, really nice settings plus a relaxing mode all around us, pleasantly done on overall environmental design on the layout. Also check out the swimming pool! A good traveling experience here. ",3

22446,"Lucky to choose this hotel for our family (2 Adults and 2 boys ) Super comfortable, big , clean, good location and very helpful staff & concierge. From the moment we got down from KAL shuttle bus located along the main road in front hotel building, hotel concierge man came to help us the luggage ( especially in the -2 degC weather) Our Deluxe double room was big with king size bed and arm chairs that can joined up as a bed for teenage boy. Housekeeper observed it on 2nd day and gave us a extra blanket. Large bathroom with separate toilet, bathtub, stand shower and two sinks.  Most importantly link to LOTTE shopping mall and train station. And lots of yummy food and shopping within walking distance.

20146,"A wonderful oasis in the middle of busy, sometimes chaotic Athens. Excellent, friendly and efficient welcome. Very clean rooms and shared areas. Amazing breakfast served in wonderful surroundings. This is an excellent boutique hotel.",3
30911,Waterpark was amazing. There is a section for little kids only so no older kids can get in their way. The only thing is that they don't let all the kids in the big Waterpark we literally have to be in line to enjoy the big Waterpark. The lifeguards arnt really good my son was literally drowning in front of 1 of them. Because other children were playing rough in the water an 1 kid accidently backed up into my son without seeing him,3
33540,"We stayed for 5 nights and really enjoyed it - a good location on the third circle, within walking distance to downtown Amman (around 20 mins) & the popular dining precinct of Rainbow Street about 15 mins away. An easy 30 - 45 minute drive away from the airport depending on traffic. The facilities of the hotel were great, we used the hotel pool/spa facilities, breakfast restaurant and room service - it was busy during our stay with lots of tour groups and conferencing guests. We stayed in a Grand Double Room and it was decent sized with good bathroom facilities including separate bath/shower. They offer Hertz rentals as well as day tours to various parts of Jordan if you've not already pre-booked those, at competitive rates. For really good street food, try the shewarma shop that is at the second circle (staff will show you by map which way to walk, about 10 mins away). Service overall friendly and helpful - would definitely recommend for any first timer to Amman/Jordan.",3
42210,"There were apparently a lot of things going on in the area with a huge volleyball tournament and beauty pageant.  I was grateful to be able to get a room for the night we needed.  Staff is always welcoming and friendly, it was a short stay and we appreciated the check out extra hour extended us .",3

43988,Athens studio was great! Amazing location extremely walkable to cute shops and acropolis. Comes with free breakfast and a balcony. The room is nothing fancy but it does the job was clean and inexpensive. Would definitely stay here again!,3
52455,Was pleasantly surprised by this hotel considering it is rather unknown.   Location is good! Just a 3minute walk to the Daikokucho subway station and a 5minute walk to Namba station. Very accessible!   Breakfast buffet was excellent considering the size of hotel. Was expecting a small spread with poor quality. BUT I WAS SO WRONG. They were able to mix the traditional Japanese cuisine well with the standard western dishes.   They have a self-service laundromat if you will need to have a new set of clothes.   Will definitely book at this hotel when I go back to Osaka!   Tip: there's always fried chicken during breakfast! ,3
50275,Had a wonderful stay here. Clean and huge rooms and comfortable bed. The breakfast was really good and the location was ideally placed for my trip (also closed to the metro station) The staff is welcoming and helpful. Thanks! ,3
58538,"Perfect Hotel for a short weekend in Warsaw, with a real nice location near the city centre and with very nice equipment for relaxation (perfect swimming pool and sauna) Rich and nice breakfast in a nice dining room ",3
29103,"This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Its location, at the foot of the Charles Bridge, is ideal. We could easily walk into the Old Town as well as to the Prague Castle. The rooms are surprisingly spacious and quite comfortable. But what made our visit special was the reception staff -- friendly, professional, helpful and kind. When we didn't know where to park our car, a staffer left the desk and rode in our car to show us. They happily and efficiently made restaurant reservations and organized private airport transport for us. One extra benefit of staying at Pod Vezi: a free ticket to the top of the bridge tower. ",3
10558,"The hotel is positioned perfectly for easily walking to tourist destinations and is fantastic quality for the price. With the exception of the complimentary breakfast, which was somewhat limited in variety and flavor, I was extremely satisfied with my stay.",3

7027,"I stayed at the Novotel with my husband & 5 year old daughter. The staff were so accommodating and were always happy to help. The room was spotless, the beds were super comfy and the pool was heated to protection.   We had buffet breakfast each morning and it was delicious. We also had dinner in the restaurant and the steak was cooked beautifully.   They have a kids retreat in the lobby. It was nice to relax while our daughter played with the dolls house & watched a movie.   Great location! Only a 15min walk to Darling Harbour.   We will be back for sure!",3
34083,"The location of the hotel is very nice as it’s just within the Taikoo place in the heart of the city. Buffet lunch at Ebony was impressive - a wide variety of offerings nicely presented, accessible to natural daylight, the main courses are incredible.",3
54005,"its good hostel. but you need to walk a little to go to the center of the tokyoThe party that is held every weekend is very interesting.Also, there are many opportunities to experience culture such as nacho party and takoyaki party that is held occasionally.",3
19143,"If you are looking for a fabulous hotel with amazing and caring staff, please look no further than Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel.  This boutique hotel is stunning, clean, and the Marriott family there is extremely warm and friendly.  They went above and beyond for my husband and me.  Marie Le Roux, Tiago, and Rachida took the time to listen about what we were looking for regarding our experience and followed through with flying colors.  Our room was upgraded, the food was fresh and delicious, and we had a fun and romantic Parisian experience.  I loved this hotel and staff so much that I will be returning this summer.  I recommend very highly, and I have stayed at many hotels around the world.  Best, Jen & Scott Shuster",3

51807,"Laid back in the middle of a busy city, staff were friendly and helpful, friendly place for female travelers, and quaint. Food (though very tasty, simple, and perfect for egg eating vegetarians) is a steep price for what you get, but convenient.  We loved the hotel cat, Jiam, and the open air reception/food area. ",3
49314,"This hotel is really top notch! First the LOCATION is perfect - can easily get almost anywhere with a walk which was great.  in the Gothic quarter stones distance from the cathedral.  Second, the SERVICE was unbelievable - for example, they surprised me with a bottle of champagne and cake for my birthday and i didnt even tell them it was my birthday also at breakfast they gave me a glass of cava, again total surprise.  Third, the ROOM was really nice and clean.  Very spacious.  Fourth, the ROOF DECK had incredible views and awesome comfy vibe for pre-dinner drinks.  Highly recommend this hotel!",3

3584,I have recently returned from a 3-week stay at the Alpina which I thoroughly enjoyed. I stayed for 1 week in a pool villa and another 2 weeks in a pool access room. The villa was luxurious and a real treat if you want to relax away from it all with your own pool (walled off from the rest of the resort) and I would recommend it whole-heartedly. The pool access rooms are also great and really great for the cost.  The breakfast buffet is a must with a great selection and I found it set me up for the day and aside from an afternoon snack kept me going until my evening meal. The staff were all so friendly and really made me feel welcome.  I can honestly say this is one of the best value resorts I've stayed in and is in a great location. Two of tripadvisor's 'Top Ten Beaches in Asia' (Kata Noi and Karon) are within 15-30 minutes walking distance! I'll be back again next year!,3
26725,"Park Avenue is a great place to stay for everyone - from business travellers to entire families. The location is superb, the rooms nice and spacious, the pool wonderful, and the staff top class. It truly is a great place to stay and I will definitely be coming back to Park Avenue.",3

I actually prefer not to be catching the lift as much to Lounge. Carina and Rebecca, 2 excellent staff members. Highly commend. All staff were great tho but those girls stood out. Land Alive bar only ok. We only had a cocktail in there tho, preferred club lounge tbh. Room and spas were lovely once again, and the brekky always a treat. Thankyou. Regards Lorraine",3

51737,just returned frim 4 day break and can recommend the accomodation- Tony on reception provided map and explained in detail where we were and where to go - very helpful- room was clean- shower and bathroom excellent and breakfast plentiful with good choice - orange juice at breakfast was far superior to that given in Italy/Greece/Spain 👌 - ideal location walked everywhere - good food opposite - what more could you want - give it a try - you will not be disappointed !,3
38527,We had 6 of us stay at this gorgeous resort and the staff were amazing. We requested for our rooms to be together and they gave us interconnecting rooms.  Very clean and comfortable  Would absolutely recommend to stay here,3
31809,"The hotel is in the center, clean, colorful rooms, friendly and helpful staff. The owner made sure that we are safe and have good plan to spend in Rome and provided us with transport tips. One of us had to cancel their booking and the Owner was understandable and supportive. They woke up earlier for our breakfast because we had to leave before breakfast time and they gave us more food for our friend who is not staying with us free of charge. The cleaner had to stay after working hours waiting for us to leave. I did not see such kindness and professional. Thank you G and the beautiful team.",3
64378,"Absolutely superb, start to finish - we could not fault a thing.  The location, to begin with, is excellent, just a minute’s walk from Széchenyi István ter, with its bus and tram stops. Adventurous types will find that from here the whole city can be reached very easily using a travel pass on the Budapest Go app. If you are a tourist with more means, the hotel concierge can summon a chauffer-driven Mercedes in minutes - something I *really* recommend for your return to the airport at the end of your trip. The 100E airport bus service is brilliant, but it’s a ten minute walk from the hotel and you don’t always get a seat on the bus, so the €38 car from the hotel can be worth every cent.  On arrival the staff were polite and gave us a very warm welcome and assistance to our room was offered. The room was spacious, with an interior view into a very attractive atrium, and very efficient climate control. There was a huge comfortable bed, sofa, desk, TV, a gorgeous en-suite, a safe, and a bag of everything you need for the hotel spa in the wardrobe. We didn’t use the hotel spa as we were visiting Szechenyi Thermal Bath. Awaiting us in the room was a bottle of wine, chocolates, a personalised letter, and a weather report. The room was cleaned daily and a turn-down service prepared everything, including more chocolates and bottled water, when we returned late in the evening.  Breakfasts in the hotel are particularly good. There is a buffet with a wide variety of continental foods, hot and cold, and a table service for hot drinks and egg dishes. The staff were cheerful and friendly, but not intrusive.  On the whole, this is an extremely well-run hotel. It is always a good sign when you see staff clearly getting on well with each other while working to deliver an excellent service.  We were very well looked after, and will not consider anywhere else next time we are in Budapest.",3
7208,"We stayed at this hotel from dec 28th to Jan 4th.  +   Very good location. Just outside of the metro station. About 20 minutes from the city center. +  Very friendly and helpfull staff +  The neighborhood. Around the hotel you can find everything. From super markets to restaurants ,fast food and bakery. +  Very good breakfast + The room was small but very cute and with big bathroom. +  The price. Very good for Paris and very good for these that offer to you. -  This hotel has 6 floors without elevator. If you are from 3rd floor and up (we was in the 2nd) you have BIG problem. -  The breakfast room was small. Just 4 tables.  - I am not so satisfied from the housekeeper.  -  The WiFi in our room actually does not exist",3

14944,"We stayed in a horizon club room. The staff were professional and always used our names when interacting. The horizon club lounge was nice enough with a good selection of food and drink. Our room was fine.  The hotel itself is beautifully presented, as expected with the Shangri-La chain of hotels. We enjoyed a couple of spa treatments. The massages were good. The gym is clean and well-equipped. The hotel also has a couple of outdoor tennis courts, unfortunately it was quite windy on the day I played but still a nice facility to have.   Food and beverage service was consistently of a high standard. Front desk and concierge were also of a high standard.   We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.",3

59479,"This October, my brothers and I stayed in a triple at the Family Inn Saiko, and it was a fun and memorable experience! We were interested to try a Japanese-style hotel, but were traveling on a bit of a budget. Our stay at this hotel turned out to be the perfect fit - it was very affordable, and we really enjoyed the unique amenities of the hotel. The futons were very comfortable on the tatami floor, and the yukata were a lot of fun to try on. The hotel was also nicely located, about 10-15 minutes' walk from the nearest subway station. The neighboorhood always felt safe to us, even at night. The owner also spoke good English and seemed very personable - he always seemed interested in our travel plans and willing to give us pointers and suggestions. It was nice to know that there was someone we could ask cultural questions if something ever came up.  A couple other points:  + The hotel helped make our trip from the airport really convenient and simple. On their website, they provide a set of dual-language taxi instructions (part of the PDF travel kit) to get from the west entrance of Ikebukuro Station to the hotel. We were simply able to hail a cab in the taxi lane outside, and show the driver the sheet of instructions. The hotel even reimbursed us for the fare, which was very nice. + We had planned a day trip to Kyoto, where we checked out Tuesday morning and checked back in Wednesday night. We were allowed to leave most of our luggage at the hotel while we were away, which made our trip much easier to manage.",3

Only about a 30 min walk to Taipei 101. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The breakfast included in our stay in their Gustoso restaurant was delightful with a wonderful spread of food each morning. ,3
52909,"The hotel room was lovely and nicely presented.  The bed was small, and the room facilities were a little basic....but overall a lovely experience. The staff were great, nice, friendly and helpful.  The car park was small and had to maneuver cars to get in and out, but was private and secure.",3
48082,"First place to think of when visit Phuket! The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. This hotel has the best private beach, a very good place to relax and chill. Great hotel breakfast with variety choices. Highly Recommended for Famliy with kids.",3
58457,"Excellent service, good location, very clean, friendly owners. Apart from accommodation values, we had the best day trip/bycicle tour organized and led by owners and we were not easy - 20 people group. They showed us all Via Appica Antica with its most istoric sites, organized the best Italian lunch in surroundings of the ancient aqueducts. Highly recommended!",3
39701,"It is very clean and good hotel, the location is very good, we can visit minddong night market by walk.距離地鐵站很近，交通便利，早上清潔人員也馬上來打掃，房間有點小，但是很乾淨，有浴缸可以泡澡，很紓解壓力，晚上隔音很好，很安靜，喜歡這樣的環境，這次預定享受早鳥價格還不錯，到高樓可以拍夜景，很漂亮",3
43256,"This is my quarantine hotel and it was really nice! The staff were really polite and professional, I feel safe when I first arrived,. They explained the quarantine policies patiently to me. Michael ,Martin ,Ivan and Ray also all front office staff helped me a lot throughout quarantine. The view was magnificent, it was the sea view that I expected. The meal came on time and sufficient amount of takeaways. Will definitely choose this hotel for quarantine next time !",3

20766,"For those training on the Soi, this place can’t be beat.   Great location, with services and facilities geared for fitness tourists (in room drying racks for those endless hand wraps!).  My room was spacious, if a little dark, with a fridge big enough for all your water bottles. My only complaints - no fan in the sitting room and a vinyl couch. Wifi was solid, good for work during the day and  Netflix at night.   The two pools are excellent - perfect to alternate between as the sun changes.   And the restaurant. Just what you need before/after training. You pay more than elsewhere, but the massive menu is healthy and so, so delicious. I could drink their coconut smoothie all day, everyday.   The staff are incredibly friendly and happy to help.   The only reason I didn’t stay this trip was they were booked out (peak season)... but I’ve been eating there on the regular!  Can’t wait to stay again.  ",3
14445,"Wow!  This old school Hotel in Osaka is simply wonderful.  There are shops of every description, more places to eat that anyone could want, and some truly delightful taverns as well.  My Bride and I wandered down to the Cellar Bar for a night cap last night and found ourselves surrounded in a delightful Old English Club atmosphere featuring a piano bar.  The prices were quite reasonable.  We are planning a wedding here in June so we spent most of yesterday arranging everything from rental Kimonos to western clothing, flowers, meals, invitations, the whole thing in one place. The all day restaurant Remone offers set meals or buffet style meals.  You can purchase breakfast coupons very reasonably,  The in-house bakery is top notch, two florists, and you can even purchase your new Bentley or Rolls Royce in house if you like.  All-in-all this is a wonderful place to stay.  The staff is friendly, it is easy to find english speaking staff, or most any language for that matter.",3
17308,"Clean and new furnished hotel, 15 minute to center by metro, easy access from the airport with bus 100 + metro, fair and fresh breakfast, nice staff, good price, you can buy transport tickets from the lobby",3

45109,"Located in the heart of a vibrant city, this hotel and it's staffs offer truly great experience. The moment I entered into the lobby. I was greeted with warm hospitality by Jatin and his colleagues. The reception staffs expressed genuine passion for ensuring guest satisfaction consistently. ",3
23054,"I have to say after reading the reviews I was apprehensive about going however..... We had a damn good holiday. The staff were fantastic... The animation team were excellent, worked very hard and done their best to ensure you enjoyed your holiday, particularly Pedro who is a lively, lovely kid always happy, smiling and welcoming no matter what the time of day was. They clearly enjoy their job and it shows when they aim to make guests holiday a pleasure. Adel is also all of the above. Lots of activities and entertainment throughout the day and night and beach water sports are really cheap and fantastic value for money. The waterpark is fab. We never experienced rudeness from any member of staff and Feret behind the pool bar was an absolute star, always smiling and pleasant. The ONLY downfall at this hotel was the food mostly catered for the russians, but we didn't starve! The All inclusive drinks were just Ok, not great. I would definitely revisit this hotel. The staff were lovely, well done Pedro, Adel and gang - you lot made our holiday the best!!!",3
18318,"Bar none, this was the best experience we have had in Paris. We used to frequent Paris quite often and enjoyed evenings at the Cercle de l'Union Interalliee. The Maison Astor is within easy walking distance of many of our favorite Vendome places and private clubs.  We have never had better service in a hotel, anywhere. The staff was gracious and incredibly helpful, even making sure we had bottled water for a hot day's walk each day. Breakfast in the morning was something we looked forward to the moment we went to bed at night.  As Hilton Diamond members we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was very spacious and comfortable. The bed and room amenities were stellar and included a personalized greeting for our status.  I can't think of a better place to stay that's within walking distance to so many special places and made our trip to the City of Light so much more special than any of our past visits.",3
41845,"Just got back from 5 nights at Candi Beach Resort and it was amazing. The luxury ocean view suite was spacious and clean with gorgeous views from the balcony complete with comfy daybed and generous jacuzzi. Everything had been thought of including a complementary bottle of bubbles. We were debating between the ocean view villa or the suite but were glad we picked the suite as my partner is terrified of mosquitos and the amazing views of the ocean from the suite due it’s elevation made up for the lack of a private pool, especially as the infinity pool is only a few steps away, and there was always plenty of lounges. Can’t say enough good things about this place, all the staff were so friendly, the food and drinks were reasonably priced for a resort and there were even two cute shops Mendira House and Alam Zempol within 5min walk away if you were feeling adventurous. We had a 2.5hour treatment at the ocean spa which was pure bliss, we were treated like royalty, wish we were back there now. The resort seems to be spread between 2 properties, and is probably recommend asking if you can stay in the main area where the villas are as it’s closer to breakfast/main pool areas. If you’re hesitating about going - don’t and if you’ve made a booking, I’m so jealous of you right now!",3
14450,"Sometimes a good plan really does just come together. On my first visit to Taiwan, I was unsure of the area or the best location for a hotel. I went with the ability to get there, from the airport, using public transportation.  Metro Taipei gave me two options for getting to the Madison Taipei Hotel. I had a full two blocks, to walk, after leaving the MRT station. Then, I turned right. The hotel was a few steps away, with a staff member, at the door, happy to assist me. I entered into a hotel with an amazing boutique feel. The Urban 331 Whiskey bar was just across from the front desk. I quickly checked in and went to my room, before heading down for a cocktail. The hotel offers a choice of pillows and hypoallergenic mite-proof blankets for their guests. They go out of their way to ensure that you’ll get a good nights sleep. After you’re rested and ready to check out the town, the Da’an District of Taipei awaits you. I did the short walk to Da’an Park and was amazed by all the wildlife there. Had I known about this hotel and the surrounding area, I would have booked a much longer stay. It’s definitely on my list for the next time I’m in Taipei.",3

22605,"Just returned from an excellent stay from 30/04/23 to 03/05/23.  On arrival Claudia organised an early check in (10.30am) and was friendly and very efficient.      The room on the 2nd floor was a good size with a comfortable bed, sofa, desk & chair.  The flat screen television had various English channels including BBC1 & BBC2.  The room had complimentary water (replaced daily), tea / coffee maker, fridge, safety deposit box, bathrobes & slippers.  The bathroom was a good size with two sinks & a large walk in shower with complimentary toiletries.  The toilet was separate to the bathroom.  The room had an enclosed balcony (you could open the windows) with a wooden chair & a fantastic view of the IJ river & bridge which connects the mainland.  The room was very quiet & the décor looked modern and new.      Breakfast is served until 10.30am during the week & 11am on the weekend. There was an excellent choice ranging from fruit to cooked breakfast with delicious bread, pastries & cakes.  The hotel also has a bakery which is open until 6pm & a lunch or dinner menu from 12pm onwards.  The food was delicious but prices were on the expensive side.    The hotel has an Indonesian theme, the indoor gardens with tropical plants, palm & banana trees are stunning.  It’s possible to walk through the gardens over wooden bridges & you can also sit in the gardens if you want to relax.  It’s possible to see the top of the gardens from the room corridors, lots of thought has gone into the fantastic design.  Hotel is one of the most environmental friendly hotels in the Netherlands with a solar panel roof & sustainable building materials during construction.    The hotel is located in a quiet location, walk takes approximately 20 minutes to the centre.  If you don’t fancy walking public transport is very frequent.  Bus 43 stops outside the hotel every 15 minutes or you can catch tram 26 if you walk over the bridge.  Thanks to all staff for an excellent stay.  ",3

57700,"I’ve stayed at Wake Up for over five months, and it was the best time of my life! The staff is super friendly and always willing to help you 24/7, kitchen is clean and there is a lot of space to cook, bedrooms are big and clean (housekeeping cleans every day) and there’s a lot of space to chill and meet other travelers. The hostel has a cafe and a bar, both with friendly staff and delicious food and drinks!  Central station is a few minutes walk and from there you can go to all nice places Sydney has to offer. There’s a supermarket 5 minutes from the hostel and various places where you can buy dinner. Wake Up! Sydney has been a second home for me, when I can, I would definitely come back! ❤️",3
8885,"We stayed at La Casa Gran a couple of years ago and had a great time. And when we returned to Barcelona this year we decided to return. I am very glad we did. The place has changed hands and is now run by Anna and Victor who made us so welcome and gave us lots of good advice about places to eat, places to see, transport, beaches, etc, etc. They went out of their way to help us. They have opened up the terrace for breakfast which was a very relaxing way to start the day. And breakfast itself was great with lots to choose from. Particularly liked the bread, with local meats and cheeses, and also homemade carrot cake. Room was very clean and comfortable for myself, my wife and our two kids (16 and 12). We wouldn't hesitate to go back and have already recommended to our friends.",3
20240,"The guys were incredibly helpful, available to answer questions/help out 24/7, explained everything we needed upon arrival. The room was impeccable, beds comfortable, sheets crisp and clean.The bathroom had all toiletries provided and again very clean. Although the B&B is near a main road, the room is very quiet and peaceful. Wifi is very fast. There was a mini fridge in our room which was very convenient for keeping a bit of extra food. Location is fantastic- not right in the centre but 5 minutes to the Vatican and 10 minutes to the centre via bus.There is a nice supermarket just across the road if you need to buy water, fruit, some extra food e.t.c. Fresh coffee/cappuccino is served for breakfast which was very nice. Overall, we had a fantastic 3 days in Rome, thank you to the guys from Heart in Rome!",3
27671,"Pleasant stay Arrived early at 11am from Incheon airport, couldn't check in yet as the hotel was full. This was explained professionally and they stored our bags whilst we went for lunch at Myeongdong Street.   Check in at 3pm ready for us. Made a few requests for room without any problems. As bonvoy Gold member, they recognise your tier and try to accommodate at best, of course understandable as it is all subject to availability. Location was good, near shopping malls Shinsagae and Lotte. Near Myeongdong Street. All walkable.   Stayed 4 nights and was happy to extend another night, paid to upgrade to suite since they were running the Green program. So Total stay of 5 nights. Jane Jang the manager was helpful to sort out the booking for the additional night and transfer timing. So we were able to move rooms to the suite in the morning given their availability and as we had to leave for a day tour, everything was ready for us on time. It was also on the same floor so no hassle at all. Thank you Jane.   They are also quick to respond on the Bonvoy chat for any requests.  I moved to another hotel (Shilla chain) in another district for the later part of my trip and I have to say that my stay at Aloft was  definitely more pleasant. ",3

The staff is excellent and cooperative   Special shout out to Melati from morning shift and Kris from evening shift.  The breakfast is excellent which includes a variety apart from bali cuisine.  Location of hotel is perfect coz it not far from beach and there in pleasant surrounding .  No problem for renting bikes or car coz the hotel can arrange for you at the market price.  Also pool is quit big enough  Speciality is the customer services ,  infrastructure, breakfast, bike and car facilities.",3

Due to COVID, their restaurant wasn’t open which was disappointing but the hotel did provide coffee & continental breakfast box each morning. FYI no fridge or microwave in rooms. Parking garage directly across street, restaurants, coffee all nearby to walk to. Try Cesarios for dinner. Excellent!  I would definitely stay again and highly recommend.",3
53973,"My friends and I had a great stay at the wise owl hostel. Not the first, we booked a private room, it was just what you expected, not too far walking to Shibuya or ikejiri station, staff were friendly and helpful. Would book it again in the future.",3
26884,"They have clean and quiet rooms, friendly and helpful staff, and a relaxing facility.  It is quite pricy, but probably worth it if fits in your budget.  The pool was perfect, the grounds were serene.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance (though Austin's wildlife has become increasingly weird after dark.)",3
58175,"Great and SAFE location for anyone, especially single females.  About an 8 minute (or less) walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The extra security of the locked front door gave peace of mind.  Was very excited to experience the old world charm that the San Remo had to offer and we were not disappointed!  The, ample, shared facilities added to the experience.  We never had to wait to use the restroom or showers and always very clean. The staff was always so very helpful and polite, we took advantage or the complementary coffee & hot chocolate and snacks!  We both thought the ""Quiet hours"" was a nice touch.  If you have several younger children that need assistance with restroom and shower needs, this may not be the spot for you, certainly an option with one or two. You do, however, have to climb a flight of steps to get to the reception and room area, again not a problem for us but may be for some.  We also took advantage of the Fior d'Italia on our first evening, highly recommend it for the food and old world charm!  Overall, I have no negatives from our visit and have already told friends about it and would absolutely visit again.",3
12391,"A very pleasant experience living at Hotel Metropolis.

Desserts very impressive so much variety and I'm a very fussy eater.The hotel grounds were lovely we had a nice balcony overlooking the pool and aqua park gardens and snow capped atlas mountains in the other direction .The staff were very attentive.we didn't join in with the activities but they appeared to be very good always a chat with everyone making them all feel a valued guest.Would most definitely recommend.,3
10706,"The Shelborne does it AGAIN!! My trips to South Beach just keep getting better and better thank you to Shelborne Hotel & the wonderful staff. Armando & Delisa are literally the BEST. Truly make me feel like family and so special from the time I walk in the door. Recently divorced after 20 years, and now a single Mom of 6 children. I had a much-needed girl's trip with 2 friends last year for my birthday and the trip was PERFECT. My friends had never been to Miami and Armando, Delisa & all staff showed us the BEST time. Very very accommodating, very clean, and our room was Amazing. As much as we love the beach, we could not get enough of the pool area..super fun & chill. And the food at the pool is soooo yummy, everything on the menu is great!  Best Girl's trip EVER!! Then this year for my birthday, my 6 children & I stayed at Shelborne for 8 days. The hotel is very kid friendly. We had a beautiful Townhouse room that overlooked the pool. The Townhouse rooms at the Shelborne are incredible. My kids & I LOVED it so much. 2 levels, 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths, a full kitchen, and a very spacious living room area. We stayed 8 days and it felt so much like home we wanted to stay another week! My kids want to come every summer to Shelborne, it's all they talk about!! I came last week by myself for 4 days. This Momma needed a break from home! Of course, my time went by way too quickly, but it was once again PERFECT. My room was beautiful!! So comfortable & relaxing. The views were breathtaking. The bed was so comfortable, bathroom was fabulous! The hotel is very modern & classic South Beach style, and super clean. Again, ALL staff is so nice, kind and catering. I would not want to stay anywhere else while visiting South Beach. Thank you to All staff and especially Armando (manager) and Delisa (front desk) for ALWAYS showing your girl an unforgettable, beautiful time and making me feel so special. I am forever grateful to have these amazing memories... 100% VIP treatment!!!",3
24969,"Great place & what a super service given by staff, specially Harun. Really looked after us through out our stay. Welcome drinks, romantic bed layout & strawberry’s with chocolate was icing on the cake. Every day restaurants booking & tours done by Harun was great too. Will come back.",3

Moreover, other staffs all are nice and friendly to help. Wonderful stays and sure will choose this service apartment again.",3
28963,"I will truly never be able to say enough amazing things about the service we received for my wedding 3/19/22 at the W Chicago City Center!! From our first tour they clearly were the best option and showed the best service- Our tour was so much better than everywhere else that I was nervous it could just be a show that one time, but the W continued to go beyond my expectations throughout. The price point was great for what we wanted and they were so flexible. When we had last minute COVID drop outs, they came up with the idea to send those plates upstairs to our babysitters which was so sweet (made us look quite thoughtful but was actually their idea!!) I also felt I could be really transparent about money and where we wanted to spend/save which I think is really important for planning such a big and expensive day like this.  Jill Natale is an example of incredible customer service!! She kept me calm through the whole process and made so many things we asked for happen- anything we asked for she immediately tried to make happen for us. I don’t think I ever heard a no from her. She wanted the day to look like our vision and we got that and more. Her vendor suggestions were great and aligned with the price/quality we were looking for. To be honest I don’t think I even needed an outside wedding planner because Jill was so great. Close to the wedding I would just defer family members to Jill, which I don’t even think was actually her responsibility, and she would help with their reservations and other requests and they would always end up texting me telling me how amazing jill is !! My whole family literally just kept going on about how great Jill is. I currently a physician in training so it was very hard for me to balance planning, and Jill made the planning process seamless for me even with how busy I was!! I don’t think I ever had to follow up on a thing, she was always on top of everything.  Fatima at the front desk was always willing to help with anything I needed even when I didn’t ask!! I was trying to do something last minute the morning of the wedding and without even asking her, she handled it for me. Our families loved Fatima and wanted us to make sure we shouted her out for how great she treated everyone. She seemed to know not only me and zack but so many names of our friends and family which was so nice!  Juan at the restaurant/ room service kept everyone smiling and happy! Everyone remembered him and would mention him to me because he made all of our meals so nice and brought such joy to every setting. It was so fun to come down and eat with different members of my family and have him serving us, we all loved him!  The night of the wedding and morning after the wedding there we had help from another member of the team (I am soo sorry I forget her name- I don’t think I met her until the after party so I was all over the place by then- she had longer dark hair)!! She was also great and kept everything organized and smooth so I didn’t have to worry about it. If we had any questions she sorted it out right away and helped us end the wedding night on a great note.  Israel was the first point of contact at the door and provided a great first impression. Reynaldo was also wonderful! Everyone just kept commenting how overall everyone at the W was so great to them (not just the bride and groom which is so nice to know how well our guests were treated). My family all commented that the doorman were great all weekend.  The FOOD was incredible and everyone also raved about that- from the restaurant to room service to our entrees.   The hotel overall is so beautiful. I can not wait to see the pictures from getting ready in the EWOW suite. There was so much room and it was such a great background for photos the morning of. I loved our cocktail area in the plateau. One of the reasons I picked this hotel was because it still had these beautiful accents of chicago history being an old hotel, but the ballroom and hotel rooms were sleek and modern- it was hard to find that combo in chicago. I am kind of picky and i honestly never thought that the ballroom would end up looking like the idea I had in my head, but it was truly even better and walking into the ballroom for the first time is one of the best memories I have from the wedding. I still can’t believe how incredible it looked.  Overall besides the beauty, price and location, I mostly picked W city center because of the great service and I finished up the weekend the most happy with how wonderful the service was. It truly made the weekend. I was a very nervous bride and it was great to be surrounded by support and people who wanted me to be happy! There were two small instances of things that we weren’t thrilled with (one before the wedding and one after the wedding, nothing the day of), and they immediately adjusted both of them for us and were willing to work with us with those two things - they weren’t major problems but of course things wil come up that we will question and it was really lovely that instead of just telling us that’s how things were, they looked into it and ended up adjusting things for us very quickly. Even through they weren’t big issues, things will come up and so I think it’s a really positive thing that when something did come up they handled it so well and in such a way that was not stressful for us.   Especially in the time of COVID, you never would have known the likely chaos going on behind the scenes amongst the service industry- it was fantastic. When we toured venues everyone seemed to be a little shaky after COVID and short staffed. I am sure these issues were everywhere, but the W seemed organized and on top of everything. Other places seemed to be explaining why service was different than pre-pandemic, but at the W things seemed to somehow be running perfectly.   My whole family also knows all of the names of everyone because they also provided such great assistance to them. It was so important for me to share the city I love with the people I love and the W staff was a huge part of giving everyone a great chicago experience. Everyone keeps talking about how amazing the service at the hotel was- it really put the final touch on a perfect weekend for us. Sorry this is so long but like I said, I will never be able to say enough good things and could keep going…!!!  Thank you so much for a perfect wedding weekend!!",3
40651,"A typical friendly and tailor made welcoming, with a touch of craziness as it was New Year’s Day. Club Med remains a wonderful place for kids and family. The Guilin resort is filled of sculptures that make it unique. One little thing that could have been improved was the food: it was very good, but I have seen even better in other Club Meds.",3
20716,What a quaint urban hotel!!  Perfectly placed for getting round Singapore and a fabulous little roof top pool.    The rooms as the hotel are kept immaculate.  The bar has some great happy hour deals..... that last 7 hours 😁😁 and they play some great background music you can sit with a drink watching the world go by.    Last but not least the staff are amazing they cant do enough for you.  Always o  hand to help and advise you on places to go etc.    Finally I'm not a breakfast person but I really did enjoy their set breakfast just enough to eat with juice water and coffee readily available   Would definitely recommend and stop here again   ,3

1166,"We came for a 1 night stay with my friends in a very low season, the hotel was almost empty.  I asked them in advance if they offer vegan options for breakfast and they were taking special care of it adding extra options to their regular offer. The room was clean, beds are comfy, the shower is super spacious and the terrace on the roof is a great spot for evening wine or morning coffee Highly recommended",3

18168,"I only stayed here for one night because I spent two nights at Fira at a more expensive villa but this suite is far more superior! Firstly, it was away from the crowds at Oia. Sure you have to walk quite a bit from the main road to your suite but it's no big deal because once you are in your suite, you'll know it's worth it. The room and bathroom is so big for two, so was the balcony. The view was amazing and it was so quiet and so peaceful. I felt really relaxed and wanted to just chill at our balcony. Moreover the staff were extremely helpful. We had a car and they met me at the main road to get our luggage for check in and accompanied me to the parking lot to make sure we don't get lost. I told them we had a very early flight the next day and would miss breakfast, when we came home from dinner that night we found ready pack breakfast and drinks for us to-go, and a bottle of champagne for the night. It's all in the small details ya'll! Top notch service and I will recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in Oia! Thank you!",3

24952,My experience in Istanbul was an exceptional one because of this hotel. I arrived at 1 pm with no booking and they accommodated me on the same day. Later on I needed to add an extra day and they extended my stay right away. They made me feel very welcomed and they were always there to respond to my questions and requests. This will be my go to hotel whenever I visit Istanbul. All the staff are happy to work here. The buffet breakfast was amazing too. I would highly recommend it. Thank you for your generosity :),3

The breakfasts served are very well balanced with loads of variety ... to different type breads and fruits.  I love the honey in beehive-bee (::)) display.  The location is also great, walking distance to the best tourist sports and best neigbourhood of Athens.  A great place to have a nice walk around, day and night, safely.   Only, they got to have more/better parasols.",3

The view from the rooftop lounge area was our favorite. Great proximity to the bridge, harbour and opera house.",3
45466,We have stayed here on our birthday trip to Japan. The Ritz Carlton Osaka is situated on a prime location. Room was very nice and we booked for the corner suite. The check in& out process was smooth and efficient though it could be a bit of a wait on check in. Staffs were very nice and helpful. Their breakfast was simple amazing. We will definitely stay here again if we revisit to Osaka.,3
22881,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights from 14th-18th April. The staff were very pleasant, kind and helpful. Room was spotless, and fresh towels and amenities every day. Had a problem with sink plug, but it was fixed very promptly. We needed a kettle and were provided one, with 10 euro deposit, which was returned once we returned the kettle. Staff printed some document we needed, free of charge. Breakfast was excellent. Bacon, scrambled and boiled eggs. Rolls and bread, danish pastries, pancakes, and all kinds of tarts and cakes. Also cereal, youghurts, fresh fruit, fruit cocktail and prunes. Lots of cold drinks and tea and coffee. Staff couldn't do enough for us. The area was quite far from centre of Rome, but the train station was 5 minutes walk. Took 20 minutes to Termina. We usually used the bus/metro combination though. This took about an hour. Bus stop was a minute from the hotel. We used the combined bus/metro/tram ticket which cost 12.50 euro for 48 hours. ",3
24663,Room were amazingly clean and had everything  The location is central to everything and close to the attractions  The morning walking tour was very informative and Amazing cino made everything fun and friendly and answered everything I asked,3

41083,"We stay during Carnival and booked this to be walking distance to the parade. Highly recommend as the entrances are a short distance, the sea view is breathtaking and the view of the parade from atop is a bonus.  As Ambassador, we got upgraded to a Sea View Jr Suite. It was comfortable and it had a wonderful terrace to relax.  Breakfast had a view of the sea. The food was splendid. And the croissants were flakey just like the way they should be. By the way, my wife is gluten intolerant. We learned that French wheat and European wheat in general is much different than US wheat. She was able to eat croissants and wheat products while in Europe without a problem - your milage may vary. Google it.  Carnival in Nice needs to be on everyone's bucket list. And Le' Meridien is the perfect location to enjoy such a wonderful event. We attended the Carnival parade three out of the five days we were there.",3
3984,"Pleasant and comfortable hotel in ideal location. Room was quiet with comfortable bed and good shower and plenty of plug points for device charging (you would need a charger though as no USB sockets I could see). Comfortable bar and restaurant area downstairs. Please note that the rooftop facilities have seasonal opening so check on opening if essential for you. The terrace was still accessible though for the compulsory Acropolis shot, even in early spring.",3

The staff were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for us, and they ensured we had everything we needed, including a hearty breakfast every morning! The quality of service and food was impeccable. The rooms, bar and restaurant were super clean and comfortable and lovely stylish design. Overall it’s hard to beat in London!",3
1964,"I like this hotel as it is really close to Shinsaibashi. Although the room is really small, we can't walk when we open two luggage, haha.. I will try bigger room next time. On the other hand, they provide free drinks from 2-11pm in the lobby. When we back from a cold street, we can have a great hot tea and coffee, that is really amazing.  Staff are helpful but the connection of Wifi is very poor.",3
1946,"Modern hotel with great amenities, well located close to major covered shopping area. Room came with Japanese breakfast Buffet, also unlimited Tea, Coffee and soft drinks. Beds were comfortable staff were helpful and spoke some English. Hotel had very good laundry, Would recommend this hotel to singles and family's .",3
62891,"My first time in Budapest and the experience was wonderful, a mix of old and new. Budapest is extraordinary and crackles with energy ..The Corinthian Hotel is beautiful and well worth a visit, the staff are warm friendly, always at hand and unobtrusive.  The Spa Centre is well worth a visit, if you want to be calmed, soothed and relaxed then make a point of going. A big thank you to reception staff, Szandra and Csilla, who made the experience seemless and memorable. I shall certainly be back ...Oh did I mention the ensemble Hungarian band that plays of an evening gaurenteeing a smile to go with drinks! I'm back in January and can't wait. Paul",3
64888,"This is one of the most interesting places you can sleep at while in Tokyo. There are, of course, older, more fascinating capsule hotels there, but First Cabin is newly-open and it offers top notch facilities, excellent service, comfort and everything at the best price.   Be advised, however, that if you are travelling as a couple you will have to sleep in different cabins, as cabin hotels usually have separate floors for women and men :) The place is very safe and clean.   Choose First Cabin Tsukiji if you wish to visit the Tsukiji fish market and especially the tuna auction (at 4 a.m.) - it's located in the close vicinity of the market and they can help with instructions on how to attend the auction and how to reach the market in 5 minutes walking.",3

45320,"My experience at The Yard was great. The owner named Som is super kind and very accommodating. The first two nights I stayed in the private room which was a real delight. The beds are the must comfortable beds I have found within my time here backpacking around Bangkok. I then spend another two nights in a shared room. The mattresses were the same for both rooms! I don't normally write reviews but I just had to with this place. The beds are excellent, the AC is excellent, the staff is excellent, they have laundry available, a bar available, a kitchen to use, they even have bikes you can borrow for free to get around town, but the real kicker is they have a tv with netflix and a PS4 with some fun games. After being on the road for so long it was an odd and wonderful feeling to be able to lay down on a couch with a beer and play some videogames. The whole experience has been a complete blast and very relaxing. A real 10/10 for comfort, fun, and relaxation. Come join the family at The Yard!",3
42733,"Nice hotel, very friendly stuff  good food. A massive improvement potential though: - A little more organisation and plan would help, all rmployees are running like headless chicken all the time whereas they really should not if things were just a tiny bit organized - Upon check in, you get handed a banch of cards and off you go. We had to figure out everything ourselves, where breakfast is, where the lift is, ..... - check in lasts forever and two days, if they would prepare everthing before hand, it would just be the formalities and would save everyone time",3
25646,"We needed a hotel near the medical center where I was to see a Neurologist, and this was just a short distance.

17387,The hotel is in an ideal location for the trams that take you around Prague and a short walk to  the river.

Quiet location - Rooms are fresh and clean with large beds and good pillows.  TV's and internet all work well which is good when travelling for business.  Love the fact that I can connect to Netflix.  Bath has a shower over the top which is sometimes hard to get out - no real shower facility for people of elderly age or bad knees.

You don't even need to leave the premises at all, they got you covered with everything. Even included a mini club (childcare or a camp) for the kids to  attend few hours a day to socialize and learn new things while you relax they get entertained. My boys loved being there with very friendly personnel each & every day. As a family we enjoyed the shows every night they had different groups performing at the theater. Through out the hotel, personnel were extremely professional and helpful. Always there when you needed them.We also loved their food a lot, everyday they had a wide variety of food with different themes.  Definitely looking forward to coming back to this hotel!",3

The Russell is in a great location to get around the city or out to the country side with either the trains, ferries and buses and soon to be the trams or book yourself a tour.

41686,"We had a wonderful time at Blue Dolphins’ ! We stayed in a two bedroom- suite with private balcony and a breathtaking view of the Caldera. Rooms were spacious, very clean, nicely furnished with all amenities included. A delicious  healthy homemade breakfast was served on our terrace. Staff was very kind and friendly, and followed all COVID-19 safety precautions. They were willing to fulfil all our requests and always ready to provide tips about things to do and restaurants. Location could not be any better! The only bad thing is that we had to come back home but we’ll visit again!  We highly recommend it!!!",3
11177,"We loved this place. IT was perfect. We had a quiet night in a nice room, in a very cool house style hostel. The staff was very helpful and smiled a lot. Make sure to look out for the scams when you get outside! Ask the front desk about these when you get there!",3
57651,"Wake up Sydney is a fantastic and helpful hostel that caters for most needs. There is an abundance of helpful information on the best sights to see in Sydney as well as the best ways to visit them. The room was small but comfortable for the price we paid. The kitchen area was busy however we didn’t  have to wait long to cook. The atmosphere was friendly and there was plenty of opportunity to meet people and make friends including at the bar below the hostel and guided beach walks organised by the friendly staff. With the Hostel being so close to the station it meant, travel to and from the airport was easy and the walk to the opera house takes around 45 minutes and allows you to see the Sydney CBD.",3
42104,"An amazing 2 nights stay with superb ocean view of the whole Macau and fantastic service of St Regis. We booked the Ocean View room and got upgraded to a suite.  Really impressed by the 180 degree stunning view with the whole Macau lying  across the river and in front of the ocean.  The architectural design is spectacular. Furniture and amenities are all top-rated.   So surprised of the caring customer service of St Regis that they noted my recent stay at St Regis Shenzhen in May (another impressive stay). Thank you so much to Miss Tatiana Markushina, the Guest Recognition Manager of St Regis Shenzhen who has reminded the Zhuhai team arranging the best service for us. We were warmly greeted by the Miss Amanda Liao, the chief butler who led us to the suite. Also, Miss Jodie Yuan, the smart and friendly front desk leader. The food and service quality at LaBrezza are great. Don’t miss the spa too.  What a good place for weekend trip! You don’t need to go anywhere but enjoy the room and service.",3

If we return to Rome we will certainly return home Martini",3

22051,"We were in Paris for 4 days and after staying near the Eiffel tower, we planned to stay for 2 days at La Manufacture. This is a very heritage-looking hotel right next to Place d'Italie. The location is perfect with buses and metro just 1 min away. The staff of the hotel was really nice and helpful. The rooms are very good, slightly smaller but good. We were offered an upgrade but we have to let go of the balcony. We did not take it but it was really nice of the hotel to offer.   Overall, totally recommended !!",3
1356,"This is the second time we stayed in this hotel when we are traveling to Korea.  The hotel was very easy to access, we took the subway to Euljiro 4-ga(exit10), and take a small walk to the hotel for 5-10 minutes. This hotel located between these tourist areas, like Myeongdong and Namdaemun. If you are going to these areas, you could be considered the shuttle bus service by the hotel.  The reception serves 24 hours, the staff was friendly and helpful. And they could help us to keep our luggage, if you went there too early to check-in, just like me. The room was great, clean, comfortable, and really big. The room service will keep everything in your room clean and maintained every day. Space was totally enough to put 2 opened 28” luggage. The bathroom was good too, I love the shower and the bathtub. Water provided each day, also you may refill with the water dispenser machine outside the room and near the lift. There was an ice maker too. They will turn on the heater at night which is cold weather outside, it might quite hot in the middle of the night. I suggest that you may turn on the window for a little bit to balance the room temperature.",3

16779,"Hotel was convenient to reach by public transport. Airport bus stops outside, so does the train but walk underground to/from the train is long. Loved being on the 4th floor close to the pool and lifts. To roll out of bed in the morning and go for a swim before breakfast couldn’t have been easier. Long pool 20 m? With lots of day light streaming in and charmingly lit in the evening for a relaxing swim. Open 6 am until late. Mostly quiet at the pool over the weekend. Also gym facilities next to the pool . Running machine, cross trainer and some weights etc.  Did not eat breakfast at the hotel.  In the basement of the building there are cafes selling excellent coffee. Fabulous supermarket with stunning fresh food for sale. Our room  was a bit small with twin beds.( requested)  One of our party  had a lovely bright large double room.  Street noise did not disturb us, AC worked well. None of the sights are on the doorstep but public transport it fast, frequent, inexpensive and easy to use. Interesting choice of places to eat around the hotel with : modern, traditional,  market , food available. Hotel gave  a good recommendation of traditional food  restaurant which was tasty, varied and Korean. We were grateful for the direction otherwise would have been tricky,  most people speak  only Korean .... surprise surprise!!!!! People are helpful and really want visitors to enjoy their stay.  ",3

A short walk from the main station and the metro. It is a 25 minute walk to the Duomo. There are coffee shops and restaurants in the area. We ate at L'Antro Della Sibilla, again a return visit. It was excellent. The hotel room and bathroom were both spotlessly clean. Comfortable bed. There is a safe and a fridge with complementary soft drinks in the room. Very good buffet breakfast.

3981,"After searching for a ""home base"" while in Athens I discovered The Herodion for our group of 8 and we were all so thrilled that I did.  From the moment we arrived to the minute they left it was an amazing experience.  The facility itself is well maintained, in a very accessible spot for visiting the cities many historic sites (the Acropolis is right over your shoulder) and just a couple of blocks from a Metro station.   The staff was so great to work with.  Check-in was very efficient. They answered questions and made stellar recommendations throughout our stay.  They assisted us with booking some sight seeing expeditions and when the bus bringing us back one night was not a good experience the hotel staff took it personally when we shared our concern.  The desk staff kept apologizing to us (it was not their fault), but within 8 hours we had a note from the tour company (also apologizing as it was the first time they had used this bus company because their usual partner was booked out) and sent us a small refund.  The lobby bar/restaurant was fantastic and again, the staff was so friendly and helpful.  The daily American breakfast buffet was so good and easy to use.  I hate to brag anymore because if everyone discovers this gem in Athens it will be harder to get a room the next time we go.  Note - we were there right before ""season"" kicks into high gear.  If you want to avoid the larger crowds of summer, as well as the heat and humidity, I highly recommend going in late March/early April.",3

14582,"We stayed at this hotel in 2016 just after it first opened.  The location is ideal... convenient to the historic center and steps from the Metro.  I'm not sure how the Room Mate Giulia team does it, but the hotel looked even better on this visit than what we remembered when it was new.  It is a beautifully maintained and managed property with a highly engaged team that we felt was focused on helping us get the most out of our stay in Milan.",3
54983,"Very nice hotel with a very convenient location.  We could walk to the Acropolis and other major sites.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.   We had a room that was supposed to have a  garden view, but that area is currently under construction.  The hotel made an accommodation but note if you have a similar room, there is some construction noise from around 8 to 3.   Good breakfast included in the rooftop restaurant, which features great views of the city.",3

Beatriz and her partners were all very helpful and knowledgeable and readily available to assist. Beatriz runs a very tidy ship and it smells it too. I was in the small room with the en-suite bathroom which was perfect for me & very comfortable, the bathroom was nice, modern and big. My room was located in the entrance of the breakfast area but noise was never a problem for me. The breakfast had enough of a variety.  My parents stayed in a bigger room which was also very nice. By the way, there is an elevator, which is very helpful for people with big luggage, like my parents. And for those who travel light, like me, just walk up one flight of stairs.",3
8804,"Our second stay here and looking forward to coming back.  Great service, the most sensational spa and great restaurant choices.  Our 7 year old daughter loves the kids club also which allowed us to enjoy massages and facials in the spa.  The adults only pool is also a nice touch that is attached to the spa.   Many resort spas have people just going through the motions, this place has real professionals.  Great options at great value. Everywhere you go in this resort the staff are super helpful and cannot do enough for you.  It is nice to see the variety of restaurants is so vast from simple snacks and takeaway to fine dining options. We look forward to returning again next year",3

Its 24-hour check-in made coming and going a breeze, and the multilingual staff were all friendly and helpful.

These perks included complimentary coffee and tea downstairs, a communal refrigerator and microwave, and a television and blowdryer in the room itself. WiFi was also free, as was one bottle of mineral water per night. Rooms were exceptionally clean and well-maintained, and windows offered pleasant street views. I usually stay with friends when I am in Paris, but if I am ever unable to, I would stay here again with nary a second thought.

The staff were impeccable and so friendly, the meals amazing from their own organic garden, the coconut ice cream a definite highlight.  Lovely rooms and facilities including a pool, plunge pool, meditation room and yoga space and on site spa.  A definite must is a local village tour with the village cooking class, such an amazing experience!  The Alam Sari is very central to all the places you'd like to explore in Bali and very close to the hustle and excitement that is Ubud!  The staff here could not do enough to ensure our stay was all that we wanted. I highly recommend the Alam Sari!",3

The only surprise was not finding an English station such as CNN on TV. ",3

61765,"We've passed through Milan en route to Como but never stayed in the city itself. Of course La Scala was spectacular as was the Duomo, but it was the Principe that made us decide to return in 2020. This hotel --set in its own little paradise-- was breathtaking. It is maintained to the highest standard, no tired furniture or paint, simply palatial throughout. In 50+ years of Italian travels never have we come across a breakfast buffet with such high quality and extensive options, and this is indicative of the service, the housekeeping and the beauty of the place. The concierge staff, which is where I take the pulse of a hotel, is top drawer, especially Mr. Conte who patiently answered many queries. Our long time favorite hotel, period, is the Meurice in Paris and this sister property is more like a 5 star Paris hotel than other that I have experienced in Italy. The Principe is reason enough to visit Milan.",3
28449,Mong is the best server at the cafe and beach club . He literally made us delighted .  Much love 💕 to such people . Keep up the good work and do pass on the appriciation to such employees in cash or kind . Thanks mong . We love you and your efforts . ,3
22366,I overall enjoyed the stay at this hotel. It was a bit deceiving at first because of construction but it’s a nice surprise inside. I must give a shout out to Samantha and the staff during breakfast time. Samantha made the best Americano coffee and was extremely attentive. The whole restaurant breakfast staff gets a 10 rating. Thank you for making our stay enjoyable.,3

60853,Loved it!  Thanks! Good location-great staff.  Enjoyed the quaintness of the decor.  All around excellent visit.  Really enjoyed neighborhood surrounding the hotel.  Used courtyard every day.  Was at first dismayed at size of room but the hotel was wonderful.,3
14531,We were here for 4 nights. It is our first visit to Taiwan and the front desk was very helpful in guiding us visit places. Good room service. At the restaurant they were really nice to make vegetarian food for us.,3
29202,Good Service and Friendly Staff Aye Moe and Swe took care of the cleaning our rooms and did a fantastic job. Amenities were up to standard and the staff are very attentive to our needs. Recommend coming here.,3
28255,"Ibis Styles is more than the elegant decor and ambience. It compliments the well deserved staycation that is needed. The staff are very friendly and ready to assist from the security to the restaurant. Their food is well prepared and leaves your palette dying for more.  Definitely a second home that’s strategically located near amazing malls, other restaurants and 10 mins away from CBD.  ",3
27833,Stayed 6 nights at Hitel Niwa Tokyo. 5 mins walk from suidobashi railway station so nice n quiet. Comfortable beds & nice western style showers/ bathrooms with good shower pressure. Helpful staff would defnitely stay again.,3
29461,"I stayed in a 4-bed dorm for 4 nights Pros: The hostel personnel were nice and helpful.  *The dorm was super clean ( they cleaned it every day after 12.00). The bed was super comfortable, I just wish the top beds had curtains and that we could open our windows during the night. *Nice kitchen and lounge. No problem getting in and out of the hostel or dorm. *The walking tour with Alberto was great.  *The pub crawl was more of a dancing bar crawl, but it ends at a great nightclub. If you decide to do it, go on a Saturday. Cons:  *the shower curtain is too close to the wall, need to be further away from the shower wall. * it gets stuffy in the rooms at night, and with the aircon blasting, it's very easy to catch a cold",3
23702,Great hotel from which to visit Paris. Very centrally located. Nice breakfast served in the room. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The only thing I would recommend is an eye patch as the outside lights shine through the curtains ,3
14234,"Best location you can get in Osaka, 4 minutes walk from the subway and right in the middle of the shinsaibashi main streets.  Plenty of restaurants and shops just outside the hotel.  The staff is great, very helpful and friendly, they know perfect English and they even have an Australian lady at the front desk speaking fluent English.  The rooms are very clean and the showers are massive!  Highly recommended!",3
45099,From the moment I entered into the establishment I was greeted with genuine smile and warmth. I came here with my kids for an golf tournament during my stay the staffs took good care of me and my family. They went above and beyond to ensure my family's comfort and satisfaction. Everyday without missing a single day Jatin and Vishal ensured my kids breakfasts were ready at 5Am in the lobby so that I can leave on time. Thank you so much guys. We will definitely miss you guys.,3

16712,I was here for almost a week. The swimming pools are so delightful! I stayed in a Deluxe room with a king bad on the Executive floor. The room is very clean and well maintained. The toilet seat lifted up when you opened the toilet room door. It’s dead quiet! I would like to mention the Club Lounge manager Ms Rox，Many thanks for her very kind hospitality. She introduced us hotel’s facilities and cared about us all the time with a charming smile. Really enjoyed the room and surely will come back! It’s just an awesome place to charge your batteries.,3
31653,"Ms. Tabby and the breakfast morning crew are such amazing good hearted people, me, my wife and son was eating breakfast yesterday morning (4/22) and I accidentally left my book bag downstairs with all my passports, money, and essentials. Once I realized few hours later I ran downstairs and didn’t find it our table where we ate, I went to the front desk and there my bag was with Ms. Tabby, I looked through it and everything was there, I thanked her up and down and I still don’t think it was, so here I am doing it again, thank you La Quinta morning crew for you amazing trustworthy hospitality, it really humbled me to know that there is still great human beings in the world! . . .   Btw there was no cameras near the area the bag could have easily been taken so I guess Austin residents in general are great people   Annnddd the rooms and hotel are clean, breakfast was greatly, great hotel in the area !!",3
15922,Great location for sight seeing or shopping.  One block from Union Square. Do the Hop on Hop off bus located at Union Square. Buy the two day pass if you want to go to museums or botanical gardens. There are great restaurants within one block of the hotel.  The hotel restaurant has wonderful food and jazz every night. The staff is friendly and provided great service at every level.  Will stay again!,3
31358,"This resort is truly worth every cent! From the dining to the water sports to the beach, late night parties (every day!) and the service, it’s just world class. Nothing like it!! Shout out to Daria for making the archery range super fun!",3

43777,"Very good location, situated within easy reach of Tram stop and Metro. The Duomo square and Cathedral is about a 10min walk away. Rooms are spacious, well decorated and have all facilities for tea and coffee. Modern bathroom with walk-in shower. Hotel staff are quite friendly. Rooms were always regularly cleaned well. The bar area was ok, however on occasion it was difficult to find any bar staff to order drinks. Although when we found ""Fabio"" who we assume was a Bar and/or Front office manager, everything got better. He interacted with us and chatted, and had a friendly and fun personality. Breakfasts were good, although we did find ourselves waiting for a while for the scrambled eggs to be replenished! Overall it was a pleasant experience and probably earns a 4 star rating.",3
45675,"We visited this hotel with another couple, we had a great welcome staff were so helpful. Rooms were comfy and clean. Breakfast was great and it is in an ideal location. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again if we ever go to Rome. 👍👍👍👍👍",3
67178,"Had a really memorable .The Front desk staff, house keeping staff and the restaurant staff all were  very helpful, courteous and hospitable . The only thing missing was he complimentary laundry. As my son has come for a tournament so that was really required.",3
8464,"The hotel is five minutes away from the metro station and there are many interesting restaurants nearby. The staff was very helpful and the room was clean and big enough. We were able to leave our suitcases behind while we went to Kyoto which was very helpful.   If arriving to Tokyo through Narita, you can take the Narita Express and then a taxi from Tokyo station (about $25).",3
61770,"Walking into this hotel is like walking back in time when people took pride in their work. This Gem of a hotel was such a delight to stay in. The moment you walk through the doors you are struck by the beauty of the place. The Service can not be matched. The Rooms are elegant , yet you feel the comforts of home at the same time. Room Service was Perfection. I can’t remember when I had breakfast sent to my room and everything was cooked perfectly and still hot when it arrived. With everything I have said I still haven’t told you about the best part of this hotel. It’s the Restaurant Acanto. Right in the lobby of this beautiful hotel is one of the best restaurants in all of Italy. We just spent 8 days traveling throughout this country and not one meal rivaled our lunch. I will be dreaming about the Spaghetti Cacio E Pepe. My Arugala salad was delicate and so flavorful. The dessert was delicious. Throughout the meal the chef sent out treats for us to sample. They were indescribably delicious. If I were a Restaurant Critic I would give Acanto Three Michelin Stars! Next time you are in Milano this is the place to stay! ",3
25926,The resort was excellent and I would stay again. The guest service was very helpful and had great customer service. The rooms of the resort was magnificent the pillows were soft and the bed also were soft. ,3
39629,"The Hilton Milan staff were exceptional during this stay. Always friendly, helpful and patient, which isn't always easy when dealing with a large group. the food laid on for us throughout this event was restaurant-style and we were all impressed. The proximity to the station is very handy and the little side streets around the hotel offer a plethora of authentic little restaurants.",3
31158,"Great location,  just steps away from the Vatican, the hotel itself has got a pretty good restaurant, rooms also quite all right.  Breakfast was not that special, but decent and worth to take as a start of the day.  Go for their steaks, but not their burgers, gym was nothing spectacular, but it was just fine.",3
19663,"I would rate this hotel more than five stars. I read about Hotel Reverie on Trip Advisor,. Had such incredible reviews, and I have to say they are all true. Hotel Reverie is not like any hotel.  This hotel is more like coming home to visit .  We got picked up from the airport, and so warmly welcomed by George. We were given home made Chocolate almonds and home made liqueur, by Vana, and then we were seated at the table and told all about Santorini and where to go, where to eat,  things to do……we felt sooooooo welcomed!   Our room , number four was so perfect. It had EVERYTHING! Toiletries, water, information booklets on the hotel etc.we loved our room., little kitchenette, with everything you need.everything so clean. Great hair dryer! Shower! Yummy brekkies and delicious coffee!  It’s central, and has everything you want, and nothing is too big or small to ask.  Nikolina and her parents and staff made us feel so  at home , We could not have imagined staying anywhere else.  We loved the rooftop seating area, every night…sitting up there, watching the sun go down, with some vino, and met some lovely new friends.   We were there for five nights, had all sorts of weather and loved  every minute!  Nikolina and her family run a hotel from love.  You can feel it. Which is so unique these days.  This is their home, that they love and want you to love it and appreciate it as much as they  do….and we certainly have come away with the same love.  We will definitely come back again!  Can not recommend this place highly enough.  Xoxoox",3
45816,"We had a beautiful stay here in Villa Vino Santo , everything was perfect ! It’s a short walk in to Oia and Finikia which we loved , Yota was an amazing host and she helped us have the most fantastic stay !! We miss you Yota !! Sue & Duncan 😊",3
4455,"Beautiful hotel & very accommodating! The resort was awesome! Very safe & clean.    We stopped here for 4 nights. The place is huge.the staff are fantastic and will always say hello which I think is more credit to the local people and there way of life. Especially that supervisor who named Sean, he was really helpful!  We didn’t have the dining option so ate where and when and to be fair for a family of 4 it was ok.  I highly recommended this hotel for vocation!",3
15183,"We had a wonderful stay at Phuket Marriott Merlin Beach. The staff were very friendly and our toddler thoroughly enjoyed the Kids club, which needs a special mention for the meticulously planned activities - so many that we enjoyed - a butterfly tour, cupcake decoration, Thai dessert making and best of all, the foam party in the pool. The club also had a wide range of toys to keep kids of all ages occupied. The beach is small but private and we were lucky to experience calm waters that allowed for swims on all the days that we were there. Unfortunately the high tides would bring in a lot of trash to the shore, but again a shout out to the staff who would regularly pick out the trash to keep the beach clean. Last but not least, a shout out to the staff at DOCG - James, Nok, Tee and Aey - for a very warm service that ended with complimentary desserts on our last night!",3
63993,"Lombadry is a very good Option to stay in Midtown, very close to good stores, and easy to walk around.The room is very spacious and nicely decor, with minibar, and microwave so is more like a suite tahn a room,",3
50244,"I was a bit reluctant as I was told that this area is too crowded and previously reviews made me think twice and I made the mistake of booking one night at Febris. That was a highly overrated hotel with a big price tag. we left the next day and checked in to the terrace at Kuta. Wow, it couldn't be any better. Everything was at the doorstep, beach, shopping spas, nightlife restaurants. Found the best spa in Bali only at 5 minutes to the terrace at Kuta. rooms are clean. Standard is a bit small with glass doors of the bathroom. But the premier rooms are spacious. They have all the basic amenities. The receptionist and staff are friendly. Did not eat breakfast so cannot comment but it seemed nice. They also had a promo for breakfast going on. If you have a short stay select this hotel you will not be disappointed.",3
12358,"Such a lovely little boutique hotel! We only stayed here for one night but it was definitely value for money.  The location is excellent, about a 5 minute walk from the square with many restaurants, bars and shops nearby.  Our room was small but nice, plenty of storage, clean and good air con.  Breakfast the next morning was the highlight. A small buffet, only €6, but the views of the acropolis were stunning. Absolutely beautiful.  The staff were really lovely and helpful. The male receptionist was very sweet and helped us get a taxi and told us the best places to visit around the area.  Overall, a lovely little hotel with great service.",3
4304,"All you want in a London hotel: clean, quiet, safe, service oriented. We stayed there for 4 nights, used the breakfast service twice.  10 minutes walk from the station.  Staff are friendly, service oriented. Attention to detail.   Recommend!",3
27226,"My new favourite place to stay in Nanjing with family. Stayed in the family suite for two weeks and it felt like a home away from home. From check-in to check-out, staff were vigilant and very happy to assist.  Stayed on the 8th floor family suite. It featured very spacious and comfortable bedrooms, with a separate living room and kitchen, which felt more like living in an apartment than a hotel. Large bathrooms with smart toilets are a nice touch. Special mention to Mrs. Xie from housekeeping for being so efficient at maintaining room standards.  Had breakfast on both the 2nd floor (Xuan Cafe) and 40th floor (Horizon Club). Xuan Cafe had the most variety of food (Eastern and Western options) and had that bustle found in most hotel breakfast halls. For a more peaceful experience, the Horizon Club would be my pick. With just the essential Eastern and Western food varieties, it’s enough to keep you satisfied, while made to order requests are happily fulfilled by staff.  The Horizon Club (40th floor) comes fully recommended from previous reviewers and it did not disappoint. There is complimentary cakes, savory foods, tea and coffee throughout the day. In the evening, from 5:30pm to 7:30pm ""happy hour"" offers free beers, whiskey, wines, etc for you to enjoy.  Dinner options at Jiangnan Wok offers a wide range Huaiyang cuisine and it is a decent option if you don’t want to leave the hotel for the night. Additionally, the Western option, Flame On 40, situated on the same floor as the Horizon Club, Australian steak can be found on the menu, giving my family a friendly reminder of home.  All in all, a very positive experience from a proven hotel chain. First time staying in Shangri-La Nanjing and I honestly think it won't be the last.  Lastly, please commend Randy on his outstanding customer service. His positive nature and his hospitality is a standout to our family. Thank you very much for making us feel so welcome, he is a great asset and a positive reflection of Shangri-La standards!",3
44223,"This place is amazing. It clean, the staff is friendly the customer service is very good. I felt really comfortable. I like how my room was set up with tea, sugar, coffee and creamer, 2 bottles of Figi water and a Portland spring bottle of water.  ",3
19965,"Very charming hotel. Well located in a good neighborhood, close to trains and subway stations, as well as bus stops and bike parking stations for lease.

The room was wonderful, clean, tidy and cared for. We stayed for 9 nights and would happily spend another 9.   If you've read a few reviews, you'll notice Massimo, the hotel manager's name pop up, there is very good reason. He was fantastic throughout our stay, making sure our experience was as good as could be, and was proactive at every point for  making the time away the best. We thank you and your team for such a wonderful time.  Also, the buffet - Brilliant. you would not leave hungry (we certainly didnt) Thank you.",3
52173,"I want to commend the staff especially Paolo and Dalton from the front desk. Very professional yet hospitable. Mr. Paolo still managed to remember us, appreciated it much. Lots of questions and concerns were asked and were answered very well. We enjoyed our stay because we were given a pool view(first among 4 stays) housekeeping staff surprised us with cakes, balloons and decos.. and so happy to see my youngest enjoying her little bear..simple yet big impact to my little one..thank you Mr. Dalton. Room service and housekeeping also granted our requests right away with a short phone call. Executive lounge ladies are accomodating and lovely to know that they gave time to interact with my 2-yr old girl while they are working on their computer.. Facilities are safe and secured (elevator and pool access) Overall Satisfied. Thank you Hilton Manila..see you till next staycation and that would be hopefully soon!",3

21313,"This is a great hotel and it turned out perfect for us :-)  We had a terrace garden room, it was so lovely, a pergola strewn with bourgainvillea and a table and chairs where we sat with a glass of wine in an evening. Our room was nice, clean and with an area to make a cuppa. The bathroom wasn't perfect but fine for our needs, just depends on how picky you want to be. Our room was serviced everyday. We had free towels for the poolside and were given free loungers and sun brolly on the beach. The staff are so friendly and so willing to help, just ask them anything and they do their utmost to help and with a smile. One small criticism is the breakfast, it is limited and the same everyday, a little variety would of made all the difference. The beach is literally over the road, its black volcanic tiny pebble sand but the sea was warm and clear for swimming in. Either side of the hotel you have all the amenities you could wish for, water sports, restaurants, shops, local bus stop. We had a fantastic time on Santorini and its so beautiful, if you visit please go to The Santos Winery...the most beautiful place you will ever sit and have a glass of wine :-) Enjoy",3

Rooms have fridges, complimentary dental kits (brush + toothpaste), heat and air conditioning and three layers of curtains to block the sun when you want to sleep.  Sometimes when you google the neighborhood, Exarcheia, you see a bunch of overblown nonsense about how it isn’t a ‘safe’ area. I can assure you that it’s completely safe, if not as posh as some other neighborhoods of Athens.   Would stay here again 100%.",3
60,"Great hotel, great location, price is outstanding. Hotel is clean and staff was super nice.  Our room had an awesome view of the Manhattan Bridge Arch. I had reservations about staying here because I didn't know the area and the price was much more affordable than others. I was pleased when we arrived and saw it in person. I would definitely recommend this hotel.  ",3
36626,"Loved the location. We walked everywhere and this neighborhood Psirri was great with reaturants, bars and shop and less touristy than nearby Plaka.  Breakfast was wonderful and so was all the staff.  My only gripe would be we missed our 1st night due to our flight getting rescheduled and we still were charged for the room that night(although we were comped at the restaurant). The road its on looks a bit seedy with all the graffiti, but i would stay there again over Plaka.  Nice rooms as well and the front desk was always helpful.",3
16703,This is a new hotel in a great location ideal for both business and pleasure. The staff are very welcoming and helpful with nothing being too much trouble.

19657,"When we arrived there was no long and we got here at exactly 4pm. Miguel Mendez checked us in. He was so polite and answered any questions i had. I also informed him that it was my birthday and i choose to spend it here and he made sure i was off to a great start. He provided me and my family with a free restaurant voucher and a free bar drink. He honored my free parking pass as well. He smiled and made jokes with us and made us feel really welcomed. Only downside was i room wasn’t ready yet and we had to wait an hour but that wasn’t his fault. We just hung out and ate at the shop on site. Once we got to the room, the room was clean and it was exactly what I paid for. We are on the fourth floor and we had in Lakeview. so far we have had a great experience. I will say be prepared for the fees I paid 367 and resort fees, and $300 for incidentals, which is not bad for a Resort. Overall,  so good so far. ",3
43771,"I stayed in fira for two nights and had exactly the experience I was looking for. The rates were reasonable, the staff was helpful and friendly, the room was nice/ clean and the location was perfect.    If you're looking for a hotel with a view this isn't the place but if your like me a hotel is just a place to rest.    For all the reasons above I'd highly recommend Antonia apartments.     ",3
10478,"Very relaxing!  Service and staff were friendly, helpful, and always there when needed.   Rooms: I don’t recommend the private oceanfront terrace if you’re wanting a 24/7 ocean view. Once you sit down in the lounge chairs, you can’t see over the privacy wall.   The eucalyptus smell was a tad overpowering but easily fixed when I put the diffuser bottle outside on the terrace.  I look forward to coming back and hope to do so sooner than later",3

13746,"We stayed in the hotel in low-season during September 2016 for 3 nights and enjoyed it much more than all other hotels we've seen in south east asia so far (Siem Reap, Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Tioman among those).  It is to emphasize how friendly, helpful and attentive all stuff of the hotel is. One of them even borrowed his personal motor bike to make us more familiar with driving before we rented one by ourselves, but this is just a single example.   The rooms are large in size, very(!) clean, have a nice charm and definitely nothing is missing, from umbrella over basic cutlery to local guides you'll find everything you need. Amazingly, the pool can be used 24 hours and the although the hotel has not a direct view to the sea, it has a spatially distinct restaurant (5 min walking distance), where you can enjoy your substantial and diverse breakfast while facing the ocean (and there are even hotel-intern drivers bringing you over there for free).",3
65809,"Great hotel, great location.  Was walking distance to the Montparasse Tower - which is well worth a visit.  Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower although we only done this once as we got day tickets for the metro line which meant you could hop on and off all day around Paris. It’s worth buying a day ticket if you want to see lots of sites as there are lots of metro stations dotted around.  Breakfast had a varied selection and catered well for families.  The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.   We didn’t have a great view and the room was fairly small for a family but nonetheless was clean.  My only complaint would be that the coffee and milk wasn’t replenished at all. I’m sure I could have gone to reception to ask for some.   All in all a fantastic a hotel and would stay again.",3
33988,"Based on location it’s a great place. Easy to access from Ueno main station or Skyliner from Narita even with suitcases. 3-4 minute walk.  Rooms smallish - but standard for Japan. But clean and an efficient service all round.  The hotel is in the heart of lively Ueno with cafes, bars, good restaurants and a shopping mall nearby and easy access to central Tokyo and Shibuya on Ginza line Recommended!",3
30151,"This lovely boutique hotel is exactly as described.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, the room is well appointed with a lovely bathroom and comfortable bed.  I loved the roof top pool.  Location is excellent for public transport and sightseeing.  Unfortunately my airport taxi driver didn't know where the hotel entrance was so he got lost but we found the place to stop eventually.  The restaurant staff were very friendly (filled my water bottle each day), though I didn't get a chance to eat there.  I'll definitely stay here again on my next Singapore trip.",3

The food was delicious and love the variety as well as the decor in each restaurant. I love how there were plenty of activities and entertainment everyday!

We will definitely be returning as again this was an all around amazing and unforgettable vacation! I wish we could have stayed longer!!! ",3
51884,I didn’t stay in the hotel but I really had a wonderful time in the brewery.

Really friendly and helpful reception staff and the infinity pool had the most amazing views over Athens. Centrally located and near the tube if you want to visit outside of Athens. We took a lovely boat trip to the beautify Island of Hydra too and explored as much of Athens as we could. A wonderful stay.",3

There is also a co-ed hot tub, spa in each locker room and friendly concierge. After check in we were sent to the concierge to give us suggestions for the town which was very unique and nice.",3
54172,Great location close to everything! We were welcomed with a Turkish tea and had a great room overlooking the Hagia Sophia. Breakfast was on the balcony every morning overlooking the water on one side and Hagia Sophia on the other. What makes this hotel amazing is Rambo - what a lovely gentleman who really made us feel at home and couldn’t do enough for us!,3
23850,"Elegance at its finest, by far this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at and trust me I have stayed at some very nice hotel, at least in humble opinion.  First it is literally a two minute walk from Milan’s Central train station which made it so easy to get around and go to other cities.  Next when you first enter and see the foyer you immediately know that this place is going to wow you and it knocked my socks off.  The black modern décor and sweet aroma meets you at every turn.  Our room was on the corner and pretty much all glass windows which gave us a great view of the city life around us.  We used the spa and pool and they were superb.  The staff was exceptional and very attentive to our needs.  Lest I forget the best breakfast experience with superb food and coffee.  Wait there is more if you get a chance go to roof top bar refreshment and a stunning view.",3
65917,"Loved everything about the Driskill - the location was ideal, the amenities were first rate & the service was exceptional. We will definitely be back and are looking forward to enjoying their bar/Happy Hour again!",3
53254,"Trendy, modern hotel that sits directly below Buda Castle and across from the Chain Bridge.  The views from my fifth floor room were amazing.  The staff could not have been friendlier and more accommodating. With bus and metro stops in front of the hotel I could get anywhere I wanted to go quickly and easily while staying on the quieter Buda side. Budapest is a beautiful city to which I will return. I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Clark again.",3

27094,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in in Europe.  Top notch from start to finish…great staff, great room, free breakfast, 24/7 free snacks, great location in the heart of Barcelona.  Roof top terrace has great views over the city and features a fully stocked “honesty bar” (not sure of term).  Do yourself a favour and stay here.",3
8953,"Very warm and atypical hotel a team with the small care, much of softness, very attentive and very smiling. I highly recommend it. It is very small but so cute, we feel really good The suite with the garden is very comfortable, a lot of space to live and always a little gift by our hosts",3
65204,"Clean and all essential amenities included. I arrived early morning from airport and received by a courteous young man. He kept my luggage so I can enjoy a Brooklyn food tour. I freshened up at a basement toilet and got some hot water at basement pantry. Unfortunately I got a twin room facing the Manhattan Bridge. The hotel double panel the only window but I could still hear the vibration of the subway throughout the night.  I was worried about safety at night but luckily too jet lag to want to plan late night outings. I do hear loud shouting outside my window after 2am. The hotel is situated at Main Street, so I do think a safer choice in Chinatown.",3
16479,"Had a really lovely stay at Galatia Villas. Staff were so accommodating, easy process booking and communicating with them before arrival.   They arranged a transfer from the airport and to the port,€10 per person which is about the standard rate for Santorini.   Very well located place, 10 minute walk into Fira town, mini mart near by and nice views.   We had a room for 3 people, it was a little tight for space but they had made us aware of that before booking which was nice. The room itself was clean, air conditioned and we had the luxury of the jacuzzi on the balance next to us. The shower was powerful, albeit very small but couldn’t complain.   Would definitely come back again, such good value for money.",3

53408,"New York is home. It’s my crowning place of peace even amidst the chaos. And whenever I travel home, I usually don’t choose hotels based off location, but given the perimeters of this trip, location was key. Dream Midtown peaked my interest at first glance, but I kept searching — as I can be a bit picky at times. But something kept drawing me back to Dream Midtown. So I said, “what the hell” and booked it. I did want to be close to Central Park, Times Square, and a swift walking distance to restaurant row. So it seemed like the perfect location, and how it seemed is exactly how it turned out to be. The check-in was great and informative. The room was clean and cozy. But the highlight was the hotel employees, whom were all so polite, warm, and personable. I stopped by the front desk on my way out to visit friends, and was greeted by Angel. I just asked a quick question about some food places I was thinking of trying and he was able to give some insight, which I greatly appreciated. Throughout my stay, when he would see him, he would ask how my stay was going and make conversation… which I greatly appreciated! His warm and friendly demeanor was a the breath of fresh air. Always so kind to offer assistance even when I didn’t need it. But I received it as his way of letting me know he was always there to help in any way, which was very comforting.   My trip to New York was a 10/10. Mostly because of the hotel, but mainly because of Angel. It’s not often you come across genuine and kind people. But when you do, it makes life all the better. My stay wouldn’t have been the same without him. There’s certain people you can just tell they walk through life adding light to people’s lives, and he’s one of them.   Thank you, Angel!",3

The staff are the most amazing I have ever encountered in my travels, always ready with a smile, and nothing is a bother, even when the customers are demanding and rude. Jam, Ken, and Chris (our Aussie name for him) made our stay simply the best. Please do book and stay at Horizon Beach",3

The service in Lounge also superb. Thanks to Ms Wira for her great service. ",3

Also there are multiple subway lines and direct train to airport. The price is reasonable with good facilities in the hotel like gym, indoor swimming pool and coin laundry. the room temperature is perfect as some hotel is super hot. The room also has bath tub and shower, perfect for a long stay like us we stay for 2 weeks. The breakfast is good too. the staff is very helpful as one of my friend is sick and they willing to get an extra room for her rest and take good care of us.

32844,"I want to thank the excellent team at the MOTYO for delivering a flawless offsite for our management team. The execution was pitch perfect and the hospitality as warm as the bright Tokyo sunshine on a clear spring day!   Our pre-arrival was coordinated efficiently and, despite the many changes and demands, cheerfully. Thanks for being our partners as we planned arrivals from multiple countries and continents, and working through our colleagues’ busy and changing schedules. We really appreciate your accommodation of our requests including very early check-ins for a couple of guests and special late check-out arrangements for our group. More than a few of them were very complimentary of their arrival experience, and many raved about the fresh and sweet strawberries that welcomed them in their rooms.    Daisuke-san, Suzuki-san and the events centre team were wonderful hosts during our event. From the “dress rehearsal” to the coffee breaks and the excellently presented bento lunch, everything ran like clockwork and I always felt confident that we were in good hands. I must really commend Daisuke-san for his diligence in following up on every request and detail. His restaurant recommendations were also right on point – Sushi Yanone and Teppanyaki An provided a wonderful and diverse taste of Japan for the team. We loved the quaint and low-key environment (and of course the ultra-fresh sushi) of Yanone, and really enjoyed the marvelous views and lively vibes of An. It was a feat to find two restaurants that could cater to our large crowd and secure the reservations.    Thank you once again for helping us create such a memorable and successful event. Suffice to say you have now won new “Fans” from across the globe, and they will only have one home-away-from-home in mind when they next visit Tokyo!",3
2786,"Hotel du Danube was an amazing experience. If you and your significant other are looking for a magical place to stay in Paris, this is it. The hotel is quaint and welcoming. We stayed on a balcony room which truly did add to the magic. The staff made us feel so welcome and so at home. They recommended great cafes and made sure we were always taken care of. As well, th hotel location itself seems to be the best of that in St German as we were walking distance from anything and everything we wanted to do and see. The hotel is right around the corner from the two most popular cafes in all of Paris (Flore and Magots).  I cannot wait to go back to Paris and I will be looking to stay at Danube again! ",3
58850,"My partner and I visited this hotel in early July and had mixed thoughts before going, due to the varied reviews. We noticed that the reviews from the start of 2013 were much more positive.  When we arrived at the hotel we were already very impressed about the service and facilities available. We had a great week and the hotel was everything we expected and more.   On the second day we booked to go on a quad biking excursion through a member of the resorts, activities team called Yousef. We were a little wary about organizing excursions outside of our travel agent rep, but had a fantastic time, with such great staff running the 4 hour trip around the island, we had no concerns and the day was highly memorable.  We also booked through our rep to go on the sunset pirate ship cruise which was brilliant, an evening/ night full of entertainment, dancing and fun. this trip was a real different experience which was well organised and great for an evening outside of the hotel, as there was little to do around the local area, hence the hotels mostly being all inclusive.  We also visited the market on a Thursday, which we used the taxi service (which itself was great, drivers always outside the hotel and very cheap prices). The market wasn't as big as expected but really brought up our haggling skills and allowed us to get some good souvenirs.  The hotel was redecorated over the winter period and appears to have improved dramatically. The main thing that stood out for us were the friendly staff, al a carte restaurant (we went on the Tunisian night, absolutely delicious), the amazing all inclusive activities and drinks. Kayaking and windsurfing was included at the private beach and you could order a bottle of wine to your table at the buffet restaurant.   We feel for the price this hotel was exceptional and felt that one main reason for the deal is that the hotel is trying to increase it's status and possible star rating. I would certainly recommend this hotel and not to be put off by previous poor ratings, as it appears a lot has changed!",3
54681,Spent a weekend at this hotel on the recommendation of a friend and had a fantastic time.  It was just the right size for a single traveler and situated within walking distance of everything you might want to see in South Beach.  The room was sweet and the property well-maintained.   I will be back!!!,3
20138,We really enjoyed our stay here. It was the perfect little boutique hotel in a great location. The breakfast was great and staff were very friendly.

It was cosy, well located (bus and tramway nearby) and all the staff is really dedicated to the customers: helpful and smiley in a professionnal way. Top roof bar is lovely and really good. Great contemporary hôtel with beautiful rooms with everything you may need. Décoration is just great and innovative. We’ll go again for another break. Thanks to all the staff you made our weekend so cool.",3
2938,"Went here for 4 days with family. Superb service and polite staff. The food is to die for. You are spoilt for choice breakfast, lunch and dinner with a great selection of food and drinks. The great thing is its ALL INCLUSIVE. Eat as much as you want and drink as much as you want from the bar for no additonal cost. The pool area is great with plenty of deck chairs and water slides. Room is  great with a fantastic shower area. It is about 15 minutes walk from Kemer town. They have a great night life too with a club upstairs which is always live. You will literally have no reason to leave the resort. Had a fantastic stay! Only moan is, they have a few stray cats in the basement area walking around. I am not fond of animals but I am sure this doesn't affect the majority.",3

27309,We enjoyed our stay the staff was very good all around the hotel. There were lots of pools and never over crowded. The all inclusive was much better than any others we’ve been too. Great selection of food and alcohol. Adult pool had top shelf liquor and fun atmosphere. ,3

40479,"We have stayed here several times and will definately stay here again next time we come to Praque.  The entire staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are modern and clean and the food is great.  You can get on a bus right in front of the Hotel and be at the Metro station ""Skalka"" about 12 minutes later.  From Skalka the subway goes directly downtown to all the tourist destinations.  The hotel is in a quiet location, has a large parking lot and is easy to find.  We did not use the Wellness facilities because we preferred to spend our evenings in their courtyard with a cool beer or glass of wine instead.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a quiet, romantic, hotel with clean rooms and great service.",3
55154,We had a lovely stay at the Mondrian in Doha in the lovely pearl area of Doha. The hotel was in a great location for reaching any area in Doha.  The room & facilities were great  including the breakfast which had great options available to cater for all needs and tastes.  The highlight of our stay was the lovely ‘Wish-Wish’ who we assumed was the manager due to her professional and hospitable nature. She made our stay much more welcoming and gave us a full tour of hotel.   My only complaint is that there is not more staff like Wish-wish at the hotel.,3

62840," We spent six weeks at the Corinthia for a business trip and once again the hotel exceeded our expectations.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a welcoming staff member. We love staying here not just for the beauty of the hotel and its location to good restaurants, shops, and sights, but also for the wonderful service. The staff members and management always make us feel very welcome and at home.   The room was very nice and spacious, with a comfortable bed and plenty of space for our long stay. We included access to the Royal Spa which was beautiful and very relaxing. Also, we included access to the executive Lounge and meeting Saqip and Zaina was so nice. They made sure we were always happy.  The breakfast buffet at the Brasserie and Atrium was a delight with a variety of foods to choose from and as always excellent service from Chef Lorenzo and all the staff.   The bar area was fun specially when live music played, we enjoyed visiting Le Bar for specialty drinks and dinner. Our experience at the hotel is always an unforgettable one. We for sure will be visiting soon and recommended to anyone traveling to Budapest either for business or pleasure.  ",3

31627,This hotel was in a spot that was close to our Client.  It's pretty much isolated (in a very good way). I just liked that there were not many cars driving past the hotel.  The doors are thin but that's okay since the other guests weren't loud.  It's close to Target and other places that might be useful for people. It's not too far from the freeway either. I liked that it was 100% smoke free. There was plenty of parking. Staff was always very friendly and helpful. I would stay again.  ,3

Also Martha, Jose Delgado, José Manuel and Jany are fantastic stewards of hospitality!  They always made sure my requests and needs were met each day.  Each and every employee of this hotel exemplifies superior customer service unlike any other hotel I have ever experienced. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mexico City!! ",3
30738,Was my go to hotel back in the days but now is showing a bit age. The rooms are spacious and solid but other new 5 star properties in the area make this place a little behind the curve now. The food is surprising solid for a W but otherwise nothing spectacular. Great accessibility though.,3
21792,"We stayed 5 nights in March 2019. The room was very small, with no coffee. Navigation to our room from the front-desk was a challenge also, as there are 2 buildings involved. Those are the negatives of our stay. Everything else was great.  The room came with a complimentary breakfast at the buffet on the ground floor. It was simple, but adequate. Scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, rice, breads, cereals, and beverages. The best part of the buffet was our host, Chan-Im Park (spelling??). Chan was great with our 3 year old daughter who became very ill during our stay. Chan was extremely helpful, and took it upon herself to not only find a good hospital (Severance), but call them on our behalf. We took our daughter to the hospital and it was a great experience with the care we received. We want to say Thank You to Chan for her caring assistance. Our daughter also threw up on the bed in our room, and housekeeping got right on the clean-up, without making us feel bad or embarrassed. The staff made a tough time for our Family much easier to handle, and we thank them. The location of this hotel is great also.

22812,We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and absolutely loved it. Nice comfortable beds and walking distance to everything. Friendly staff too. Just washrooms were a bit cramped but still workable. Would recommend!,3
46517,"Very affordable, no harbour views but Museum Station is just across the road, and it is two Stations to get to Circular Quay.   Room was very neat and spacious.  The breakfast included is adequate, to start your day exploring Sydney.    Nice outlook to the park across the road.",3
8359,"The hotel property has an excellent location, the beach is great. The front desk was relatively unfriendly, however, the bellman was super nice. I will definitely return, however I hope the management trains the front desk to be more polite. It is not a cheap hotel and it should show that with the attitude of the employees.",3
24718,"The hotel has Good service, convenient place, glad to have nice and supportive staff. Nice view good to have this place in new territory, hope to come here again. The counter staff Amber is so nice and helpful. ",3
55035,"We stayed here at the start and end of our trip. A bit of a splurge for us. The rooms were comfortable (though the garden view double we were in first had a very awkward shower with a handheld head whose hose was too short for where it was attached).  Street noise was a bit of a problem, though I suspect that is true of most hotels in the area, and it eased up late at night. The location is very convenient for sightseeing.  We really enjoyed eating breakfast on the deck.  Hotel staff were very helpful.",3
45768,"Stunning Resort! Absolute top, by entering the lobby, you feel the relaxation starts. The whole layout of the resort, the architecture of the main buildings, the landscaping it just fabulous.  The main pool is one of the best we ever seen and had the pleasure to enjoy.  If you visit the resort, take a free of charge bike and explore the resort, so many hidden gems and beautiful corners. Absolutely one of my favorite places so far,  We will definitely come back. ",3
40593,"We had a wonderful stay at Club Med Guilin from the first moment we arrived at Guilin Train Station. Club Med staff arranged for pick up for our merry crew of 5 (including 1 teen and 2 preteens.)  We were warmly welcomed at the door of Club Med with a hot drink on a chilly afternoon.  Because of our late arrival, we stopped at the noodle bar for a quick snack. The noodles really hit the spot.  Our rooms were warm, clean and had a lovely view.  Everyone at Club Med was so welcoming and kind. All our needs were anticipated and provided for.  I loved listening to the singers Neri & Odie during the French dinner and breakfast.  They radiate positive vibes and make any room come alive.  Their voices enhanced the vacation vibe.   Happy Appy (fitness instructor) led a fun pre-dinner game of chair volleyball and made our teens smile. Not an easy task!  Every time he ran into us,  he was eager to serve or provide information. Aron, Milk and Janly were all warm and kind throughout our reservation, check in and check out.   We never felt cold even though the days were chilly outside.  Shout out to our biking leader who smiled throughout our wet ride in the forest. It was wonderful to spend time outdoors in beautiful Guilin.   Big thank you to  Mia for taking care of our kids in the teens club. They had a fantastic time wall climbing, golfing and playing archery. When we met our kids after the morning activities, they were full of smiles.  We enjoyed all the food and the bartenders were kind and were able to make drinks not on the menu and even retrieve ingredients from another building to make special drinks.  Even the GM, greeted us and knew the details of our stay.  Such attention to detail is the mark of an excellent hotel. We left Club Med Guilin with full hearts while watching the staff wave us farewell.  We wish we had stayed longer, but know that we will visit again. ",3
59712,"We stayed here over the weekend and it was more than we expected. The views from the restaurant and pool area were fantastic. The food is great, good value for money. Room was spacious and the gym was just wow!! Didn't get a chance to use the Spa but perhaps on our next trip.",3

The same goes for the staff in restaurant. All this makes the stay feels like home even when you have to work. The complimentary bottle of Prosecco and fhe personalized welcome note is the cherry on top! Super service guys, Don’t want to stay anywhere else!",3
10680,"I had one of my most fond experiences in this hotel, everything was beautiful, the beach and pool staff are amazing but the attention of Ramardo and Geronimo the bellman’s was something else, they were on top of every detail, helped us plan our days and trips and helped us with some problems with our room . I would come back in a heartbeat. See you next year!!",3
37070,"What a fantastic time we had here. From the moment we checked in everything was fabulous. Spotlessly clean, our executive room was sizeable and very comfortable. Bed was huge (I have to mention the fact the bed was made so well that the sheets never moved or creased first time I have experienced this EVER!) so comfy with lovely bedding. Shower was powerful and hot. Executive lounge was well staffed and food constantly refilled on our two visits. Breakfast was presented beautifully with something for everyone. Shoutout to Lily who checked us in, booked us on a fab trip and checked us out. All staff were friendly and efficient. Would definitely stay again. Travel was so easy even from airport. Shame we were not here longer!",3
23792,"Great location - literally across from Milano Centrale.  It was a great base to explore Milan and for day trips in the area.  Considering how centrally located and busy it is outside, the room was surprisingly serene.  Every staff we ran into, from housekeeping to restaurant and front desk, was friendly and helpful.  The room was well appointed with every amenity one could ever need.  It was a great stay!",3
53810,"It’s always been the Hotel we stay every time we visit Bangkok. It’s the best location for everything. Restaurants, bars, clubs, malls, hospital, etc. are just around the corner and the best service experience with the staff. Everyone are so warm and hospitable and the Duty Manager ( Julia ) will never fail to assist you with any concerns and always do their best to give the best service. ",3
11841,Concierge Extraordinaire Ms. Gisela Castruita (Chief Concierge) is amazing.

She is an amazing asset to Concierge team and Sofitel Hotel.,3

After a bit of a bumpy start the team tried hard to make this an outstanding stay, many thanks for that.  I will spare you the review of location, villas and so on. Everything is great.  The outstanding friendliness of the Thai people in and around the Hotel make this country really the best place for holidays.",3

42418,"This boutique hotel is a little hidden at the base of Love Hill which is pretty interesting in itself. We stayed with 2 teenage boys over new year and had a great time. The rooms are cosy but well equipped and the deluxe queen we stayed in had a great steam room.  You wouldn’t stay here if you intend to spend time relaxing in your room but if all you need is a really comfortable place to crash then this is comfortable, safe and the staff are great. A few more food/breakfast options in the bar downstairs would add some value to early arrival travellers. ",3
36746,"In this hotel you will feel very welcomed and great staff will try to take care of any need you might have during your stay. We were worried about the location which is a bit far from the city centre but the transport is easy as the hotel offers shuttle to train station nearby, making it then just a 15 min ride to Piazza del popolo. Comfortable rooms and nice atmosphere in the hotel, as well as nice environment around it. We were very happy with choosing this place and recommend it!",3
34610,As I'm not a big fun of Holiday Inn I have to say that this one in Zhuhai is great. Perfect rooms and service. Lots of restaurants in the building. Convenient location for drop-off by colleagues. In Executive room free local beer or Coke. Fast free internet and quite air-condition.,3

Highly recommend.",3
32630,"Very smoothly run, I found it very easy check-in. Also, the location is in the heart of TST and cannot be any better than this. Room was very very clean, high up enough so you don't get hit by the busy city noise. I also found it easy and fun to communicate with Mike.",3
3734,We enjoyed the pool. The stuff is kind. The room was also very clean. The shampoo was also of good quality. It was a little difficult to understand the English of the person at the front desk. I had a taxi chartered.,3
49358,Fantastic hotel placed very close to the beach. Hotel service very kindly and professional. Excellent food. I'm sure I will get back there soon. Even during winter time a lot of activities and no single minute wasted on being bored.,3
59303,"By far the best introduction to London.  My phone died and I had no adapter.  After many hours of both exploring and looking for the Walrus, I finally found it :)  I must have looked sweaty, lost, and thirsty, because I was given a beer right away -haha.  Check-in was easy and they have specials for guests.  When you get out make a left and go through the tunnel.. It was amazing --there is a venue in the middle of it.  After a long night, you can hangout and watch the street artists paint their heart out.  If you are looking for a quiet paradise.. This is not it --this place is for the open minded and for those who are truly seeking to submerge into the English culture. Can't wait until I visit again!",3
34440,"We had a great family time . Amazing views from the hotel , very friendly service from all the staff, great facilities for children especially on Easter Day as they enjoyed an Easter egg hunt, face painting games archery etc . This hotel also has a mini zoo which we all enjoyed as well as an organic farm . The food for breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful . The only downside was the coffee machine which kept stopping ! The bedrooms with our private balcony are beautifully decorated the beds very comfy and the bathroom was big with both a bath and a great shower . We also enjoyed relaxing in Horizon watching the bamboo dance and the dance show . Thank you to all the staff who made our Easter break a very enjoyable one indeed ! We stayed in room 337 and 339.

27913,"It's a great structure! I can't really say that it's like a homestay, because my home is not as beautiful as this place (I wish it was so....). Great and friendly staff!! Location is perfect. I was there for the second time, and if I ever have the chance to come back in BKG, I will surely book again!! Thanks for the great stay!!!",3
34425,"It was great timing to stay at Shangri-La for New Year, they had a party in the lobby bar with extremely cheap price as a ticket for per person to enjoy all the high-quality drinks, we enjoyed all the different kinds of cocktails, wine and beer, and the Philippine band was really good. Shangri-La has always been our choice for vacation because of their great team, but this time for our stay we really appreciate Nicky who is the manager of Ubar, he organized the party, he is super nice and very professional, and he provided the excellent hospitality service to our table, so we had the first and fantastic New Year's Party with Shangri-La in Guilin.",3
19361,"What a wonderful small intimate boutique B&B out of the hustle and bustle of Rome.

Highly recommend this stress free environment at Palm Gallery. ",3
19727,"I have now visited Santorini 5 times over the past 21 years. When I chose Hotel Reverie, I was looking for somewhere just outside Fira (which is getting very busy now) but close enough to walk into Fira or Imerovigli. Firostefani is just between the two. Most importantly, I wanted views of the Caldera but without paying over the odds for it.  Hotel Reverie looked just that, a small family run hotel, about 10-15 minute walk from Fira, situated just on the main walkway between Fira to Oia. We chose the Suite for 6 nights but still paying less than some other options but still retaining the views with added space and a private balcony as well as the hotel’s shared roof top terrace.  From the moment we booked, the service was excellent. I took up the offer of the airport collection (Thank you George!) service for 20 euros. On arrival, Nikolina looked after us, explained everything about the local area and excursions or other services she could help arrange, such as hire car or quads. Our room was excellent! The Suite consists of an open plan lounge/kitchen/dining area with french doors opening onto a small private balcony overlooking the pathway with some views of the caldera but blocked by the nearby restaurants. A small staircase takes you up to a bedroom area, with two comfy chairs looking out through a large window with unobscured views of the caldera! The bed was comfortable and we slept well. Our room was right next to the hotel shared terrace which also has clear views of the caldera, perfect for enjoying the sunset. The hotel does have a small pool and a few sunbeds but this is right in the middle of other guest rooms and a general walkway and mostly in the shade, so we only sat around the pool once for a few hours. But when in Santorini, who stays at their hotel!? Reverie is in a perfect central location to explore the island, 10-15 minute walk to Fira, Imerovigli or even Oia if you are happy to walk for about 2 hours! Reverie is on a main road through Firostefani with plenty of free parking outside and nearby so perfect if you get a hire car or quad to explore the island with, which we did, arranged by Nikolina. We also took up the option of a boat tour around the island, again organised by Nikolina. We only had breakfast once but at 10euros each, it was well worth it and excellent quality, prepared and cooked freshly whilst you wait. There are plenty of restaurants/tavernas nearby but my favourite was Taverna Romantica, a few minutes walk away with fantastic food and service. Overall, a great little family run hotel, providing a peaceful, relaxing stay but central enough to enjoy the sights of Santorini and nightlife if you want to. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again myself. (Nikolina and Elias, thank you for looking after us and making us feel so welcome)",3
50728,We rented a deluxe cottage on the beach at Fishermans Cove for 3 days/2nights. It was wonderfully relaxing. Enjoyed quiet time with the family. The food was outstanding. The cottage air conditioning was welcome especially during the hot afternoon hours.  The beach was clean and mostly deserted. It was nice to be able to watch the sunrise each morning. The Seagull restaurant had a spectacular offering of various types of cuisine.,3
9564,Roze Eda Tunc was excellent with her cooking but more importantly always carried a smile whenever she serves. Overall the staff were polite and place was very clean. The seafood was a little disappointing eg: the salmon sushi/sashimi were mostly broken. ,3
9491,"Comfortable world-class stay. Chic ambience throughout, great staff at front desk. Extraordinary breakfast with fresh vegetables, fruit, meats, cheeses, pastry, presented beautifully. Hotel room is luxurious and spotless. Those who are handicapped will have trouble climbing the 20 or so steps to front entrance (unless there is another entrance I am not aware of). Well done, Hyatt.",3

4814,"Spent 4N here. Check-in was swift in the small and simply decorated lobby... and not moment too soon as the front desk was soon checking-in a busload of tourists (this seems to be very popular with large tour groups). As a Plat, I was upgraded to a suite, with a large toilet and walk in wardrobe. Rooms were spotless, comfy bed, speedy wifi. Courteous staff throughout. Had a burger at the bar but patty was overcooked. Thankfully breakfast (comprising the typical 4 Points spread) was better.",3

24027,"I would totally recommend this hotel if needing a place in central london.  Although the rooms are snug they are very clean and modern, the beds are comfy, the black out blinds work wonders and they have a real cosy feel.  The hotel staff were really friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful.  The location is excellent. A 2 minute walk to Oxford street, a 5 minute walk in the other direction to Piccadilly and a 10 minute walk to Covent Garden.  It was exactly what we needed and for a great price!",3
30949,"We stayed for 2 nights...we booked with orlandovacations as a package with our SeaWorld tickets.  The room is a good value there's 1 bedroom with a door and then a separate sleeping area with bunkbeds-unfortunately there's no door there so the kids didn't sleep too well.  There's a pullout couch that's not very comfortable but serves its purpose too. Unfortunately there's only 1 bathroom. Our room had a view of the waterpark...we enjoyed the pool both days the water was a little cold but it was fun and there were 2 hot tubs a Waterpark area with slides and basketball too. It was a bit of a walk to the pool entrance from our room though. We enjoyed our stay :) it was dissapointing that there was no free continental breakfast...it was a buffet for over $20 a person in their ""mall"" area.",3

46191,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Courtyard Paris Gare de Lyon on 3 occasions during our recent visit to Europe. We were so taken by the friendly and welcoming reception desk staff, especially Nicolas, Yanis, and Laia. They were so helpful for all our needs, really going out of their way to assist us. And each time we came back for another stay it felt like coming home with their warm smiles. We had rooms with fabulous views of either the Eiffel Tower or the Clock Tower of the Gare de Lyon train station. I also really appreciated being so close to the train/metro to get around and out of the city. We were also in a good location to catch boats on the Seine River and see the sites.",3
29789,"My friend and I stayed at Hotel Plaka in January and we both enjoyed it. The location in the heart of the Plaka is convent to many restaurants and shopping, but also an easy walk to the Ancient Agora, and the Acropolis. Our room was quiet and clean, with room for two women and their stuff. The rooftop terrace bar was where we finished each nice with a drink and a dreamy view of the lit up Acropolis. Hotel Plaka puts out an excellent breakfast with a wide variety of food from the usual eggs and cereal to lovely pastries, olives, and fruit. Affordable. Highly recommended.",3
39961,it was lovely to stay there. From front desk they upgraded the room and gave me free drink coupons. Room was cosy and spacious for 2 people. It takes 8 mins from sinnonhyun subway station. Also the decorations at the 1st floor was marvelous which goes well with this season. ,3
23079,Most fun I ever had on a vacation.The animation team was awesome and I also enjoyed the waterslides. I consider those two to be the strongest points of the hotel. Accommodation was decent. Definitely coming back one day.(I actually visited the hotel in late July 2014),3
11481,"We stayed here last week with our two children ages 9 and 7.  ( not teens but I was forced to select).   They loved it, we loved it. The pool was excellent. Towels laid out for you.  A really pool team.  The rock was perfect. Clean, modern and spacious.  Wine hour at 5’and tea and coffee morning were a delightful bonus. Location was amazing for everything you’d need. Walking distance to art deco. Miami Beach at the back of the hotel- amazing!! Loved it. We’ll be back for sure. ",3

45336,Best Hostel so far! Really relaxed and the atmosphere is really nice and welcoming. The sleeping places are very confortable and the Garden is nice to relax after the Heat of Bangkok. If you want to have some quite relaxing days the Yard Hostel is absolutely the right Choice. :),3
2733,"Rooms were very clean and cleaned daily. Staff was very friendly and available 24/7. There is a rooftop you can access as well as affordable breakfast, although I did not use these services. This was my best hostel experience so far. Only complaint is that the shower is very small.",3

But staying at Novotel Sydney Central made things easier for us as it is in a great location near Central Station with lots of restaurants and a supermarket close by and within a close walk to Darling Square/Harbour. There’s Chinatown close by so you can always find things to do or eat at nights.   The room was clean and comfortable and included everything we needed - iron and ironing board, fridge, tea making facilities, tv, toiletries and safe.  Breakfast is average and not so much selections. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the team is happy to help.",3

2213,"A short walk from the Colosseum metro, only a matter of a few minutes, found us at the door of this place. The external surroundings and hall were a little rustic. We were met at the door by our host, who,like the others we met, were fantastic. Our room was beautiful, clean bright and spacious with high terracotta coloured brick ceilings, and the welcome bottle of wine, water and fruit in our room was much appreciated. Our host spoke excellent English and gave us lots of useful tips about where to go, how to get there, and good restaurants to try (we tried a few of his recommendations and they were really good). Breakfast was served daily at a time to suit us and set us up perfectly for each of the five days of our stay. The room was cleaned and the bed changed daily. Bottles of water are left in the room each day. Little touches by our host in checking that we had all we needed each day, and coming to say goodbye on our last day added to the quality of the experience. All the information they have us was perfectly accurate. There is something magical in stepping out on to a busy Rome road each morning and seeing the mighty Colosseum only a few hundred meters away. After we checked out we found that there was a transport strike affecting trains, the metro and some taxis. We were understandably concerned that we may not get to the airport on time. We needn't have worried. I rang our hosts to ask their advice and they arranged a taxi to take us to the airport (taxi fixed price Rome to Fumincino  airport is 48 euro). The taxi arrived bang on time and the driver was very polite. The whole experience was excellent and one which I would recommend to anyone wanting to explore this beautiful city and prepared to swap the  trappings of expensive hotels for a beautiful room on the doorstep of one of the wonders of the world, coupled with a high quality personal service delivered by wonderful polite people who go the extra mile. Thank you Marco and Aldo.",3

58932,"We have stayed in many a bed and breakfast but the Althea Inn Roof Terrace is now clearly at the top of the list! This is an excellent, highest quality accommodation. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and well decorated. The bed is super comfortable and the linens are great. We even had a sweet small terrace where we were able to breakfast in the mornings. The bathroom is not large but it is very modern and the shower, with its many shower heads, is the best! It was blisteringly hot during our four days in Rome which made us really appreciate the air conditioning which worked wonderfully and was a life saver! The breakfast, delivered to your room, was generous and delicious and attractively presented - fresh fruit, that could not be bettered, every morning! Alessandro and Cherish made our stay memorable and went out of their way to be helpful. A heartfelt thanks to them. Something to consider: the Inn is not in the center but it is very very close to the Metro and numerous bus lines so getting around Rome is super easy. Also, being a little removed from the center can be a blessing because Rome is a bustling, noisy, crowded city and it felt quite calm at the Althea. Testaccio, where it's located, is a foodie destination so there are lots and lots of fine restaurants to be discovered and the Aventino, much overlooked, is a delight to explore. Be good to yourself. Book a room. You won't regret it.",4
